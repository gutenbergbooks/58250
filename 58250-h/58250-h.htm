    <h2>
      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <p>
      To the eyes of a man viewing it from behind, the nut-brown hair was a
      wonder and a mystery. Under the black beaver hat, surmounted by its tuft
      of black feathers, the long locks, braided and twisted and coiled like the
      rushes of a basket, composed a rare, if somewhat barbaric, example of
      ingenious art. One could understand such weavings and coilings being
      wrought to last intact for a year, or even a calendar month; but that they
      should be all demolished regularly at bedtime, after a single day of
      permanence, seemed a reckless waste of successful fabrication.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she had done it all herself, poor thing. She had no maid, and it was
      almost the only accomplishment she could boast of. Hence the unstinted
      pains.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a young invalid lady-not so very much of an invalid-sitting in a
      wheeled chair, which had been pulled up in the front part of a green
      enclosure, close to a bandstand, where a concert was going on, during a
      warm June afternoon. It had place in one of the minor parks or private
      gardens that are to be found in the suburbs of London, and was the effort
      of a local association to raise money for some charity. There are worlds
      within worlds in the great city, and though nobody outside the immediate
      district had ever heard of the charity, or the band, or the garden, the
      enclosure was filled with an interested audience sufficiently informed on
      all these.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the strains proceeded many of the listeners observed the chaired lady,
      whose back hair, by reason of her prominent position, so challenged
      inspection. Her face was not easily discernible, but the aforesaid cunning
      tress-weavings, the white ear and poll, and the curve of a cheek which was
      neither flaccid nor sallow, were signals that led to the expectation of
      good beauty in front. Such expectations are not infrequently disappointed
      as soon as the disclosure comes; and in the present case, when the lady,
      by a turn of the head, at length revealed herself, she was not so handsome
      as the people behind her had supposed, and even hoped-they did not know
      why.
    </p>
    <p>
      For one thing (alas! the commonness of this complaint), she was less young
      than they had fancied her to be. Yet attractive her face unquestionably
      was, and not at all sickly. The revelation of its details came each time
      she turned to talk to a boy of twelve or thirteen who stood beside her,
      and the shape of whose hat and jacket implied that he belonged to a
      well-known public school. The immediate bystanders could hear that he
      called her 'Mother.'
    </p>
    <p>
      When the end of the recital was reached, and the audience withdrew, many
      chose to find their way out by passing at her elbow. Almost all turned
      their heads to take a full and near look at the interesting woman, who
      remained stationary in the chair till the way should be clear enough for
      her to be wheeled out without obstruction. As if she expected their
      glances, and did not mind gratifying their curiosity, she met the eyes of
      several of her observers by lifting her own, showing these to be soft,
      brown, and affectionate orbs, a little plaintive in their regard.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was conducted out of the gardens, and passed along the pavement till
      she disappeared from view, the schoolboy walking beside her. To inquiries
      made by some persons who watched her away, the answer came that she was
      the second wife of the incumbent of a neighbouring parish, and that she
      was lame. She was generally believed to be a woman with a story-an
      innocent one, but a story of some sort or other.
    </p>
    <p>
      In conversing with her on their way home the boy who walked at her elbow
      said that he hoped his father had not missed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He have been so comfortable these last few hours that I am sure he cannot
      have missed us,' she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Has, dear mother-not have!' exclaimed the public-school boy, with an
      impatient fastidiousness that was almost harsh. 'Surely you know that by
      this time!'
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother hastily adopted the correction, and did not resent his making
      it, or retaliate, as she might well have done, by bidding him to wipe that
      crumby mouth of his, whose condition had been caused by surreptitious
      attempts to eat a piece of cake without taking it out of the pocket
      wherein it lay concealed. After this the pretty woman and the boy went
      onward in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      That question of grammar bore upon her history, and she fell into reverie,
      of a somewhat sad kind to all appearance. It might have been assumed that
      she was wondering if she had done wisely in shaping her life as she had
      shaped it, to bring out such a result as this.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a remote nook in North Wessex, forty miles from London, near the
      thriving county-town of Aldbrickham, there stood a pretty village with its
      church and parsonage, which she knew well enough, but her son had never
      seen. It was her native village, Gaymead, and the first event bearing upon
      her present situation had occurred at that place when she was only a girl
      of nineteen.
    </p>
    <p>
      How well she remembered it, that first act in her little tragi-comedy, the
      death of her reverend husband's first wife. It happened on a spring
      evening, and she who now and for many years had filled that first wife's
      place was then parlour-maid in the parson's house.
    </p>
    <p>
      When everything had been done that could be done, and the death was
      announced, she had gone out in the dusk to visit her parents, who were
      living in the same village, to tell them the sad news. As she opened the
      white swing-gate and looked towards the trees which rose westward,
      shutting out the pale light of the evening sky, she discerned, without
      much surprise, the figure of a man standing in the hedge, though she
      roguishly exclaimed as a matter of form, 'Oh, Sam, how you frightened me!'
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a young gardener of her acquaintance. She told him the particulars
      of the late event, and they stood silent, these two young people, in that
      elevated, calmly philosophic mind which is engendered when a tragedy has
      happened close at hand, and has not happened to the philosophers
      themselves. But it had its bearing upon their relations.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And will you stay on now at the Vicarage, just the same?' asked he.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had hardly thought of that. 'Oh, yes-I suppose!' she said. 'Everything
      will be just as usual, I imagine?'
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked beside her towards her mother's. Presently his arm stole round
      her waist. She gently removed it; but he placed it there again, and she
      yielded the point. 'You see, dear Sophy, you don't know that you'll stay
      on; you may want a home; and I shall be ready to offer one some day,
      though I may not be ready just yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, Sam, how can you be so fast! I've never even said I liked 'ee; and
      it is all your own doing, coming after me!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Still, it is nonsense to say I am not to have a try at you like the
      rest.' He stooped to kiss her a farewell, for they had reached her
      mother's door.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, Sam; you sha'n't!' she cried, putting her hand over his mouth. 'You
      ought to be more serious on such a night as this.' And she bade him adieu
      without allowing him to kiss her or to come indoors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vicar just left a widower was at this time a man about forty years of
      age, of good family, and childless. He had led a secluded existence in
      this college living, partly because there were no resident landowners; and
      his loss now intensified his habit of withdrawal from outward observation.
      He was still less seen than heretofore, kept himself still less in time
      with the rhythm and racket of the movements called progress in the world
      without. For many months after his wife's decease the economy of his
      household remained as before; the cook, the housemaid, the parlour-maid,
      and the man out-of-doors performed their duties or left them undone, just
      as Nature prompted them-the vicar knew not which. It was then represented
      to him that his servants seemed to have nothing to do in his small family
      of one. He was struck with the truth of this representation, and decided
      to cut down his establishment. But he was forestalled by Sophy, the
      parlour-maid, who said one evening that she wished to leave him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And why?' said the parson.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sam Hobson has asked me to marry him, sir.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well-do you want to marry?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not much. But it would be a home for me. And we have heard that one of us
      will have to leave.'
    </p>
    <p>
      A day or two after she said: 'I don't want to leave just yet, sir, if you
      don't wish it. Sam and I have quarrelled.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked up at her. He had hardly ever observed her before, though he had
      been frequently conscious of her soft presence in the room. What a
      kitten-like, flexuous, tender creature she was! She was the only one of
      the servants with whom he came into immediate and continuous relation.
      What should he do if Sophy were gone?
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy did not go, but one of the others did, and things went on quietly
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. Twycott, the vicar, was ill, Sophy brought up his meals to him,
      and she had no sooner left the room one day than he heard a noise on the
      stairs. She had slipped down with the tray, and so twisted her foot that
      she could not stand. The village surgeon was called in; the vicar got
      better, but Sophy was incapacitated for a long time; and she was informed
      that she must never again walk much or engage in any occupation which
      required her to stand long on her feet. As soon as she was comparatively
      well she spoke to him alone. Since she was forbidden to walk and bustle
      about, and, indeed, could not do so, it became her duty to leave. She
      could very well work at something sitting down, and she had an aunt a
      seamstress.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parson had been very greatly moved by what she had suffered on his
      account, and he exclaimed, 'No, Sophy; lame or not lame, I cannot let you
      go. You must never leave me again!'
    </p>
    <p>
      He came close to her, and, though she could never exactly tell how it
      happened, she became conscious of his lips upon her cheek. He then asked
      her to marry him. Sophy did not exactly love him, but she had a respect
      for him which almost amounted to veneration. Even if she had wished to get
      away from him she hardly dared refuse a personage so reverend and august
      in her eyes, and she assented forthwith to be his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus it happened that one fine morning, when the doors of the church were
      naturally open for ventilation, and the singing birds fluttered in and
      alighted on the tie-beams of the roof, there was a marriage-service at the
      communion-rails, which hardly a soul knew of. The parson and a
      neighbouring curate had entered at one door, and Sophy at another,
      followed by two necessary persons, whereupon in a short time there emerged
      a newly-made husband and wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Twycott knew perfectly well that he had committed social suicide by
      this step, despite Sophy's spotless character, and he had taken his
      measures accordingly. An exchange of livings had been arranged with an
      acquaintance who was incumbent of a church in the south of London, and as
      soon as possible the couple removed thither, abandoning their pretty
      country home, with trees and shrubs and glebe, for a narrow, dusty house
      in a long, straight street, and their fine peal of bells for the
      wretchedest one-tongued clangour that ever tortured mortal ears. It was
      all on her account. They were, however, away from every one who had known
      her former position; and also under less observation from without than
      they would have had to put up with in any country parish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy the woman was as charming a partner as a man could possess, though
      Sophy the lady had her deficiencies. She showed a natural aptitude for
      little domestic refinements, so far as related to things and manners; but
      in what is called culture she was less intuitive. She had now been married
      more than fourteen years, and her husband had taken much trouble with her
      education; but she still held confused ideas on the use of 'was' and
      'were,' which did not beget a respect for her among the few acquaintances
      she made. Her great grief in this relation was that her only child, on
      whose education no expense had been and would be spared, was now old
      enough to perceive these deficiencies in his mother, and not only to see
      them but to feel irritated at their existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus she lived on in the city, and wasted hours in braiding her beautiful
      hair, till her once apple cheeks waned to pink of the very faintest. Her
      foot had never regained its natural strength after the accident, and she
      was mostly obliged to avoid walking altogether. Her husband had grown to
      like London for its freedom and its domestic privacy; but he was twenty
      years his Sophy's senior, and had latterly been seized with a serious
      illness. On this day, however, he had seemed to be well enough to justify
      her accompanying her son Randolph to the concert.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next time we get a glimpse of her is when she appears in the mournful
      attire of a widow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Twycott had never rallied, and now lay in a well-packed cemetery to
      the south of the great city, where, if all the dead it contained had stood
      erect and alive, not one would have known him or recognized his name. The
      boy had dutifully followed him to the grave, and was now again at school.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout these changes Sophy had been treated like the child she was in
      nature though not in years. She was left with no control over anything
      that had been her husband's beyond her modest personal income. In his
      anxiety lest her inexperience should be overreached he had safeguarded
      with trustees all he possibly could. The completion of the boy's course at
      the public school, to be followed in due time by Oxford and ordination,
      had been all previsioned and arranged, and she really had nothing to
      occupy her in the world but to eat and drink, and make a business of
      indolence, and go on weaving and coiling the nut-brown hair, merely
      keeping a home open for the son whenever he came to her during vacations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foreseeing his probable decease long years before her, her husband in his
      lifetime had purchased for her use a semi-detached villa in the same long,
      straight road whereon the church and parsonage faced, which was to be hers
      as long as she chose to live in it. Here she now resided, looking out upon
      the fragment of lawn in front, and through the railings at the
      ever-flowing traffic; or, bending forward over the window-sill on the
      first floor, stretching her eyes far up and down the vista of sooty trees,
      hazy air, and drab house-facades, along which echoed the noises common to
      a suburban main thoroughfare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somehow, her boy, with his aristocratic school-knowledge, his grammars,
      and his aversions, was losing those wide infantine sympathies, extending
      as far as to the sun and moon themselves, with which he, like other
      children, had been born, and which his mother, a child of nature herself,
      had loved in him; he was reducing their compass to a population of a few
      thousand wealthy and titled people, the mere veneer of a thousand million
      or so of others who did not interest him at all. He drifted further and
      further away from her. Sophy's milieu being a suburb of minor tradesmen
      and under-clerks, and her almost only companions the two servants of her
      own house, it was not surprising that after her husband's death she soon
      lost the little artificial tastes she had acquired from him, and became-in
      her son's eyes-a mother whose mistakes and origin it was his painful lot
      as a gentleman to blush for. As yet he was far from being man enough-if he
      ever would be-to rate these sins of hers at their true infinitesimal value
      beside the yearning fondness that welled up and remained penned in her
      heart till it should be more fully accepted by him, or by some other
      person or thing. If he had lived at home with her he would have had all of
      it; but he seemed to require so very little in present circumstances, and
      it remained stored.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her life became insupportably dreary; she could not take walks, and had no
      interest in going for drives, or, indeed, in travelling anywhere. Nearly
      two years passed without an event, and still she looked on that suburban
      road, thinking of the village in which she had been born, and whither she
      would have gone back-O how gladly!-even to work in the fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking no exercise, she often could not sleep, and would rise in the night
      or early morning and look out upon the then vacant thoroughfare, where the
      lamps stood like sentinels waiting for some procession to go by. An
      approximation to such a procession was indeed made early every morning
      about one o'clock, when the country vehicles passed up with loads of
      vegetables for Covent Garden market. She often saw them creeping along at
      this silent and dusky hour-waggon after waggon, bearing green bastions of
      cabbages nodding to their fall, yet never falling, walls of baskets
      enclosing masses of beans and peas, pyramids of snow-white turnips,
      swaying howdahs of mixed produce-creeping along behind aged night-horses,
      who seemed ever patiently wondering between their hollow coughs why they
      had always to work at that still hour when all other sentient creatures
      were privileged to rest. Wrapped in a cloak, it was soothing to watch and
      sympathize with them when depression and nervousness hindered sleep, and
      to see how the fresh green-stuff brightened to life as it came opposite
      the lamp, and how the sweating animals steamed and shone with their miles
      of travel.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had an interest, almost a charm, for Sophy, these semirural people
      and vehicles moving in an urban atmosphere, leading a life quite distinct
      from that of the daytime toilers on the same road. One morning a man who
      accompanied a waggon-load of potatoes gazed rather hard at the
      house-fronts as he passed, and with a curious emotion she thought his form
      was familiar to her. She looked out for him again. His being an
      old-fashioned conveyance, with a yellow front, it was easily recognizable,
      and on the third night after she saw it a second time. The man alongside
      was, as she had fancied, Sam Hobson, formerly gardener at Gaymead, who
      would at one time have married her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had occasionally thought of him, and wondered if life in a cottage
      with him would not have been a happier lot than the life she had accepted.
      She had not thought of him passionately, but her now dismal situation lent
      an interest to his resurrection-a tender interest which it is impossible
      to exaggerate. She went back to bed, and began thinking. When did these
      market-gardeners, who travelled up to town so regularly at one or two in
      the morning, come back? She dimly recollected seeing their empty waggons,
      hardly noticeable amid the ordinary day-traffic, passing down at some hour
      before noon.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only April, but that morning, after breakfast, she had the window
      opened, and sat looking out, the feeble sun shining full upon her. She
      affected to sew, but her eyes never left the street. Between ten and
      eleven the desired waggon, now unladen, reappeared on its return journey.
      But Sam was not looking round him then, and drove on in a reverie.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sam!' cried she.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning with a start, his face lighted up. He called to him a little boy
      to hold the horse, alighted, and came and stood under her window.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I can't come down easily, Sam, or I would!' she said. 'Did you know I
      lived here?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, Mrs. Twycott, I knew you lived along here somewhere. I have often
      looked out for 'ee.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He briefly explained his own presence on the scene. He had long since
      given up his gardening in the village near Aldbrickham, and was now
      manager at a market-gardener's on the south side of London, it being part
      of his duty to go up to Covent Garden with waggon-loads of produce two or
      three times a week. In answer to her curious inquiry, he admitted that he
      had come to this particular district because he had seen in the
      Aldbrickham paper, a year or two before, the announcement of the death in
      South London of the aforetime vicar of Gaymead, which had revived an
      interest in her dwelling-place that he could not extinguish, leading him
      to hover about the locality till his present post had been secured.
    </p>
    <p>
      They spoke of their native village in dear old North Wessex, the spots in
      which they had played together as children. She tried to feel that she was
      a dignified personage now, that she must not be too confidential with Sam.
      But she could not keep it up, and the tears hanging in her eyes were
      indicated in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are not happy, Mrs. Twycott, I'm afraid?' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, of course not! I lost my husband only the year before last.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah! I meant in another way. You'd like to be home again?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'This is my home-for life. The house belongs to me. But I understand'-She
      let it out then. 'Yes, Sam. I long for home-our home! I should like to be
      there, and never leave it, and die there.' But she remembered herself.
      'That's only a momentary feeling. I have a son, you know, a dear boy. He's
      at school now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Somewhere handy, I suppose? I see there's lots on 'em along this road.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no! Not in one of these wretched holes! At a public school-one of the
      most distinguished in England.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Chok' it all! of course! I forget, ma'am, that you've been a lady for so
      many years.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, I am not a lady,' she said sadly. 'I never shall be. But he's a
      gentleman, and that-makes it-O how difficult for me!'

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <p>
      The acquaintance thus oddly reopened proceeded apace. She often looked out
      to get a few words with him, by night or by day. Her sorrow was that she
      could not accompany her one old friend on foot a little way, and talk more
      freely than she could do while he paused before the house. One night, at
      the beginning of June, when she was again on the watch after an absence of
      some days from the window, he entered the gate and said softly, 'Now,
      wouldn't some air do you good? I've only half a load this morning. Why not
      ride up to Covent Garden with me? There's a nice seat on the cabbages,
      where I've spread a sack. You can be home again in a cab before anybody is
      up.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She refused at first, and then, trembling with excitement, hastily
      finished her dressing, and wrapped herself up in cloak and veil,
      afterwards sidling downstairs by the aid of the handrail, in a way she
      could adopt on an emergency. When she had opened the door she found Sam on
      the step, and he lifted her bodily on his strong arm across the little
      forecourt into his vehicle. Not a soul was visible or audible in the
      infinite length of the straight, flat highway, with its ever-waiting lamps
      converging to points in each direction. The air was fresh as country air
      at this hour, and the stars shone, except to the north- eastward, where
      there was a whitish light-the dawn. Sam carefully placed her in the seat,
      and drove on.
    </p>
    <p>
      They talked as they had talked in old days, Sam pulling himself up now and
      then, when he thought himself too familiar. More than once she said with
      misgiving that she wondered if she ought to have indulged in the freak.
      'But I am so lonely in my house,' she added, 'and this makes me so happy!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You must come again, dear Mrs. Twycott. There is no time o' day for
      taking the air like this.'
    </p>
    <p>
      It grew lighter and lighter. The sparrows became busy in the streets, and
      the city waxed denser around them. When they approached the river it was
      day, and on the bridge they beheld the full blaze of morning sunlight in
      the direction of St. Paul's, the river glistening towards it, and not a
      craft stirring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Near Covent Garden he put her into a cab, and they parted, looking into
      each other's faces like the very old friends they were. She reached home
      without adventure, limped to the door, and let herself in with her
      latch-key unseen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The air and Sam's presence had revived her: her cheeks were quite
      pink-almost beautiful. She had something to live for in addition to her
      son. A woman of pure instincts, she knew there had been nothing really
      wrong in the journey, but supposed it conventionally to be very wrong
      indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon, however, she gave way to the temptation of going with him again, and
      on this occasion their conversation was distinctly tender, and Sam said he
      never should forget her, notwithstanding that she had served him rather
      badly at one time. After much hesitation he told her of a plan it was in
      his power to carry out, and one he should like to take in hand, since he
      did not care for London work: it was to set up as a master greengrocer
      down at Aldbrickham, the county-town of their native place. He knew of an
      opening-a shop kept by aged people who wished to retire.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And why don't you do it, then, Sam?' she asked with a slight
      heartsinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Because I'm not sure if-you'd join me. I know you wouldn't-couldn't! Such
      a lady as ye've been so long, you couldn't be a wife to a man like me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I hardly suppose I could!' she assented, also frightened at the idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      'If you could,' he said eagerly, 'you'd on'y have to sit in the back
      parlour and look through the glass partition when I was away
      sometimes-just to keep an eye on things. The lameness wouldn't hinder that
      . . . I'd keep you as genteel as ever I could, dear Sophy-if I might think
      of it!' he pleaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sam, I'll be frank,' she said, putting her hand on his. 'If it were only
      myself I would do it, and gladly, though everything I possess would be
      lost to me by marrying again.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't mind that! It's more independent.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's good of you, dear, dear Sam. But there's something else. I have a
      son . . . I almost fancy when I am miserable sometimes that he is not
      really mine, but one I hold in trust for my late husband. He seems to
      belong so little to me personally, so entirely to his dead father. He is
      so much educated and I so little that I do not feel dignified enough to be
      his mother . . . Well, he would have to be told.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. Unquestionably.' Sam saw her thought and her fear. 'Still, you can
      do as you like, Sophy-Mrs. Twycott,' he added. 'It is not you who are the
      child, but he.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, you don't know! Sam, if I could, I would marry you, some day. But you
      must wait a while, and let me think.'
    </p>
    <p>
      It was enough for him, and he was blithe at their parting. Not so she. To
      tell Randolph seemed impossible. She could wait till he had gone up to
      Oxford, when what she did would affect his life but little. But would he
      ever tolerate the idea? And if not, could she defy him?
    </p>
    <p>
      She had not told him a word when the yearly cricket-match came on at
      Lord's between the public schools, though Sam had already gone back to
      Aldbrickham. Mrs. Twycott felt stronger than usual: she went to the match
      with Randolph, and was able to leave her chair and walk about
      occasionally. The bright idea occurred to her that she could casually
      broach the subject while moving round among the spectators, when the boy's
      spirits were high with interest in the game, and he would weigh domestic
      matters as feathers in the scale beside the day's victory. They promenaded
      under the lurid July sun, this pair, so wide apart, yet so near, and Sophy
      saw the large proportion of boys like her own, in their broad white
      collars and dwarf hats, and all around the rows of great coaches under
      which was jumbled the debris of luxurious luncheons; bones, pie-crusts,
      champagne-bottles, glasses, plates, napkins, and the family silver; while
      on the coaches sat the proud fathers and mothers; but never a poor mother
      like her. If Randolph had not appertained to these, had not centred all
      his interests in them, had not cared exclusively for the class they
      belonged to, how happy would things have been! A great huzza at some small
      performance with the bat burst from the multitude of relatives, and
      Randolph jumped wildly into the air to see what had happened. Sophy
      fetched up the sentence that had been already shaped; but she could not
      get it out. The occasion was, perhaps, an inopportune one. The contrast
      between her story and the display of fashion to which Randolph had grown
      to regard himself as akin would be fatal. She awaited a better time.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on an evening when they were alone in their plain suburban
      residence, where life was not blue but brown, that she ultimately broke
      silence, qualifying her announcement of a probable second marriage by
      assuring him that it would not take place for a long time to come, when he
      would be living quite independently of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy thought the idea a very reasonable one, and asked if she had
      chosen anybody? She hesitated; and he seemed to have a misgiving. He hoped
      his stepfather would be a gentleman? he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not what you call a gentleman,' she answered timidly. 'He'll be much as I
      was before I knew your father;' and by degrees she acquainted him with the
      whole. The youth's face remained fixed for a moment; then he flushed,
      leant on the table, and burst into passionate tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother went up to him, kissed all of his face that she could get at,
      and patted his back as if he were still the baby he once had been, crying
      herself the while. When he had somewhat recovered from his paroxysm he
      went hastily to his own room and fastened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parleyings were attempted through the keyhole, outside which she waited
      and listened. It was long before he would reply, and when he did it was to
      say sternly at her from within: 'I am ashamed of you! It will ruin me! A
      miserable boor! a churl! a clown! It will degrade me in the eyes of all
      the gentlemen of England!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Say no more-perhaps I am wrong! I will struggle against it!' she cried
      miserably.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Randolph left her that summer a letter arrived from Sam to inform
      her that he had been unexpectedly fortunate in obtaining the shop. He was
      in possession; it was the largest in the town, combining fruit with
      vegetables, and he thought it would form a home worthy even of her some
      day. Might he not run up to town to see her?
    </p>
    <p>
      She met him by stealth, and said he must still wait for her final answer.
      The autumn dragged on, and when Randolph was home at Christmas for the
      holidays she broached the matter again. But the young gentleman was
      inexorable.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was dropped for months; renewed again; abandoned under his repugnance;
      again attempted; and thus the gentle creature reasoned and pleaded till
      four or five long years had passed. Then the faithful Sam revived his suit
      with some peremptoriness. Sophy's son, now an undergraduate, was down from
      Oxford one Easter, when she again opened the subject. As soon as he was
      ordained, she argued, he would have a home of his own, wherein she, with
      her bad grammar and her ignorance, would be an encumbrance to him. Better
      obliterate her as much as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      He showed a more manly anger now, but would not agree. She on her side was
      more persistent, and he had doubts whether she could be trusted in his
      absence. But by indignation and contempt for her taste he completely
      maintained his ascendency; and finally taking her before a little cross
      and altar that he had erected in his bedroom for his private devotions,
      there bade her kneel, and swear that she would not wed Samuel Hobson
      without his consent. 'I owe this to my father!' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor woman swore, thinking he would soften as soon as he was ordained
      and in full swing of clerical work. But he did not. His education had by
      this time sufficiently ousted his humanity to keep him quite firm; though
      his mother might have led an idyllic life with her faithful fruiterer and
      greengrocer, and nobody have been anything the worse in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her lameness became more confirmed as time went on, and she seldom or
      never left the house in the long southern thoroughfare, where she seemed
      to be pining her heart away. 'Why mayn't I say to Sam that I'll marry him?
      Why mayn't I?' she would murmur plaintively to herself when nobody was
      near.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some four years after this date a middle-aged man was standing at the door
      of the largest fruiterer's shop in Aldbrickham. He was the proprietor, but
      to-day, instead of his usual business attire, he wore a neat suit of
      black; and his window was partly shuttered. From the railway-station a
      funeral procession was seen approaching: it passed his door and went out
      of the town towards the village of Gaymead. The man, whose eyes were wet,
      held his hat in his hand as the vehicles moved by; while from the mourning
      coach a young smooth-shaven priest in a high waistcoat looked black as a
      cloud at the shop keeper standing there.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <p>
      Whether the utilitarian or the intuitive theory of the moral sense be
      upheld, it is beyond question that there are a few subtle-souled persons
      with whom the absolute gratuitousness of an act of reparation is an
      inducement to perform it; while exhortation as to its necessity would
      breed excuses for leaving it undone. The case of Mr. Millborne and Mrs.
      Frankland particularly illustrated this, and perhaps something more.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were few figures better known to the local crossing-sweeper than Mr.
      Millborne's, in his daily comings and goings along a familiar and quiet
      London street, where he lived inside the door marked eleven, though not as
      householder. In age he was fifty at least, and his habits were as regular
      as those of a person can be who has no occupation but the study of how to
      keep himself employed. He turned almost always to the right on getting to
      the end of his street, then he went onward down Bond Street to his club,
      whence he returned by precisely the same course about six o'clock, on
      foot; or, if he went to dine, later on in a cab. He was known to be a man
      of some means, though apparently not wealthy. Being a bachelor he seemed
      to prefer his present mode of living as a lodger in Mrs. Towney's best
      rooms, with the use of furniture which he had bought ten times over in
      rent during his tenancy, to having a house of his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      None among his acquaintance tried to know him well, for his manner and
      moods did not excite curiosity or deep friendship. He was not a man who
      seemed to have anything on his mind, anything to conceal, anything to
      impart. From his casual remarks it was generally understood that he was
      country-born, a native of some place in Wessex; that he had come to London
      as a young man in a banking-house, and had risen to a post of
      responsibility; when, by the death of his father, who had been fortunate
      in his investments, the son succeeded to an income which led him to retire
      from a business life somewhat early.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening, when he had been unwell for several days, Doctor Bindon came
      in, after dinner, from the adjoining medical quarter, and smoked with him
      over the fire. The patient's ailment was not such as to require much
      thought, and they talked together on indifferent subjects.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am a lonely man, Bindon-a lonely man,' Millborne took occasion to say,
      shaking his head gloomily. 'You don't know such loneliness as mine . . .
      And the older I get the more I am dissatisfied with myself. And to-day I
      have been, through an accident, more than usually haunted by what, above
      all other events of my life, causes that dissatisfaction-the recollection
      of an unfulfilled promise made twenty years ago. In ordinary affairs I
      have always been considered a man of my word and perhaps it is on that
      account that a particular vow I once made, and did not keep, comes back to
      me with a magnitude out of all proportion (I daresay) to its real gravity,
      especially at this time of day. You know the discomfort caused at night by
      the half-sleeping sense that a door or window has been left unfastened, or
      in the day by the remembrance of unanswered letters. So does that promise
      haunt me from time to time, and has done to-day particularly.'
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause, and they smoked on. Millborne's eyes, though fixed on
      the fire, were really regarding attentively a town in the West of England.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' he continued, 'I have never quite forgotten it, though during the
      busy years of my life it was shelved and buried under the pressure of my
      pursuits. And, as I say, to-day in particular, an incident in the law-
      report of a somewhat similar kind has brought it back again vividly.
      However, what it was I can tell you in a few words, though no doubt you,
      as a man of the world, will smile at the thinness of my skin when you hear
      it . . . I came up to town at one-and-twenty, from Toneborough, in Outer
      Wessex, where I was born, and where, before I left, I had won the heart of
      a young woman of my own age. I promised her marriage, took advantage of my
      promise, and-am a bachelor.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The old story.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The other nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I left the place, and thought at the time I had done a very clever thing
      in getting so easily out of an entanglement. But I have lived long enough
      for that promise to return to bother me-to be honest, not altogether as a
      pricking of the conscience, but as a dissatisfaction with myself as a
      specimen of the heap of flesh called humanity. If I were to ask you to
      lend me fifty pounds, which I would repay you next midsummer, and I did
      not repay you, I should consider myself a shabby sort of fellow,
      especially if you wanted the money badly. Yet I promised that girl just as
      distinctly; and then coolly broke my word, as if doing so were rather
      smart conduct than a mean action, for which the poor victim herself,
      encumbered with a child, and not I, had really to pay the penalty, in
      spite of certain pecuniary aid that was given. There, that's the
      retrospective trouble that I am always unearthing; and you may hardly
      believe that though so many years have elapsed, and it is all gone by and
      done with, and she must be getting on for an old woman now, as I am for an
      old man, it really often destroys my sense of self- respect still.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, I can understand it. All depends upon the temperament. Thousands of
      men would have forgotten all about it; so would you, perhaps, if you had
      married and had a family. Did she ever marry?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't think so. O no-she never did. She left Toneborough, and later on
      appeared under another name at Exonbury, in the next county, where she was
      not known. It is very seldom that I go down into that part of the country,
      but in passing through Exonbury, on one occasion, I learnt that she was
      quite a settled resident there, as a teacher of music, or something of the
      kind. That much I casually heard when I was there two or three years ago.
      But I have never set eyes on her since our original acquaintance, and
      should not know her if I met her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Did the child live?' asked the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      'For several years, certainly,' replied his friend. 'I cannot say if she
      is living now. It was a little girl. She might be married by this time as
      far as years go.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And the mother-was she a decent, worthy young woman?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O yes; a sensible, quiet girl, neither attractive nor unattractive to the
      ordinary observer; simply commonplace. Her position at the time of our
      acquaintance was not so good as mine. My father was a solicitor, as I
      think I have told you. She was a young girl in a music-shop; and it was
      represented to me that it would be beneath my position to marry her. Hence
      the result.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, all I can say is that after twenty years it is probably too late to
      think of mending such a matter. It has doubtless by this time mended
      itself. You had better dismiss it from your mind as an evil past your
      control. Of course, if mother and daughter are alive, or either, you might
      settle something upon them, if you were inclined, and had it to spare.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I haven't much to spare; and I have relations in narrow
      circumstances-perhaps narrower than theirs. But that is not the point.
      Were I ever so rich I feel I could not rectify the past by money. I did
      not promise to enrich her. On the contrary, I told her it would probably
      be dire poverty for both of us. But I did promise to make her my wife.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then find her and do it,' said the doctor jocularly as he rose to leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, Bindon. That, of course, is the obvious jest. But I haven't the
      slightest desire for marriage; I am quite content to live as I have lived.
      I am a bachelor by nature, and instinct, and habit, and everything.
      Besides, though I respect her still (for she was not an atom to blame), I
      haven't any shadow of love for her. In my mind she exists as one of those
      women you think well of, but find uninteresting. It would be purely with
      the idea of putting wrong right that I should hunt her up, and propose to
      do it off-hand.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You don't think of it seriously?' said his surprised friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I sometimes think that I would, if it were practicable; simply, as I say,
      to recover my sense of being a man of honour.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I wish you luck in the enterprise,' said Doctor Bindon. 'You'll soon be
      out of that chair, and then you can put your impulse to the test.
      But-after twenty years of silence-I should say, don't!'

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <p>
      The doctor's advice remained counterpoised, in Millborne's mind, by the
      aforesaid mood of seriousness and sense of principle, approximating often
      to religious sentiment, which had been evolving itself in his breast for
      months, and even years.
    </p>
    <p>
      The feeling, however, had no immediate effect upon Mr. Millborne's
      actions. He soon got over his trifling illness, and was vexed with himself
      for having, in a moment of impulse, confided such a case of conscience to
      anybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the force which had prompted it, though latent, remained with him and
      ultimately grew stronger. The upshot was that about four months after the
      date of his illness and disclosure, Millborne found himself on a mild
      spring morning at Paddington Station, in a train that was starting for the
      west. His many intermittent thoughts on his broken promise from time to
      time, in those hours when loneliness brought him face to face with his own
      personality, had at last resulted in this course.
    </p>
    <p>
      The decisive stimulus had been given when, a day or two earlier, on
      looking into a Post-Office Directory, he learnt that the woman he had not
      met for twenty years was still living on at Exonbury under the name she
      had assumed when, a year or two after her disappearance from her native
      town and his, she had returned from abroad as a young widow with a child,
      and taken up her residence at the former city. Her condition was
      apparently but little changed, and her daughter seemed to be with her,
      their names standing in the Directory as 'Mrs. Leonora Frankland and Miss
      Frankland, Teachers of Music and Dancing.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Millborne reached Exonbury in the afternoon, and his first business,
      before even taking his luggage into the town, was to find the house
      occupied by the teachers. Standing in a central and open place it was not
      difficult to discover, a well-burnished brass doorplate bearing their
      names prominently. He hesitated to enter without further knowledge, and
      ultimately took lodgings over a toyshop opposite, securing a sitting-room
      which faced a similar drawing or sitting-room at the Franklands', where
      the dancing lessons were given. Installed here he was enabled to make
      indirectly, and without suspicion, inquiries and observations on the
      character of the ladies over the way, which he did with much
      deliberateness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He learnt that the widow, Mrs. Frankland, with her one daughter, Frances,
      was of cheerful and excellent repute, energetic and painstaking with her
      pupils, of whom she had a good many, and in whose tuition her daughter
      assisted her. She was quite a recognized townswoman, and though the
      dancing branch of her profession was perhaps a trifle worldly, she was
      really a serious-minded lady who, being obliged to live by what she knew
      how to teach, balanced matters by lending a hand at charitable bazaars,
      assisting at sacred concerts, and giving musical recitations in aid of
      funds for bewildering happy savages, and other such enthusiasms of this
      enlightened country. Her daughter was one of the foremost of the bevy of
      young women who decorated the churches at Easter and Christmas, was
      organist in one of those edifices, and had subscribed to the testimonial
      of a silver broth-basin that was presented to the Reverend Mr. Walker as a
      token of gratitude for his faithful and arduous intonations of six months
      as sub-precentor in the Cathedral. Altogether mother and daughter appeared
      to be a typical and innocent pair among the genteel citizens of Exonbury.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a natural and simple way of advertising their profession they allowed
      the windows of the music-room to be a little open, so that you had the
      pleasure of hearing all along the street at any hour between sunrise and
      sunset fragmentary gems of classical music as interpreted by the young
      people of twelve or fourteen who took lessons there. But it was said that
      Mrs. Frankland made most of her income by letting out pianos on hire, and
      by selling them as agent for the makers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The report pleased Millborne; it was highly creditable, and far better
      than he had hoped. He was curious to get a view of the two women who led
      such blameless lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not long to wait to gain a glimpse of Leonora. It was when she was
      standing on her own doorstep, opening her parasol, on the morning after
      his arrival. She was thin, though not gaunt; and a good, well- wearing,
      thoughtful face had taken the place of the one which had temporarily
      attracted him in the days of his nonage. She wore black, and it became her
      in her character of widow. The daughter next appeared; she was a smoothed
      and rounded copy of her mother, with the same decision in her mien that
      Leonora had, and a bounding gait in which he traced a faint resemblance to
      his own at her age.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first time he absolutely made up his mind to call on them. But his
      antecedent step was to send Leonora a note the next morning, stating his
      proposal to visit her, and suggesting the evening as the time, because she
      seemed to be so greatly occupied in her professional capacity during the
      day. He purposely worded his note in such a form as not to require an
      answer from her which would be possibly awkward to write.
    </p>
    <p>
      No answer came. Naturally he should not have been surprised at this; and
      yet he felt a little checked, even though she had only refrained from
      volunteering a reply that was not demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      At eight, the hour fixed by himself, he crossed over and was passively
      admitted by the servant. Mrs. Frankland, as she called herself, received
      him in the large music-and-dancing room on the first-floor front, and not
      in any private little parlour as he had expected. This cast a
      distressingly business-like colour over their first meeting after so many
      years of severance. The woman he had wronged stood before him,
      well-dressed, even to his metropolitan eyes, and her manner as she came up
      to him was dignified even to hardness. She certainly was not glad to see
      him. But what could he expect after a neglect of twenty years!
    </p>
    <p>
      'How do you do, Mr. Millborne?' she said cheerfully, as to any chance
      caller. 'I am obliged to receive you here because my daughter has a friend
      downstairs.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Your daughter-and mine.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah-yes, yes,' she replied hastily, as if the addition had escaped her
      memory. 'But perhaps the less said about that the better, in fairness to
      me. You will consider me a widow, please.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Certainly, Leonora . . . ' He could not get on, her manner was so cold
      and indifferent. The expected scene of sad reproach, subdued to delicacy
      by the run of years, was absent altogether. He was obliged to come to the
      point without preamble.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are quite free, Leonora-I mean as to marriage? There is nobody who
      has your promise, or-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O yes; quite free, Mr. Millborne,' she said, somewhat surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then I will tell you why I have come. Twenty years ago I promised to make
      you my wife; and I am here to fulfil that promise. Heaven forgive my
      tardiness!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Her surprise was increased, but she was not agitated. She seemed to become
      gloomy, disapproving. 'I could not entertain such an idea at this time of
      life,' she said after a moment or two. 'It would complicate matters too
      greatly. I have a very fair income, and require no help of any sort. I
      have no wish to marry . . . What could have induced you to come on such an
      errand now? It seems quite extraordinary, if I may say so!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It must-I daresay it does,' Millborne replied vaguely; 'and I must tell
      you that impulse-I mean in the sense of passion-has little to do with it.
      I wish to marry you, Leonora; I much desire to marry you. But it is an
      affair of conscience, a case of fulfilment. I promised you, and it was
      dishonourable of me to go away. I want to remove that sense of dishonour
      before I die. No doubt we might get to love each other as warmly as we did
      in old times?'
    </p>
    <p>
      She dubiously shook her head. 'I appreciate your motives, Mr. Millborne;
      but you must consider my position; and you will see that, short of the
      personal wish to marry, which I don't feel, there is no reason why I
      should change my state, even though by so doing I should ease your
      conscience. My position in this town is a respected one; I have built it
      up by my own hard labours, and, in short, I don't wish to alter it. My
      daughter, too, is just on the verge of an engagement to be married, to a
      young man who will make her an excellent husband. It will be in every way
      a desirable match for her. He is downstairs now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Does she know-anything about me?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no, no; God forbid! Her father is dead and buried to her. So that, you
      see, things are going on smoothly, and I don't want to disturb their
      progress.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded. 'Very well,' he said, and rose to go. At the door, however, he
      came back again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Still, Leonora,' he urged, 'I have come on purpose; and I don't see what
      disturbance would be caused. You would simply marry an old friend. Won't
      you reconsider? It is no more than right that we should be united,
      remembering the girl.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head, and patted with her foot nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I won't detain you,' he added. 'I shall not be leaving Exonbury
      yet. You will allow me to see you again?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes; I don't mind,' she said reluctantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The obstacles he had encountered, though they did not reanimate his dead
      passion for Leonora, did certainly make it appear indispensable to his
      peace of mind to overcome her coldness. He called frequently. The first
      meeting with the daughter was a trying ordeal, though he did not feel
      drawn towards her as he had expected to be; she did not excite his
      sympathies. Her mother confided to Frances the errand of 'her old friend,'
      which was viewed by the daughter with strong disfavour. His desire being
      thus uncongenial to both, for a long time Millborne made not the least
      impression upon Mrs. Frankland. His attentions pestered her rather than
      pleased her. He was surprised at her firmness, and it was only when he
      hinted at moral reasons for their union that she was ever shaken.
      'Strictly speaking,' he would say, 'we ought, as honest persons, to marry;
      and that's the truth of it, Leonora.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have looked at it in that light,' she said quickly. 'It struck me at
      the very first. But I don't see the force of the argument. I totally deny
      that after this interval of time I am bound to marry you for honour's
      sake. I would have married you, as you know well enough, at the proper
      time. But what is the use of remedies now?'
    </p>
    <p>
      They were standing at the window. A scantly-whiskered young man, in
      clerical attire, called at the door below. Leonora flushed with interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who is he?' said Mr. Millborne.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My Frances's lover. I am so sorry-she is not at home! Ah! they have told
      him where she is, and he has gone to find her . . . I hope that suit will
      prosper, at any rate!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why shouldn't it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, he cannot marry yet; and Frances sees but little of him now he has
      left Exonbury. He was formerly doing duty here, but now he is curate of
      St. John's, Ivell, fifty miles up the line. There is a tacit agreement
      between them, but-there have been friends of his who object, because of
      our vocation. However, he sees the absurdity of such an objection as that,
      and is not influenced by it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Your marriage with me would help the match, instead of hindering it, as
      you have said.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you think it would?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It certainly would, by taking you out of this business altogether.'
    </p>
    <p>
      By chance he had found the way to move her somewhat, and he followed it
      up. This view was imparted to Mrs. Frankland's daughter, and it led her to
      soften her opposition. Millborne, who had given up his lodging in
      Exonbury, journeyed to and fro regularly, till at last he overcame her
      negations, and she expressed a reluctant assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were married at the nearest church; and the goodwill-whatever that
      was-of the music-and-dancing connection was sold to a successor only too
      ready to jump into the place, the Millbornes having decided to live in
      London.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <p>
      Millborne was a householder in his old district, though not in his old
      street, and Mrs. Millborne and their daughter had turned themselves into
      Londoners. Frances was well reconciled to the removal by her lover's
      satisfaction at the change. It suited him better to travel from Ivell a
      hundred miles to see her in London, where he frequently had other
      engagements, than fifty in the opposite direction where nothing but
      herself required his presence. So here they were, furnished up to the
      attics, in one of the small but popular streets of the West district, in a
      house whose front, till lately of the complexion of a chimney-sweep, had
      been scraped to show to the surprised wayfarer the bright yellow and red
      brick that had lain lurking beneath the soot of fifty years.
    </p>
    <p>
      The social lift that the two women had derived from the alliance was
      considerable; but when the exhilaration which accompanies a first
      residence in London, the sensation of standing on a pivot of the world,
      had passed, their lives promised to be somewhat duller than when, at
      despised Exonbury, they had enjoyed a nodding acquaintance with three-
      fourths of the town. Mr. Millborne did not criticise his wife; he could
      not. Whatever defects of hardness and acidity his original treatment and
      the lapse of years might have developed in her, his sense of a realized
      idea, of a re-established self-satisfaction, was always thrown into the
      scale on her side, and out-weighed all objections.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was about a month after their settlement in town that the household
      decided to spend a week at a watering-place in the Isle of Wight, and
      while there the Reverend Percival Cope (the young curate aforesaid) came
      to see them, Frances in particular. No formal engagement of the young pair
      had been announced as yet, but it was clear that their mutual
      understanding could not end in anything but marriage without grievous
      disappointment to one of the parties at least. Not that Frances was
      sentimental. She was rather of the imperious sort, indeed; and, to say
      all, the young girl had not fulfilled her father's expectations of her.
      But he hoped and worked for her welfare as sincerely as any father could
      do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cope was introduced to the new head of the family, and stayed with
      them in the Island two or three days. On the last day of his visit they
      decided to venture on a two hours' sail in one of the small yachts which
      lay there for hire. The trip had not progressed far before all, except the
      curate, found that sailing in a breeze did not quite agree with them; but
      as he seemed to enjoy the experience, the other three bore their condition
      as well as they could without grimace or complaint, till the young man,
      observing their discomfort, gave immediate directions to tack about. On
      the way back to port they sat silent, facing each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nausea in such circumstances, like midnight watching, fatigue, trouble,
      fright, has this marked effect upon the countenance, that it often brings
      out strongly the divergences of the individual from the norm of his race,
      accentuating superficial peculiarities to radical distinctions. Unexpected
      physiognomies will uncover themselves at these times in well-known faces;
      the aspect becomes invested with the spectral presence of entombed and
      forgotten ancestors; and family lineaments of special or exclusive cast,
      which in ordinary moments are masked by a stereotyped expression and mien,
      start up with crude insistence to the view.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frances, sitting beside her mother's husband, with Mr. Cope opposite, was
      naturally enough much regarded by the curate during the tedious sail home;
      at first with sympathetic smiles. Then, as the middle-aged father and his
      child grew each gray-faced, as the pretty blush of Frances disintegrated
      into spotty stains, and the soft rotundities of her features diverged from
      their familiar and reposeful beauty into elemental lines, Cope was
      gradually struck with the resemblance between a pair in their discomfort
      who in their ease presented nothing to the eye in common. Mr. Millborne
      and Frances in their indisposition were strangely, startlingly alike.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inexplicable fact absorbed Cope's attention quite. He forgot to smile
      at Frances, to hold her hand; and when they touched the shore he remained
      sitting for some moments like a man in a trance.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they went homeward, and recovered their complexions and contours, the
      similarities one by one disappeared, and Frances and Mr. Millborne were
      again masked by the commonplace differences of sex and age. It was as if,
      during the voyage, a mysterious veil had been lifted, temporarily
      revealing a strange pantomime of the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the evening he said to her casually: 'Is your step-father a cousin
      of your mother, dear Frances?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, no,' said she. 'There is no relationship. He was only an old friend
      of hers. Why did you suppose such a thing?'
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not explain, and the next morning started to resume his duties at
      Ivell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cope was an honest young fellow, and shrewd withal. At home in his quiet
      rooms in St. Peter's Street, Ivell, he pondered long and unpleasantly on
      the revelations of the cruise. The tale it told was distinct enough, and
      for the first time his position was an uncomfortable one. He had met the
      Franklands at Exonbury as parishioners, had been attracted by Frances, and
      had floated thus far into an engagement which was indefinite only because
      of his inability to marry just yet. The Franklands' past had apparently
      contained mysteries, and it did not coincide with his judgment to marry
      into a family whose mystery was of the sort suggested. So he sat and
      sighed, between his reluctance to lose Frances and his natural dislike of
      forming a connection with people whose antecedents would not bear the
      strictest investigation.
    </p>
    <p>
      A passionate lover of the old-fashioned sort might possibly never have
      halted to weigh these doubts; but though he was in the church Cope's
      affections were fastidious-distinctly tempered with the alloys of the
      century's decadence. He delayed writing to Frances for some while, simply
      because he could not tune himself up to enthusiasm when worried by
      suspicions of such a kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the Millbornes had returned to London, and Frances was growing
      anxious. In talking to her mother of Cope she had innocently alluded to
      his curious inquiry if her mother and her step-father were connected by
      any tie of cousinship. Mrs. Millborne made her repeat the words. Frances
      did so, and watched with inquisitive eyes their effect upon her elder.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What is there so startling in his inquiry then?' she asked. 'Can it have
      anything to do with his not writing to me?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mother flinched, but did not inform her, and Frances also was now
      drawn within the atmosphere of suspicion. That night when standing by
      chance outside the chamber of her parents she heard for the first time
      their voices engaged in a sharp altercation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The apple of discord had, indeed, been dropped into the house of the
      Millbornes. The scene within the chamber-door was Mrs. Millborne standing
      before her dressing-table, looking across to her husband in the
      dressing-room adjoining, where he was sitting down, his eyes fixed on the
      floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why did you come and disturb my life a second time?' she harshly asked.
      'Why did you pester me with your conscience, till I was driven to accept
      you to get rid of your importunity? Frances and I were doing well: the one
      desire of my life was that she should marry that good young man. And now
      the match is broken off by your cruel interference! Why did you show
      yourself in my world again, and raise this scandal upon my hard-won
      respectability-won by such weary years of labour as none will ever know!'
      She bent her face upon the table and wept passionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no reply from Mr. Millborne. Frances lay awake nearly all that
      night, and when at breakfast-time the next morning still no letter
      appeared from Mr. Cope, she entreated her mother to go to Ivell and see if
      the young man were ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Millborne went, returning the same day. Frances, anxious and haggard,
      met her at the station.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was all well? Her mother could not say it was; though he was not ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing she had found out, that it was a mistake to hunt up a man when
      his inclinations were to hold aloof. Returning with her mother in the cab
      Frances insisted upon knowing what the mystery was which plainly had
      alienated her lover. The precise words which had been spoken at the
      interview with him that day at Ivell Mrs. Millborne could not be induced
      to repeat; but thus far she admitted, that the estrangement was
      fundamentally owing to Mr. Millborne having sought her out and married
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And why did he seek you out-and why were you obliged to marry him?' asked
      the distressed girl. Then the evidences pieced themselves together in her
      acute mind, and, her colour gradually rising, she asked her mother if what
      they pointed to was indeed the fact. Her mother admitted that it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      A flush of mortification succeeded to the flush of shame upon the young
      woman's face. How could a scrupulously correct clergyman and lover like
      Mr. Cope ask her to be his wife after this discovery of her irregular
      birth? She covered her eyes with her hands in a silent despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the presence of Mr. Millborne they at first suppressed their anguish.
      But by and by their feelings got the better of them, and when he was
      asleep in his chair after dinner Mrs. Millborne's irritation broke out.
      The embittered Frances joined her in reproaching the man who had come as
      the spectre to their intended feast of Hymen, and turned its promise to
      ghastly failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why were you so weak, mother, as to admit such an enemy to your house-one
      so obviously your evil genius-much less accept him as a husband, after so
      long? If you had only told me all, I could have advised you better! But I
      suppose I have no right to reproach him, bitter as I feel, and even though
      he has blighted my life for ever!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Frances, I did hold out; I saw it was a mistake to have any more to say
      to a man who had been such an unmitigated curse to me! But he would not
      listen; he kept on about his conscience and mine, till I was bewildered,
      and said Yes! . . . Bringing us away from a quiet town where we were known
      and respected-what an ill-considered thing it was! O the content of those
      days! We had society there, people in our own position, who did not expect
      more of us than we expected of them. Here, where there is so much, there
      is nothing! He said London society was so bright and brilliant that it
      would be like a new world. It may be to those who are in it; but what is
      that to us two lonely women; we only see it flashing past! . . . O the
      fool, the fool that I was!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Millborne was not so soundly asleep as to prevent his hearing these
      animadversions that were almost execrations, and many more of the same
      sort. As there was no peace for him at home, he went again to his club,
      where, since his reunion with Leonora, he had seldom if ever been seen.
      But the shadow of the troubles in his household interfered with his
      comfort here also; he could not, as formerly, settle down into his
      favourite chair with the evening paper, reposeful in the celibate's sense
      that where he was his world's centre had its fixture. His world was now an
      ellipse, with a dual centrality, of which his own was not the major.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young curate of Ivell still held aloof, tantalizing Frances by his
      elusiveness. Plainly he was waiting upon events. Millborne bore the
      reproaches of his wife and daughter almost in silence; but by degrees he
      grew meditative, as if revolving a new idea. The bitter cry about
      blighting their existence at length became so impassioned that one day
      Millborne calmly proposed to return again to the country; not necessarily
      to Exonbury, but, if they were willing, to a little old manor-house which
      he had found was to be let, standing a mile from Mr. Cope's town of Ivell.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were surprised, and, despite their view of him as the bringer of ill,
      were disposed to accede. 'Though I suppose,' said Mrs. Millborne to him,
      'it will end in Mr. Cope's asking you flatly about the past, and your
      being compelled to tell him; which may dash all my hopes for Frances. She
      gets more and more like you every day, particularly when she is in a bad
      temper. People will see you together, and notice it; and I don't know what
      may come of it!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't think they will see us together,' he said; but he entered into no
      argument when she insisted otherwise. The removal was eventually resolved
      on; the town-house was disposed of; and again came the invasion by
      furniture-men and vans, till all the movables and servants were whisked
      away. He sent his wife and daughter to an hotel while this was going on,
      taking two or three journeys himself to Ivell to superintend the refixing,
      and the improvement of the grounds. When all was done he returned to them
      in town.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house was ready for their reception, he told them, and there only
      remained the journey. He accompanied them and their personal luggage to
      the station only, having, he said, to remain in town a short time on
      business with his lawyer. They went, dubious and discontented-for the
      much-loved Cope had made no sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      'If we were going down to live here alone,' said Mrs Millborne to her
      daughter in the train; 'and there was no intrusive tell-tale presence! . .
      . But let it be!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The house was a lovely little place in a grove of elms, and they liked it
      much. The first person to call upon them as new residents was Mr. Cope. He
      was delighted to find that they had come so near, and (though he did not
      say this) meant to live in such excellent style. He had not, however,
      resumed the manner of a lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Your father spoils all!' murmured Mrs. Millborne.
    </p>
    <p>
      But three days later she received a letter from her husband, which caused
      her no small degree of astonishment. It was written from Boulogne.
    </p>
    <p>
      It began with a long explanation of settlements of his property, in which
      he had been engaged since their departure. The chief feature in the
      business was that Mrs. Millborne found herself the absolute owner of a
      comfortable sum in personal estate, and Frances of a life-interest in a
      larger sum, the principal to be afterwards divided amongst her children if
      she had any. The remainder of his letter ran as hereunder:-
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have learnt that there are some derelictions of duty which cannot be
      blotted out by tardy accomplishment. Our evil actions do not remain
      isolated in the past, waiting only to be reversed: like locomotive plants
      they spread and re-root, till to destroy the original stem has no material
      effect in killing them. I made a mistake in searching you out; I admit it;
      whatever the remedy may be in such cases it is not marriage, and the best
      thing for you and me is that you do not see me more. You had better not
      seek me, for you will not be likely to find me: you are well provided for,
      and we may do ourselves more harm than good by meeting again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'F. M.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Millborne, in short, disappeared from that day forward. But a searching
      inquiry would have revealed that, soon after the Millbornes went to Ivell,
      an Englishman, who did not give the name of Millborne, took up his
      residence in Brussels; a man who might have been recognized by Mrs.
      Millborne if she had met him. One afternoon in the ensuing summer, when
      this gentleman was looking over the English papers, he saw the
      announcement of Miss Frances Frankland's marriage. She had become the
      Reverend Mrs. Cope.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Thank God!' said the gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his momentary satisfaction was far from being happiness. As he
      formerly had been weighted with a bad conscience, so now was he burdened
      with the heavy thought which oppressed Antigone, that by honourable
      observance of a rite he had obtained for himself the reward of
      dishonourable laxity. Occasionally he had to be helped to his lodgings by
      his servant from the Cercle he frequented, through having imbibed a little
      too much liquor to be able to take care of himself. But he was harmless,
      and even when he had been drinking said little.

      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <p>
      The shouts of the village-boys came in at the window, accompanied by
      broken laughter from loungers at the inn-door; but the brothers Halborough
      worked on.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were sitting in a bedroom of the master-millwright's house, engaged
      in the untutored reading of Greek and Latin. It was no tale of Homeric
      blows and knocks, Argonautic voyaging, or Theban family woe that inflamed
      their imaginations and spurred them onward. They were plodding away at the
      Greek Testament, immersed in a chapter of the idiomatic and difficult
      Epistle to the Hebrews.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Dog-day sun in its decline reached the low ceiling with slanting
      sides, and the shadows of the great goat's-willow swayed and interchanged
      upon the walls like a spectral army manoeuvring. The open casement which
      admitted the remoter sounds now brought the voice of some one close at
      hand. It was their sister, a pretty girl of fourteen, who stood in the
      court below.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I can see the tops of your heads! What's the use of staying up there? I
      like you not to go out with the street-boys; but do come and play with
      me!'
    </p>
    <p>
      They treated her as an inadequate interlocutor, and put her off with some
      slight word. She went away disappointed. Presently there was a dull noise
      of heavy footsteps at the side of the house, and one of the brothers sat
      up. 'I fancy I hear him coming,' he murmured, his eyes on the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man in the light drab clothes of an old-fashioned country tradesman
      approached from round the corner, reeling as he came. The elder son
      flushed with anger, rose from his books, and descended the stairs. The
      younger sat on, till, after the lapse of a few minutes, his brother re-
      entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Did Rosa see him?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nor anybody?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What have you done with him?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He's in the straw-shed. I got him in with some trouble, and he has fallen
      asleep. I thought this would be the explanation of his absence! No stones
      dressed for Miller Kench, the great wheel of the saw-mills waiting for new
      float-boards, even the poor folk not able to get their waggons wheeled.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What is the use of poring over this!' said the younger, shutting up
      Donnegan's Lexicon with a slap. 'O if we had only been able to keep
      mother's nine hundred pounds, what we could have done!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How well she had estimated the sum necessary! Four hundred and fifty
      each, she thought. And I have no doubt that we could have done it on that,
      with care.'
    </p>
    <p>
      This loss of the nine hundred pounds was the sharp thorn of their crown.
      It was a sum which their mother had amassed with great exertion and
      self-denial, by adding to a chance legacy such other small amounts as she
      could lay hands on from time to time; and she had intended with the hoard
      to indulge the dear wish of her heart-that of sending her sons, Joshua and
      Cornelius, to one of the Universities, having been informed that from four
      hundred to four hundred and fifty each might carry them through their
      terms with such great economy as she knew she could trust them to
      practise. But she had died a year or two before this time, worn out by too
      keen a strain towards these ends; and the money, coming unreservedly into
      the hands of their father, had been nearly dissipated. With its exhaustion
      went all opportunity and hope of a university degree for the sons.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It drives me mad when I think of it,' said Joshua, the elder. 'And here
      we work and work in our own bungling way, and the utmost we can hope for
      is a term of years as national schoolmasters, and possible admission to a
      Theological college, and ordination as despised licentiates.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The anger of the elder was reflected as simple sadness in the face of the
      other. 'We can preach the Gospel as well without a hood on our surplices
      as with one,' he said with feeble consolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Preach the Gospel-true,' said Joshua with a slight pursing of mouth. 'But
      we can't rise!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Let us make the best of it, and grind on.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The other was silent, and they drearily bent over their books again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cause of all this gloom, the millwright Halborough, now snoring in the
      shed, had been a thriving master-machinist, notwithstanding his free and
      careless disposition, till a taste for a more than adequate quantity of
      strong liquor took hold of him; since when his habits had interfered with
      his business sadly. Already millers went elsewhere for their gear, and
      only one set of hands was now kept going, though there were formerly two.
      Already he found a difficulty in meeting his men at the week's end, and
      though they had been reduced in number there was barely enough work to do
      for those who remained.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun dropped lower and vanished, the shouts of the village children
      ceased to resound, darkness cloaked the students' bedroom, and all the
      scene outwardly breathed peace. None knew of the fevered youthful
      ambitions that throbbed in two breasts within the quiet creeper-covered
      walls of the millwright's house.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few months the brothers left the village of their birth to enter
      themselves as students in a training college for schoolmasters; first
      having placed their young sister Rosa under as efficient a tuition at a
      fashionable watering-place as the means at their disposal could command.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <p>
      A man in semi-clerical dress was walking along the road which led from the
      railway-station into a provincial town. As he walked he read persistently,
      only looking up once now and then to see that he was keeping on the foot
      track and to avoid other passengers. At those moments, whoever had known
      the former students at the millwright's would have perceived that one of
      them, Joshua Halborough, was the peripatetic reader here.
    </p>
    <p>
      What had been simple force in the youth's face was energized judgment in
      the man's. His character was gradually writing itself out in his
      countenance. That he was watching his own career with deeper and deeper
      interest, that he continually 'heard his days before him,' and cared to
      hear little else, might have been hazarded from what was seen there. His
      ambitions were, in truth, passionate, yet controlled; so that the germs of
      many more plans than ever blossomed to maturity had place in him; and
      forward visions were kept purposely in twilight, to avoid distraction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Events so far had been encouraging. Shortly after assuming the mastership
      of his first school he had obtained an introduction to the Bishop of a
      diocese far from his native county, who had looked upon him as a promising
      young man and taken him in hand. He was now in the second year of his
      residence at the theological college of the cathedral-town, and would soon
      be presented for ordination.
    </p>
    <p>
      He entered the town, turned into a back street, and then into a yard,
      keeping his book before him till he set foot under the arch of the latter
      place. Round the arch was written 'National School,' and the stonework of
      the jambs was worn away as nothing but boys and the waves of ocean will
      wear it. He was soon amid the sing-song accents of the scholars.
    </p>
    <p>
      His brother Cornelius, who was the schoolmaster here, laid down the
      pointer with which he was directing attention to the Capes of Europe, and
      came forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's his brother Jos!' whispered one of the sixth standard boys. 'He's
      going to be a pa'son, he's now at college.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Corney is going to be one too, when he's saved enough money,' said
      another.
    </p>
    <p>
      After greeting his brother, whom he had not seen for several months, the
      junior began to explain his system of teaching geography.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Halborough the elder took no interest in the subject. 'How about your
      own studies?' he asked. 'Did you get the books I sent?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Cornelius had received them, and he related what he was doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mind you work in the morning. What time do you get up?'
    </p>
    <p>
      The younger replied: 'Half-past five.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Half-past four is not a minute too soon this time of the year. There is
      no time like the morning for construing. I don't know why, but when I feel
      even too dreary to read a novel I can translate-there is something
      mechanical about it I suppose. Now, Cornelius, you are rather behindhand,
      and have some heavy reading before you if you mean to get out of this next
      Christmas.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am afraid I have.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'We must soon sound the Bishop. I am sure you will get a title without
      difficulty when he has heard all. The sub-dean, the principal of my
      college, says that the best plan will be for you to come there when his
      lordship is present at an examination, and he'll get you a personal
      interview with him. Mind you make a good impression upon him. I found in
      my case that that was everything and doctrine almost nothing. You'll do
      for a deacon, Corney, if not for a priest.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The younger remained thoughtful. 'Have you heard from Rosa lately?' he
      asked; 'I had a letter this morning.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. The little minx writes rather too often. She is homesick-though
      Brussels must be an attractive place enough. But she must make the most of
      her time over there. I thought a year would be enough for her, after that
      high-class school at Sandbourne, but I have decided to give her two, and
      make a good job of it, expensive as the establishment is.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Their two rather harsh faces had softened directly they began to speak of
      their sister, whom they loved more ambitiously than they loved themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But where is the money to come from, Joshua?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have already got it.' He looked round, and finding that some boys were
      near withdrew a few steps. 'I have borrowed it at five per cent. from the
      farmer who used to occupy the farm next our field. You remember him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But about paying him?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I shall pay him by degrees out of my stipend. No, Cornelius, it was no
      use to do the thing by halves. She promises to be a most attractive, not
      to say beautiful, girl. I have seen that for years; and if her face is not
      her fortune, her face and her brains together will be, if I observe and
      contrive aright. That she should be, every inch of her, an accomplished
      and refined woman, was indispensable for the fulfilment of her destiny,
      and for moving onwards and upwards with us; and she'll do it, you will
      see. I'd half starve myself rather than take her away from that school
      now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      They looked round the school they were in. To Cornelius it was natural and
      familiar enough, but to Joshua, with his limited human sympathies, who had
      just dropped in from a superior sort of place, the sight jarred
      unpleasantly, as being that of something he had left behind. 'I shall be
      glad when you are out of this,' he said, 'and in your pulpit, and well
      through your first sermon.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You may as well say inducted into my fat living, while you are about it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, well-don't think lightly of the Church. There's a fine work for any
      man of energy in the Church, as you'll find,' he said fervidly. 'Torrents
      of infidelity to be stemmed, new views of old subjects to be expounded,
      truths in spirit to be substituted for truths in the letter . . . ' He
      lapsed into reverie with the vision of his career, persuading himself that
      it was ardour for Christianity which spurred him on, and not pride of
      place. He had shouldered a body of doctrine, and was prepared to defend it
      tooth and nail, solely for the honour and glory that warriors win.
    </p>
    <p>
      'If the Church is elastic, and stretches to the shape of the time, she'll
      last, I suppose,' said Cornelius. 'If not-. Only think, I bought a copy of
      Paley's Evidences, best edition, broad margins, excellent preservation, at
      a bookstall the other day for-ninepence; and I thought that at this rate
      Christianity must be in rather a bad way.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, no!' said the other almost, angrily. 'It only shows that such
      defences are no longer necessary. Men's eyes can see the truth without
      extraneous assistance. Besides, we are in for Christianity, and must stick
      to her whether or no. I am just now going right through Pusey's Library of
      the Fathers.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You'll be a bishop, Joshua, before you have done!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah!' said the other bitterly, shaking his head. 'Perhaps I might have
      been-I might have been! But where is my D.D. or LL.D.; and how be a bishop
      without that kind of appendage? Archbishop Tillotson was the son of a
      Sowerby clothier, but he was sent to Clare College. To hail Oxford or
      Cambridge as alma mater is not for me-for us! My God! when I think of what
      we should have been-what fair promise has been blighted by that cursed,
      worthless-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hush, hush! . . . But I feel it, too, as much as you. I have seen it more
      forcibly lately. You would have obtained your degree long before this
      time-possibly fellowship-and I should have been on my way to mine.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't talk of it,' said the other. 'We must do the best we can.'
    </p>
    <p>
      They looked out of the window sadly, through the dusty panes, so high up
      that only the sky was visible. By degrees the haunting trouble loomed
      again, and Cornelius broke the silence with a whisper: 'He has called on
      me!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The living pulses died on Joshua's face, which grew arid as a cIRONlinker.
      'When was that?' he asked quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Last week.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How did he get here-so many miles?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Came by railway. He came to ask for money.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He says he will call on you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Joshua replied resignedly. The theme of their conversation spoilt his
      buoyancy for that afternoon. He returned in the evening, Cornelius
      accompanying him to the station; but he did not read in the train which
      took him back to the Fountall Theological College, as he had done on the
      way out. That ineradicable trouble still remained as a squalid spot in the
      expanse of his life. He sat with the other students in the cathedral choir
      next day; and the recollection of the trouble obscured the purple
      splendour thrown by the panes upon the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was afternoon. All was as still in the Close as a cathedral-green can
      be between the Sunday services, and the incessant cawing of the rooks was
      the only sound. Joshua Halborough had finished his ascetic lunch, and had
      gone into the library, where he stood for a few moments looking out of the
      large window facing the green. He saw walking slowly across it a man in a
      fustian coat and a battered white hat with a much- ruffled nap, having
      upon his arm a tall gipsy-woman wearing long brass earrings. The man was
      staring quizzically at the west front of the cathedral, and Halborough
      recognized in him the form and features of his father. Who the woman was
      he knew not. Almost as soon as Joshua became conscious of these things,
      the sub-dean, who was also the principal of the college, and of whom the
      young man stood in more awe than of the Bishop himself, emerged from the
      gate and entered a path across the Close. The pair met the dignitary, and
      to Joshua's horror his father turned and addressed the sub-dean.
    </p>
    <p>
      What passed between them he could not tell. But as he stood in a cold
      sweat he saw his father place his hand familiarly on the sub-dean's
      shoulder; the shrinking response of the latter, and his quick withdrawal,
      told his feeling. The woman seemed to say nothing, but when the sub-dean
      had passed by they came on towards the college gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Halborough flew along the corridor and out at a side door, so as to
      intercept them before they could reach the front entrance, for which they
      were making. He caught them behind a clump of laurel.
    </p>
    <p>
      'By Jerry, here's the very chap! Well, you're a fine fellow, Jos, never to
      send your father as much as a twist o' baccy on such an occasion, and to
      leave him to travel all these miles to find ye out!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'First, who is this?' said Joshua Halborough with pale dignity, waving his
      hand towards the buxom woman with the great earrings.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dammy, the mis'ess! Your step-mother! Didn't you know I'd married? She
      helped me home from market one night, and we came to terms, and struck the
      bargain. Didn't we, Selinar?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oi, by the great Lord an' we did!' simpered the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, what sort of a place is this you are living in?' asked the
      millwright. 'A kind of house-of-correction, apparently?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Joshua listened abstractedly, his features set to resignation. Sick at
      heart he was going to ask them if they were in want of any necessary, any
      meal, when his father cut him short by saying, 'Why, we've called to ask
      ye to come round and take pot-luck with us at the Cock-and-Bottle, where
      we've put up for the day, on our way to see mis'ess's friends at Binegar
      Fair, where they'll be lying under canvas for a night or two. As for the
      victuals at the Cock I can't testify to 'em at all; but for the drink,
      they've the rarest drop of Old Tom that I've tasted for many a year.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Thanks; but I am a teetotaller; and I have lunched,' said Joshua, who
      could fully believe his father's testimony to the gin, from the odour of
      his breath. 'You see we have to observe regular habits here; and I
      couldn't be seen at the Cock-and-Bottle just now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O dammy, then don't come, your reverence. Perhaps you won't mind standing
      treat for those who can be seen there?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not a penny,' said the younger firmly. 'You've had enough already.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Thank you for nothing. By the bye, who was that spindle-legged, shoe-
      buckled parson feller we met by now? He seemed to think we should poison
      him!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Joshua remarked coldly that it was the principal of his college, guardedly
      inquiring, 'Did you tell him whom you were come to see?'
    </p>
    <p>
      His father did not reply. He and his strapping gipsy wife-if she were his
      wife-stayed no longer, and disappeared in the direction of the High
      Street. Joshua Halborough went back to the library. Determined as was his
      nature, he wept hot tears upon the books, and was immeasurably more
      wretched that afternoon than the unwelcome millwright. In the evening he
      sat down and wrote a letter to his brother, in which, after stating what
      had happened, and expatiating upon this new disgrace in the gipsy wife, he
      propounded a plan for raising money sufficient to induce the couple to
      emigrate to Canada. 'It is our only chance,' he said. 'The case as it
      stands is maddening. For a successful painter, sculptor, musician, author,
      who takes society by storm, it is no drawback, it is sometimes even a
      romantic recommendation, to hail from outcasts and profligates. But for a
      clergyman of the Church of England! Cornelius, it is fatal! To succeed in
      the Church, people must believe in you, first of all, as a gentleman,
      secondly as a man of means, thirdly as a scholar, fourthly as a preacher,
      fifthly, perhaps, as a Christian,-but always first as a gentleman, with
      all their heart and soul and strength. I would have faced the fact of
      being a small machinist's son, and have taken my chance, if he'd been in
      any sense respectable and decent. The essence of Christianity is humility,
      and by the help of God I would have brazened it out. But this terrible
      vagabondage and disreputable connection! If he does not accept my terms
      and leave the country, it will extinguish us and kill me. For how can we
      live, and relinquish our high aim, and bring down our dear sister Rosa to
      the level of a gipsy's step-daughter?'

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <p>
      There was excitement in the parish of Narrobourne one day. The
      congregation had just come out from morning service, and the whole
      conversation was of the new curate, Mr. Halborough, who had officiated for
      the first time, in the absence of the rector.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never before had the feeling of the villagers approached a level which
      could be called excitement on such a matter as this. The droning which had
      been the rule in that quiet old place for a century seemed ended at last.
      They repeated the text to each other as a refrain: 'O Lord, be thou my
      helper!' Not within living memory till to-day had the subject of the
      sermon formed the topic of conversation from the church door to
      church-yard gate, to the exclusion of personal remarks on those who had
      been present, and on the week's news in general.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thrilling periods of the preacher hung about their minds all that day.
      The parish being steeped in indifferentism, it happened that when the
      youths and maidens, middle-aged and old people, who had attended church
      that morning, recurred as by a fascination to what Halborough had said,
      they did so more or less indirectly, and even with the subterfuge of a
      light laugh that was not real, so great was their shyness under the
      novelty of their sensations.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was more curious than that these unconventional villagers should have
      been excited by a preacher of a new school after forty years of
      familiarity with the old hand who had had charge of their souls, was the
      effect of Halborough's address upon the occupants of the manor-house pew,
      including the owner of the estate. These thought they knew how to discount
      the mere sensational sermon, how to minimize flash oratory to its bare
      proportions; but they had yielded like the rest of the assembly to the
      charm of the newcomer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fellmer, the landowner, was a young widower, whose mother, still in
      the prime of life, had returned to her old position in the family mansion
      since the death of her son's wife in the year after her marriage, at the
      birth of a fragile little girl. From the date of his loss to the present
      time, Fellmer had led an inactive existence in the seclusion of the
      parish; a lack of motive seemed to leave him listless. He had gladly
      reinstated his mother in the gloomy house, and his main occupation now lay
      in stewarding his estate, which was not large. Mrs. Fellmer, who had sat
      beside him under Halborough this morning, was a cheerful, straightforward
      woman, who did her marketing and her alms- giving in person, was fond of
      old-fashioned flowers, and walked about the village on very wet days
      visiting the parishioners. These, the only two great ones of Narrobourne,
      were impressed by Joshua's eloquence as much as the cottagers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Halborough had been briefly introduced to them on his arrival some days
      before, and, their interest being kindled, they waited a few moments till
      he came out of the vestry, to walk down the churchyard-path with him. Mrs.
      Fellmer spoke warmly of the sermon, of the good fortune of the parish in
      his advent, and hoped he had found comfortable quarters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Halborough, faintly flushing, said that he had obtained very fair lodgings
      in the roomy house of a farmer, whom he named.
    </p>
    <p>
      She feared he would find it very lonely, especially in the evenings, and
      hoped they would see a good deal of him. When would he dine with them?
      Could he not come that day-it must be so dull for him the first Sunday
      evening in country lodgings?
    </p>
    <p>
      Halborough replied that it would give him much pleasure, but that he
      feared he must decline. 'I am not altogether alone,' he said. 'My sister,
      who has just returned from Brussels, and who felt, as you do, that I
      should be rather dismal by myself, has accompanied me hither to stay a few
      days till she has put my rooms in order and set me going. She was too
      fatigued to come to church, and is waiting for me now at the farm.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, but bring your sister-that will be still better! I shall be delighted
      to know her. How I wish I had been aware! Do tell her, please, that we had
      no idea of her presence.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Halborough assured Mrs. Fellmer that he would certainly bear the message;
      but as to her coming he was not so sure. The real truth was, however, that
      the matter would be decided by him, Rosa having an almost filial respect
      for his wishes. But he was uncertain as to the state of her wardrobe, and
      had determined that she should not enter the manor- house at a
      disadvantage that evening, when there would probably be plenty of
      opportunities in the future of her doing so becomingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked to the farm in long strides. This, then, was the outcome of his
      first morning's work as curate here. Things had gone fairly well with him.
      He had been ordained; he was in a comfortable parish, where he would
      exercise almost sole supervision, the rector being infirm. He had made a
      deep impression at starting, and the absence of a hood seemed to have done
      him no harm. Moreover, by considerable persuasion and payment, his father
      and the dark woman had been shipped off to Canada, where they were not
      likely to interfere greatly with his interests.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosa came out to meet him. 'Ah! you should have gone to church like a good
      girl,' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes-I wished I had afterwards. But I do so hate church as a rule that
      even your preaching was underestimated in my mind. It was too bad of me!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl who spoke thus playfully was fair, tall, and sylph-like, in a
      muslin dress, and with just the coquettish desinvolture which an English
      girl brings home from abroad, and loses again after a few months of native
      life. Joshua was the reverse of playful; the world was too important a
      concern for him to indulge in light moods. He told her in decided,
      practical phraseology of the invitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now, Rosa, we must go-that's settled-if you've a dress that can be made
      fit to wear all on the hop like this. You didn't, of course, think of
      bringing an evening dress to such an out-of-the-way place?'
    </p>
    <p>
      But Rosa had come from the wrong city to be caught napping in those
      matters. 'Yes, I did,' said she. 'One never knows what may turn up.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well done! Then off we go at seven.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening drew on, and at dusk they started on foot, Rosa pulling up the
      edge of her skirt under her cloak out of the way of the dews, so that it
      formed a great wind-bag all round her, and carrying her satin shoes under
      her arm. Joshua would not let her wait till she got indoors before
      changing them, as she proposed, but insisted on her performing that
      operation under a tree, so that they might enter as if they had not
      walked. He was nervously formal about such trifles, while Rosa took the
      whole proceeding-walk, dressing, dinner, and all-as a pastime. To Joshua
      it was a serious step in life.
    </p>
    <p>
      A more unexpected kind of person for a curate's sister was never presented
      at a dinner. The surprise of Mrs. Fellmer was unconcealed. She had looked
      forward to a Dorcas, or Martha, or Rhoda at the outside, and a shade of
      misgiving crossed her face. It was possible that, had the young lady
      accompanied her brother to church, there would have been no dining at
      Narrobourne House that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not so with the young widower, her son. He resembled a sleeper who had
      awaked in a summer noon expecting to find it only dawn. He could scarcely
      help stretching his arms and yawning in their faces, so strong was his
      sense of being suddenly aroused to an unforeseen thing. When they had sat
      down to table he at first talked to Rosa somewhat with the air of a ruler
      in the land; but the woman lurking in the acquaintance soon brought him to
      his level, and the girl from Brussels saw him looking at her mouth, her
      hands, her contour, as if he could not quite comprehend how they got
      created: then he dropped into the more satisfactory stage which discerns
      no particulars.
    </p>
    <p>
      He talked but little; she said much. The homeliness of the Fellmers, to
      her view, though they were regarded with such awe down here, quite
      disembarrassed her. The squire had become so unpractised, had dropped so
      far into the shade during the last year or so of his life, that he had
      almost forgotten what the world contained till this evening reminded him.
      His mother, after her first moments of doubt, appeared to think that he
      must be left to his own guidance, and gave her attention to Joshua.
    </p>
    <p>
      With all his foresight and doggedness of aim, the result of that dinner
      exceeded Halborough's expectations. In weaving his ambitions he had viewed
      his sister Rosa as a slight, bright thing to be helped into notice by his
      abilities; but it now began to dawn upon him that the physical gifts of
      nature to her might do more for them both than nature's intellectual gifts
      to himself. While he was patiently boring the tunnel Rosa seemed about to
      fly over the mountain.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wrote the next day to his brother, now occupying his own old rooms in
      the theological college, telling him exultingly of the unanticipated debut
      of Rosa at the manor-house. The next post brought him a reply of
      congratulation, dashed with the counteracting intelligence that his father
      did not like Canada-that his wife had deserted him, which made him feel so
      dreary that he thought of returning home.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his recent satisfaction at his own successes Joshua Halborough had
      well-nigh forgotten his chronic trouble-latterly screened by distance. But
      it now returned upon him; he saw more in this brief announcement than his
      brother seemed to see. It was the cloud no bigger than a man's hand.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      The following December, a day or two before Christmas, Mrs. Fellmer and
      her son were walking up and down the broad gravel path which bordered the
      east front of the house. Till within the last half-hour the morning had
      been a drizzling one, and they had just emerged for a short turn before
      luncheon.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You see, dear mother,' the son was saying, 'it is the peculiarity of my
      position which makes her appear to me in such a desirable light. When you
      consider how I have been crippled at starting, how my life has been
      maimed; that I feel anything like publicity distasteful, that I have ye no
      political ambition, and that my chief aim and hope lie in the education of
      the little thing Annie has left me, you must see how desirable a wife like
      Miss Halborough would be, to prevent my becoming a mere vegetable.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If you adore her, I suppose you must have her!' replied his mother with
      dry indirectness. 'But you'll find that she will not be content to live on
      here as you do, giving her whole mind to a young child.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's just where we differ. Her very disqualification, that of being a
      nobody, as you call it, is her recommendation in my eyes. Her lack of
      influential connections limits her ambition. From what I know of her, a
      life in this place is all that she would wish for. She would never care to
      go outside the park-gates if it were necessary to stay within.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Being in love with her, Albert, and meaning to marry her, you invent your
      practical reasons to make the case respectable. Well, do as you will; I
      have no authority over you, so why should you consult me? You mean to
      propose on this very occasion, no doubt. Don't you, now?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'By no means. I am merely revolving the idea in my mind. If on further
      acquaintance she turns out to be as good as she has hitherto seemed-well,
      I shall see. Admit, now, that you like her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I readily admit it. She is very captivating at first sight. But as a
      stepmother to your child! You seem mighty anxious, Albert, to get rid of
      me!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not at all. And I am not so reckless as you think. I don't make up my
      mind in a hurry. But the thought having occurred to me, I mention it to
      you at once, mother. If you dislike it, say so.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't say anything. I will try to make the best of it if you are
      determined. When does she come?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'To-morrow.'
    </p>
    <p>
      All this time there were great preparations in train at the curate's, who
      was now a householder. Rosa, whose two or three weeks' stay on two
      occasions earlier in the year had so affected the squire, was coming
      again, and at the same time her younger brother Cornelius, to make up a
      family party. Rosa, who journeyed from the Midlands, could not arrive till
      late in the evening, but Cornelius was to get there in the afternoon,
      Joshua going out to meet him in his walk across the fields from the
      railway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything being ready in Joshua's modest abode he started on his way, his
      heart buoyant and thankful, if ever it was in his life. He was of such
      good report himself that his brother's path into holy orders promised to
      be unexpectedly easy; and he longed to compare experiences with him, even
      though there was on hand a more exciting matter still. From his youth he
      had held that, in old-fashioned country places, the Church conferred
      social prestige up to a certain point at a cheaper price than any other
      profession or pursuit; and events seemed to be proving him right.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had walked about half an hour when he saw Cornelius coming along the
      path; and in a few minutes the two brothers met. The experiences of
      Cornelius had been less immediately interesting than those of Joshua, but
      his personal position was satisfactory, and there was nothing to account
      for the singularly subdued manner that he exhibited, which at first Joshua
      set down to the fatigue of over-study; and he proceeded to the subject of
      Rosa's arrival in the evening, and the probable consequences of this her
      third visit. 'Before next Easter she'll be his wife, my boy,' said Joshua
      with grave exultation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cornelius shook his head. 'She comes too late!' he returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What do you mean?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Look here.' He produced the Fountall paper, and placed his finger on a
      paragraph, which Joshua read. It appeared under the report of Petty
      Sessions, and was a commonplace case of disorderly conduct, in which a man
      was sent to prison for seven days for breaking windows in that town.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well?' said Joshua.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It happened during an evening that I was in the street; and the offender
      is our father.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not-how-I sent him more money on his promising to stay in Canada?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He is home, safe enough.' Cornelius in the same gloomy tone gave the
      remainder of his information. He had witnessed the scene, unobserved of
      his father, and had heard him say that he was on his way to see his
      daughter, who was going to marry a rich gentleman. The only good fortune
      attending the untoward incident was that the millwright's name had been
      printed as Joshua Alborough.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Beaten! We are to be beaten on the eve of our expected victory!' said the
      elder brother. 'How did he guess that Rosa was likely to marry? Good
      Heaven Cornelius, you seem doomed to bring bad news always, do you not!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I do,' said Cornelius. 'Poor Rosa!'
    </p>
    <p>
      It was almost in tears, so great was their heart-sickness and shame, that
      the brothers walked the remainder of the way to Joshua's dwelling. In the
      evening they set out to meet Rosa, bringing her to the village in a fly;
      and when she had come into the house, and was sitting down with them, they
      almost forgot their secret anxiety in contemplating her, who knew nothing
      about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day the Fellmers came, and the two or three days after that were a
      lively time. That the squire was yielding to his impulses-making up his
      mind-there could be no doubt. On Sunday Cornelius read the lessons, and
      Joshua preached. Mrs. Fellmer was quite maternal towards Rosa, and it
      appeared that she had decided to welcome the inevitable with a good grace.
      The pretty girl was to spend yet another afternoon with the elder lady,
      superintending some parish treat at the house in observance of Christmas,
      and afterwards to stay on to dinner, her brothers to fetch her in the
      evening. They were also invited to dine, but they could not accept owing
      to an engagement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engagement was of a sombre sort. They were going to meet their father,
      who would that day be released from Fountall Gaol, and try to persuade him
      to keep away from Narrobourne. Every exertion was to be made to get him
      back to Canada, to his old home in the Midlands-anywhere, so that he would
      not impinge disastrously upon their courses, and blast their sister's
      prospects of the auspicious marriage which was just then hanging in the
      balance.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as Rosa had been fetched away by her friends at the manor-house
      her brothers started on their expedition, without waiting for dinner or
      tea. Cornelius, to whom the millwright always addressed his letters when
      he wrote any, drew from his pocket and re-read as he walked the curt note
      which had led to this journey being undertaken; it was despatched by their
      father the night before, immediately upon his liberation, and stated that
      he was setting out for Narrobourne at the moment of writing; that having
      no money he would be obliged to walk all the way; that he calculated on
      passing through the intervening town of Ivell about six on the following
      day, where he should sup at the Castle Inn, and where he hoped they would
      meet him with a carriage-and-pair, or some other such conveyance, that he
      might not disgrace them by arriving like a tramp.
    </p>
    <p>
      'That sounds as if he gave a thought to our position,' said Cornelius.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joshua knew the satire that lurked in the paternal words, and said
      nothing. Silence prevailed during the greater part of their journey. The
      lamps were lighted in Ivell when they entered the streets, and Cornelius,
      who was quite unknown in this neighbourhood, and who, moreover, was not in
      clerical attire, decided that he should be the one to call at the Castle
      Inn. Here, in answer to his inquiry under the darkness of the archway,
      they told him that such a man as he had described left the house about a
      quarter of an hour earlier, after making a meal in the kitchen-settle. He
      was rather the worse for liquor.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then,' said Joshua, when Cornelius joined him outside with this
      intelligence, 'we must have met and passed him! And now that I think of
      it, we did meet some one who was unsteady in his gait, under the trees on
      the other side of Hendford Hill, where it was too dark to see him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      They rapidly retraced their steps; but for a long stretch of the way home
      could discern nobody. When, however, they had gone about three- quarters
      of the distance, they became conscious of an irregular footfall in front
      of them, and could see a whitish figure in the gloom. They followed
      dubiously. The figure met another wayfarer-the single one that had been
      encountered upon this lonely road-and they distinctly heard him ask the
      way to Narrobourne. The stranger replied-what was quite true-that the
      nearest way was by turning in at the stile by the next bridge, and
      following the footpath which branched thence across the meadows.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the brothers reached the stile they also entered the path, but did
      not overtake the subject of their worry till they had crossed two or three
      meads, and the lights from Narrobourne manor-house were visible before
      them through the trees. Their father was no longer walking; he was seated
      against the wet bank of an adjoining hedge. Observing their forms he
      shouted, 'I'm going to Narrobourne; who may you be?'
    </p>
    <p>
      They went up to him, and revealed themselves, reminding him of the plan
      which he had himself proposed in his note, that they should meet him at
      Ivell.
    </p>
    <p>
      'By Jerry, I'd forgot it!' he said. 'Well, what do you want me to do?' His
      tone was distinctly quarrelsome.
    </p>
    <p>
      A long conversation followed, which became embittered at the first hint
      from them that he should not come to the village. The millwright drew a
      quart bottle from his pocket, and challenged them to drink if they meant
      friendly and called themselves men. Neither of the two had touched alcohol
      for years, but for once they thought it best to accept, so as not to
      needlessly provoke him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What's in it?' said Joshua.
    </p>
    <p>
      'A drop of weak gin-and-water. It won't hurt ye. Drin' from the bottle.'
      Joshua did so, and his father pushed up the bottom of the vessel so as to
      make him swallow a good deal in spite of himself. It went down into his
      stomach like molten lead.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ha, ha, that's right!' said old Halborough. 'But 'twas raw spirit-ha,
      ha!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why should you take me in so!' said Joshua, losing his self-command, try
      as he would to keep calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Because you took me in, my lad, in banishing me to that cursed country
      under pretence that it was for my good. You were a pair of hypocrites to
      say so. It was done to get rid of me-no more nor less. But, by Jerry, I'm
      a match for ye now! I'll spoil your souls for preaching. My daughter is
      going to be married to the squire here. I've heard the news-I saw it in a
      paper!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is premature-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I know it is true; and I'm her father, and I shall give her away, or
      there'll be a hell of a row, I can assure ye! Is that where the gennleman
      lives?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Joshua Halborough writhed in impotent despair. Fellmer had not yet
      positively declared himself, his mother was hardly won round; a scene with
      their father in the parish would demolish as fair a palace of hopes as was
      ever builded. The millwright rose. 'If that's where the squire lives I'm
      going to call. Just arrived from Canady with her fortune-ha, ha! I wish no
      harm to the gennleman, and the gennleman will wish no harm to me. But I
      like to take my place in the family, and stand upon my rights, and lower
      people's pride!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You've succeeded already! Where's that woman you took with you-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Woman! She was my wife as lawful as the Constitution-a sight more lawful
      than your mother was till some time after you were born!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Joshua had for many years before heard whispers that his father had
      cajoled his mother in their early acquaintance, and had made somewhat
      tardy amends; but never from his father's lips till now. It was the last
      stroke, and he could not bear it. He sank back against the hedge. 'It is
      over!' he said. 'He ruins us all!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The millwright moved on, waving his stick triumphantly, and the two
      brothers stood still. They could see his drab figure stalking along the
      path, and over his head the lights from the conservatory of Narrobourne
      House, inside which Albert Fellmer might possibly be sitting with Rosa at
      that moment, holding her hand, and asking her to share his home with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The staggering whitey-brown form, advancing to put a blot on all this, had
      been diminishing in the shade; and now suddenly disappeared beside a weir.
      There was the noise of a flounce in the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He has fallen in!' said Cornelius, starting forward to run for the place
      at which his father had vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joshua, awaking from the stupefied reverie into which he had sunk, rushed
      to the other's side before he had taken ten steps. 'Stop, stop, what are
      you thinking of?' he whispered hoarsely, grasping Cornelius's arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Pulling him out!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, yes-so am I. But-wait a moment-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But, Joshua!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Her life and happiness, you know-Cornelius-and your reputation and
      mine-and our chance of rising together, all three-'
    </p>
    <p>
      He clutched his brother's arm to the bone; and as they stood breathless
      the splashing and floundering in the weir continued; over it they saw the
      hopeful lights from the manor-house conservatory winking through the trees
      as their bare branches waved to and fro.
    </p>
    <p>
      The floundering and splashing grew weaker, and they could hear gurgling
      words: 'Help-I'm drownded! Rosie-Rosie!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'We'll go-we must save him. O Joshua!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, yes! we must!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Still they did not move, but waited, holding each other, each thinking the
      same thought. Weights of lead seemed to be affixed to their feet, which
      would no longer obey their wills. The mead became silent. Over it they
      fancied they could see figures moving in the conservatory. The air up
      there seemed to emit gentle kisses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cornelius started forward at last, and Joshua almost simultaneously. Two
      or three minutes brought them to the brink of the stream. At first they
      could see nothing in the water, though it was not so deep nor the night so
      dark but that their father's light kerseymere coat would have been visible
      if he had lain at the bottom. Joshua looked this way and that.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He has drifted into the culvert,' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Below the foot-bridge of the weir the stream suddenly narrowed to half its
      width, to pass under a barrel arch or culvert constructed for waggons to
      cross into the middle of the mead in haymaking time. It being at present
      the season of high water the arch was full to the crown, against which the
      ripples clucked every now and then. At this point he had just caught sight
      of a pale object slipping under. In a moment it was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went to the lower end, but nothing emerged. For a long time they
      tried at both ends to effect some communication with the interior, but to
      no purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      'We ought to have come sooner!' said the conscience-stricken Cornelius,
      when they were quite exhausted, and dripping wet.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I suppose we ought,' replied Joshua heavily. He perceived his father's
      walking-stick on the bank; hastily picking it up he stuck it into the mud
      among the sedge. Then they went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Shall we-say anything about this accident?' whispered Cornelius as they
      approached the door of Joshua's house.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What's the use? It can do no good. We must wait until he is found.'
    </p>
    <p>
      They went indoors and changed their clothes; after which they started for
      the manor-house, reaching it about ten o'clock. Besides their sister there
      were only three guests; an adjoining landowner and his wife, and the
      infirm old rector.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosa, although she had parted from them so recently, grasped their hands
      in an ecstatic, brimming, joyful manner, as if she had not seen them for
      years. 'You look pale,' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The brothers answered that they had had a long walk, and were somewhat
      tired. Everybody in the room seemed charged full with some sort of
      interesting knowledge: the squire's neighbour and his wife looked wisely
      around; and Fellmer himself played the part of host with a preoccupied
      bearing which approached fervour. They left at eleven, not accepting the
      carriage offered, the distance being so short and the roads dry. The
      squire came rather farther into the dark with them than he need have done,
      and wished Rosa good-night in a mysterious manner, slightly apart from the
      rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they were walking along Joshua said, with desperate attempt at
      joviality, 'Rosa, what's going on?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, I-' she began between a gasp and a bound. 'He-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never mind-if it disturbs you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She was so excited that she could not speak connectedly at first, the
      practised air which she had brought home with her having disappeared.
      Calming herself she added, 'I am not disturbed, and nothing has happened.
      Only he said he wanted to ask me something, some day; and I said never
      mind that now. He hasn't asked yet, and is coining to speak to you about
      it. He would have done so to-night, only I asked him not to be in a hurry.
      But he will come to-morrow, I am sure!'

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was summer-time, six months later, and mowers and haymakers were at
      work in the meads. The manor-house, being opposite them, frequently formed
      a peg for conversation during these operations; and the doings of the
      squire, and the squire's young wife, the curate's sister-who was at
      present the admired of most of them, and the interest of all-met with
      their due amount of criticism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosa was happy, if ever woman could be said to be so. She had not learnt
      the fate of her father, and sometimes wondered-perhaps with a sense of
      relief-why he did not write to her from his supposed home in Canada. Her
      brother Joshua had been presented to a living in a small town, shortly
      after her marriage, and Cornelius had thereupon succeeded to the vacant
      curacy of Narrobourne.
    </p>
    <p>
      These two had awaited in deep suspense the discovery of their father's
      body; and yet the discovery had not been made. Every day they expected a
      man or a boy to run up from the meads with the intelligence; but he had
      never come. Days had accumulated to weeks and months; the wedding had come
      and gone: Joshua had tolled and read himself in at his new parish; and
      never a shout of amazement over the millwright's remains.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now, in June, when they were mowing the meads, the hatches had to be
      drawn and the water let out of its channels for the convenience of the
      mowers. It was thus that the discovery was made. A man, stooping low with
      his scythe, caught a view of the culvert lengthwise, and saw something
      entangled in the recently bared weeds of its bed. A day or two after there
      was an inquest; but the body was unrecognizable. Fish and flood had been
      busy with the millwright; he had no watch or marked article which could be
      identified; and a verdict of the accidental drowning of a person unknown
      settled the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the body was found in Narrobourne parish, there it had to be buried.
      Cornelius wrote to Joshua, begging him to come and read the service, or to
      send some one; he himself could not do it. Rather than let in a stranger
      Joshua came, and silently scanned the coroner's order handed him by the
      undertaker:-
    </p>
    <p>
      'I, Henry Giles, Coroner for the Mid-Division of Outer Wessex, do hereby
      order the Burial of the Body now shown to the Inquest Jury as the Body of
      an Adult Male Person Unknown . . . ,' etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joshua Halborough got through the service in some way, and rejoined his
      brother Cornelius at his house. Neither accepted an invitation to lunch at
      their sister's; they wished to discuss parish matters together. In the
      afternoon she came down, though they had already called on her, and had
      not expected to see her again. Her bright eyes, brown hair, flowery
      bonnet, lemon-coloured gloves, and flush beauty, were like an irradiation
      into the apartment, which they in their gloom could hardly bear.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I forgot to tell you,' she said, 'of a curious thing which happened to me
      a month or two before my marriage-something which I have thought may have
      had a connection with the accident to the poor man you have buried to-day.
      It was on that evening I was at the manor-house waiting for you to fetch
      me; I was in the winter-garden with Albert, and we were sitting silent
      together, when we fancied we heard a cry. We opened the door, and while
      Albert ran to fetch his hat, leaving me standing there, the cry was
      repeated, and my excited senses made me think I heard my own name. When
      Albert came back all was silent, and we decided that it was only a drunken
      shout, and not a cry for help. We both forgot the incident, and it never
      has occurred to me till since the funeral to-day that it might have been
      this stranger's cry. The name of course was only fancy, or he might have
      had a wife or child with a name something like mine, poor man!'
    </p>
    <p>
      When she was gone the brothers were silent till Cornelius said, 'Now mark
      this, Joshua. Sooner or later she'll know.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'From one of us. Do you think human hearts are iron-cased safes, that you
      suppose we can keep this secret for ever?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, I think they are, sometimes,' said Joshua.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No. It will out. We shall tell.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What, and ruin her-kill her? Disgrace her children, and pull down the
      whole auspicious house of Fellmer about our ears? No! May I-drown where he
      was drowned before I do it! Never, never. Surely you can say the same,
      Cornelius!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Cornelius seemed fortified, and no more was said. For a long time after
      that day he did not see Joshua, and before the next year was out a son and
      heir was born to the Fellmers. The villagers rang the three bells every
      evening for a week and more, and were made merry by Mr. Fellmer's ale; and
      when the christening came on Joshua paid Narrobourne another visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among all the people who assembled on that day the brother clergymen were
      the least interested. Their minds were haunted by a spirit in kerseymere
      in the evening they walked together in the fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      'She's all right,' said Joshua. 'But here are you doing journey-work,
      Cornelius, and likely to continue at it till the end of the day, as far as
      I can see. I, too, with my petty living-what am I after all? . . . To tell
      the truth, the Church is a poor forlorn hope for people without influence,
      particularly when their enthusiasm begins to flag. A social regenerator
      has a better chance outside, where he is unhampered by dogma and
      tradition. As for me, I would rather have gone on mending mills, with my
      crust of bread and liberty.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost automatically they had bent their steps along the margin of the
      river; they now paused. They were standing on the brink of the well- known
      weir. There were the hatches, there was the culvert; they could see the
      pebbly bed of the stream through the pellucid water. The notes of the
      church-bells were audible, still jangled by the enthusiastic villagers.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why see-it was there I hid his walking-stick!' said Joshua, looking
      towards the sedge. The next moment, during a passing breeze, something
      flashed white on the spot to which the attention of Cornelius was drawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the sedge rose a straight little silver-poplar, and it was the leaves
      of this sapling which caused the flicker of whiteness.
    </p>
    <p>
      'His walking-stick has grown!' Joshua added. 'It was a rough one-cut from
      the hedge, I remember.'
    </p>
    <p>
      At every puff of wind the tree turned white, till they could not bear to
      look at it; and they walked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I see him every night,' Cornelius murmured . . . 'Ah, we read our Hebrews
      to little account, Jos! ?p??e??e sta????, a?s????? ?ataf????sa?. To have
      endured the cross, despising the shame-there lay greatness! But now I
      often feel that I should like to put an end to trouble here in this
      self-same spot.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have thought of it myself,' said Joshua.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Perhaps we shall, some day,' murmured his brother. 'Perhaps,' said Joshua
      moodily.
    </p>
    <p>
      With that contingency to consider in the silence of their nights and days
      they bent their steps homewards.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <p>
      The man who played the disturbing part in the two quiet lives hereafter
      depicted-no great man, in any sense, by the way-first had knowledge of
      them on an October evening, in the city of Melchester. He had been
      standing in the Close, vainly endeavouring to gain amid the darkness a
      glimpse of the most homogeneous pile of mediaval architecture in England,
      which towered and tapered from the damp and level sward in front of him.
      While he stood the presence of the Cathedral walls was revealed rather by
      the ear than by the eyes; he could not see them, but they reflected
      sharply a roar of sound which entered the Close by a street leading from
      the city square, and, falling upon the building, was flung back upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He postponed till the morrow his attempt to examine the deserted edifice,
      and turned his attention to the noise. It was compounded of steam
      barrel-organs, the clanging of gongs, the ringing of hand-bells, the clack
      of rattles, and the undistinguishable shouts of men. A lurid light hung in
      the air in the direction of the tumult. Thitherward he went, passing under
      the arched gateway, along a straight street, and into the square.
    </p>
    <p>
      He might have searched Europe over for a greater contrast between
      juxtaposed scenes. The spectacle was that of the eighth chasm of the
      Inferno as to colour and flame, and, as to mirth, a development of the
      Homeric heaven. A smoky glare, of the complexion of brass-filings,
      ascended from the fiery tongues of innumerable naphtha lamps affixed to
      booths, stalls, and other temporary erections which crowded the spacious
      market-square. In front of this irradiation scores of human figures, more
      or less in profile, were darting athwart and across, up, down, and around,
      like gnats against a sunset.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their motions were so rhythmical that they seemed to be moved by
      machinery. And it presently appeared that they were moved by machinery
      indeed; the figures being those of the patrons of swings, see-saws,
      flying-leaps, above all of the three steam roundabouts which occupied the
      centre of the position. It was from the latter that the din of
      steam-organs came.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throbbing humanity in full light was, on second thoughts, better than
      architecture in the dark. The young man, lighting a short pipe, and
      putting his hat on one side and one hand in his pocket, to throw himself
      into harmony with his new environment, drew near to the largest and most
      patronized of the steam circuses, as the roundabouts were called by their
      owners. This was one of brilliant finish, and it was now in full
      revolution. The musical instrument around which and to whose tones the
      riders revolved, directed its trumpet-mouths of brass upon the young man,
      and the long plate-glass mirrors set at angles, which revolved with the
      machine, flashed the gyrating personages and hobby horses
      kaleidoscopically into his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      It could now be seen that he was unlike the majority of the crowd. A
      gentlemanly young fellow, one of the species found in large towns only,
      and London particularly, built on delicate lines, well, though not
      fashionably dressed, he appeared to belong to the professional class; he
      had nothing square or practical about his look, much that was curvilinear
      and sensuous. Indeed, some would have called him a man not altogether
      typical of the middle-class male of a century wherein sordid ambition is
      the master-passion that seems to be taking the time-honoured place of
      love.
    </p>
    <p>
      The revolving figures passed before his eyes with an unexpected and quiet
      grace in a throng whose natural movements did not suggest gracefulness or
      quietude as a rule. By some contrivance there was imparted to each of the
      hobby-horses a motion which was really the triumph and perfection of
      roundabout inventiveness-a galloping rise and fall, so timed that, of each
      pair of steeds, one was on the spring while the other was on the pitch.
      The riders were quite fascinated by these equine undulations in this most
      delightful holiday-game of our times. There were riders as young as six,
      and as old as sixty years, with every age between. At first it was
      difficult to catch a personality, but by and by the observer's eyes
      centred on the prettiest girl out of the several pretty ones revolving.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not that one with the light frock and light hat whom he had been at
      first attracted by; no, it was the one with the black cape, grey skirt,
      light gloves and-no, not even she, but the one behind her; she with the
      crimson skirt, dark jacket, brown hat and brown gloves. Unmistakably that
      was the prettiest girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having finally selected her, this idle spectator studied her as well as he
      was able during each of her brief transits across his visual field. She
      was absolutely unconscious of everything save the act of riding: her
      features were rapt in an ecstatic dreaminess; for the moment she did not
      know her age or her history or her lineaments, much less her troubles. He
      himself was full of vague latter-day glooms and popular melancholies, and
      it was a refreshing sensation to behold this young thing then and there,
      absolutely as happy as if she were in a Paradise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dreading the moment when the inexorable stoker, grimily lurking behind the
      glittering rococo-work, should decide that this set of riders had had
      their pennyworth, and bring the whole concern of steam-engine, horses,
      mirrors, trumpets, drums, cymbals, and such-like to pause and silence, he
      waited for her every reappearance, glancing indifferently over the
      intervening forms, including the two plainer girls, the old woman and
      child, the two youngsters, the newly-married couple, the old man with a
      clay pipe, the sparkish youth with a ring, the young ladies in the
      chariot, the pair of journeyman-carpenters, and others, till his select
      country beauty followed on again in her place. He had never seen a fairer
      product of nature, and at each round she made a deeper mark in his
      sentiments. The stoppage then came, and the sighs of the riders were
      audible.
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved round to the place at which he reckoned she would alight; but she
      retained her seat. The empty saddles began to refill, and she plainly was
      deciding to have another turn. The young man drew up to the side of her
      steed, and pleasantly asked her if she had enjoyed her ride.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O yes!' she said, with dancing eyes. 'It has been quite unlike anything I
      have ever felt in my life before!'
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not difficult to fall into conversation with her. Unreserved-too
      unreserved-by nature, she was not experienced enough to be reserved by
      art, and after a little coaxing she answered his remarks readily. She had
      come to live in Melchester from a village on the Great Plain, and this was
      the first time that she had ever seen a steam-circus; she could not
      understand how such wonderful machines were made. She had come to the city
      on the invitation of Mrs. Harnham, who had taken her into her household to
      train her as a servant, if she showed any aptitude. Mrs. Harnham was a
      young lady who before she married had been Miss Edith White, living in the
      country near the speaker's cottage; she was now very kind to her through
      knowing her in childhood so well. She was even taking the trouble to
      educate her. Mrs. Harnham was the only friend she had in the world, and
      being without children had wished to have her near her in preference to
      anybody else, though she had only lately come; allowed her to do almost as
      she liked, and to have a holiday whenever she asked for it. The husband of
      this kind young lady was a rich wine- merchant of the town, but Mrs.
      Harnham did not care much about him. In the daytime you could see the
      house from where they were talking. She, the speaker, liked Melchester
      better than the lonely country, and she was going to have a new hat for
      next Sunday that was to cost fifteen and ninepence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she inquired of her acquaintance where he lived, and he told her in
      London, that ancient and smoky city, where everybody lived who lived at
      all, and died because they could not live there. He came into Wessex two
      or three times a year for professional reasons; he had arrived from
      Wintoncester yesterday, and was going on into the next county in a day or
      two. For one thing he did like the country better than the town, and it
      was because it contained such girls as herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the pleasure-machine started again, and, to the light-hearted girl,
      the figure of the handsome young man, the market-square with its lights
      and crowd, the houses beyond, and the world at large, began moving round
      as before, countermoving in the revolving mirrors on her right hand, she
      being as it were the fixed point in an undulating, dazzling, lurid
      universe, in which loomed forward most prominently of all the form of her
      late interlocutor. Each time that she approached the half of her orbit
      that lay nearest him they gazed at each other with smiles, and with that
      unmistakable expression which means so little at the moment, yet so often
      leads up to passion, heart-ache, union, disunion, devotion,
      overpopulation, drudgery, content, resignation, despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the horses slowed anew he stepped to her side and proposed another
      heat. 'Hang the expense for once,' he said. 'I'll pay!'
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed till the tears came.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why do you laugh, dear?' said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Because-you are so genteel that you must have plenty of money, and only
      say that for fun!' she returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ha-ha!' laughed the young man in unison, and gallantly producing his
      money she was enabled to whirl on again.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he stood smiling there in the motley crowd, with his pipe in his hand,
      and clad in the rough pea-jacket and wideawake that he had put on for his
      stroll, who would have supposed him to be Charles Bradford Raye, Esquire,
      stuff-gownsman, educated at Wintoncester, called to the Bar at
      Lincoln's-Inn, now going the Western Circuit, merely detained in
      Melchester by a small arbitration after his brethren had moved on to the
      next county-town?

      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <p>
      The square was overlooked from its remoter corner by the house of which
      the young girl had spoken, a dignified residence of considerable size,
      having several windows on each floor. Inside one of these, on the first
      floor, the apartment being a large drawing-room, sat a lady, in appearance
      from twenty-eight to thirty years of age. The blinds were still undrawn,
      and the lady was absently surveying the weird scene without, her cheek
      resting on her hand. The room was unlit from within, but enough of the
      glare from the market-place entered it to reveal the lady's face. She was
      what is called an interesting creature rather than a handsome woman;
      dark-eyed, thoughtful, and with sensitive lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man sauntered into the room from behind and came forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, Edith, I didn't see you,' he said. 'Why are you sitting here in the
      dark?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am looking at the fair,' replied the lady in a languid voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh? Horrid nuisance every year! I wish it could be put a stop to'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I like it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'H'm. There's no accounting for taste.'
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment he gazed from the window with her, for politeness sake, and
      then went out again.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes she rang.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hasn't Anna come in?' asked Mrs. Harnham.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No m'm.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She ought to be in by this time. I meant her to go for ten minutes only.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Shall I go and look for her, m'm?' said the house-maid alertly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No. It is not necessary: she is a good girl and will come soon.'
    </p>
    <p>
      However, when the servant had gone Mrs. Harnham arose, went up to her
      room, cloaked and bonneted herself, and proceeded downstairs, where she
      found her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I want to see the fair,' she said; 'and I am going to look for Anna. I
      have made myself responsible for her, and must see she comes to no harm.
      She ought to be indoors. Will you come with me?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, she's all right. I saw her on one of those whirligig things, talking
      to her young man as I came in. But I'll go if you wish, though I'd rather
      go a hundred miles the other way.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then please do so. I shall come to no harm alone.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She left the house and entered the crowd which thronged the market- place,
      where she soon discovered Anna, seated on the revolving horse. As soon as
      it stopped Mrs. Harnham advanced and said severely, 'Anna, how can you be
      such a wild girl? You were only to be out for ten minutes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Anna looked blank, and the young man, who had dropped into the background,
      came to her assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Please don't blame her,' he said politely. 'It is my fault that she has
      stayed. She looked so graceful on the horse that I induced her to go round
      again. I assure you that she has been quite safe.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'In that case I'll leave her in your hands,' said Mrs. Harnham, turning to
      retrace her steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this for the moment it was not so easy to do. Something had attracted
      the crowd to a spot in their rear, and the wine-merchant's wife, caught by
      its sway, found herself pressed against Anna's acquaintance without power
      to move away. Their faces were within a few inches of each other, his
      breath fanned her cheek as well as Anna's. They could do no other than
      smile at the accident; but neither spoke, and each waited passively. Mrs.
      Harnham then felt a man's hand clasping her fingers, and from the look of
      consciousness on the young fellow's face she knew the hand to be his: she
      also knew that from the position of the girl he had no other thought than
      that the imprisoned hand was Anna's. What prompted her to refrain from
      undeceiving him she could hardly tell. Not content with holding the hand,
      he playfully slipped two of his fingers inside her glove, against her
      palm. Thus matters continued till the pressure lessened; but several
      minutes passed before the crowd thinned sufficiently to allow Mrs. Harnham
      to withdraw.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How did they get to know each other, I wonder?' she mused as she
      retreated. 'Anna is really very forward-and he very wicked and nice.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She was so gently stirred with the stranger's manner and voice, with the
      tenderness of his idle touch, that instead of re-entering the house she
      turned back again and observed the pair from a screened nook. Really she
      argued (being little less impulsive than Anna herself) it was very
      excusable in Anna to encourage him, however she might have contrived to
      make his acquaintance; he was so gentlemanly, so fascinating, had such
      beautiful eyes. The thought that he was several years her junior produced
      a reasonless sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the couple turned from the roundabout towards the door of Mrs.
      Harnham's house, and the young man could be heard saying that he would
      accompany her home. Anna, then, had found a lover, apparently a very
      devoted one. Mrs. Harnham was quite interested in him. When they drew near
      the door of the wine-merchant's house, a comparatively deserted spot by
      this time, they stood invisible for a little while in the shadow of a
      wall, where they separated, Anna going on to the entrance, and her
      acquaintance returning across the square.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Anna,' said Mrs. Harnham, coming up. 'I've been looking at you! That
      young man kissed you at parting I am almost sure.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well,' stammered Anna; 'he said, if I didn't mind-it would do me no harm,
      and, and, him a great deal of good!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, I thought so! And he was a stranger till to-night?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes ma'am.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yet I warrant you told him your name and every thing about yourself?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He asked me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But he didn't tell you his?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes ma'am, he did!' cried Anna victoriously. 'It is Charles Bradford, of
      London.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, if he's respectable, of course I've nothing to say against your
      knowing him,' remarked her mistress, prepossessed, in spite of general
      principles, in the young man's favour. 'But I must reconsider all that, if
      he attempts to renew your acquaintance. A country-bred girl like you, who
      has never lived in Melchester till this month, who had hardly ever seen a
      black-coated man till you came here, to be so sharp as to capture a young
      Londoner like him!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I didn't capture him. I didn't do anything,' said Anna, in confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she was indoors and alone Mrs. Harnham thought what a well-bred and
      chivalrous young man Anna's companion had seemed. There had been a magic
      in his wooing touch of her hand; and she wondered how he had come to be
      attracted by the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning the emotional Edith Harnham went to the usual week-day
      service in Melchester cathedral. In crossing the Close through the fog she
      again perceived him who had interested her the previous evening, gazing up
      thoughtfully at the high-piled architecture of the nave: and as soon as
      she had taken her seat he entered and sat down in a stall opposite hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not particularly heed her; but Mrs. Harnham was continually
      occupying her eyes with him, and wondered more than ever what had
      attracted him in her unfledged maid-servant. The mistress was almost as
      unaccustomed as the maiden herself to the end-of-the-age young man, or she
      might have wondered less. Raye, having looked about him awhile, left
      abruptly, without regard to the service that was proceeding; and Mrs.
      Harnham-lonely, impressionable creature that she was-took no further
      interest in praising the Lord. She wished she had married a London man who
      knew the subtleties of love-making as they were evidently known to him who
      had mistakenly caressed her hand.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <p>
      The calendar at Melchester had been light, occupying the court only a few
      hours; and the assizes at Casterbridge, the next county-town on the
      Western Circuit, having no business for Raye, he had not gone thither. At
      the next town after that they did not open till the following Monday,
      trials to begin on Tuesday morning. In the natural order of things Raye
      would have arrived at the latter place on Monday afternoon; but it was not
      till the middle of Wednesday that his gown and grey wig, curled in tiers,
      in the best fashion of Assyrian bas-reliefs, were seen blowing and bobbing
      behind him as he hastily walked up the High Street from his lodgings. But
      though he entered the assize building there was nothing for him to do, and
      sitting at the blue baize table in the well of the court, he mended pens
      with a mind far away from the case in progress. Thoughts of unpremeditated
      conduct, of which a week earlier he would not have believed himself
      capable, threw him into a mood of dissatisfied depression.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had contrived to see again the pretty rural maiden Anna, the day after
      the fair, had walked out of the city with her to the earthworks of Old
      Melchester, and feeling a violent fancy for her, had remained in
      Melchester all Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday; by persuasion obtaining walks
      and meetings with the girl six or seven times during the interval; had in
      brief won her, body and soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      He supposed it must have been owing to the seclusion in which he had lived
      of late in town that he had given way so unrestrainedly to a passion for
      an artless creature whose inexperience had, from the first, led her to
      place herself unreservedly in his hands. Much he deplored trifling with
      her feelings for the sake of a passing desire; and he could only hope that
      she might not live to suffer on his account.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had begged him to come to her again; entreated him; wept. He had
      promised that he would do so, and he meant to carry out that promise. He
      could not desert her now. Awkward as such unintentional connections were,
      the interspace of a hundred miles-which to a girl of her limited
      capabilities was like a thousand-would effectually hinder this summer
      fancy from greatly encumbering his life; while thought of her simple love
      might do him the negative good of keeping him from idle pleasures in town
      when he wished to work hard. His circuit journeys would take him to
      Melchester three or four times a year; and then he could always see her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pseudonym, or rather partial name, that he had given her as his before
      knowing how far the acquaintance was going to carry him, had been spoken
      on the spur of the moment, without any ulterior intention whatever. He had
      not afterwards disturbed Anna's error, but on leaving her he had felt
      bound to give her an address at a stationer's not far from his chambers,
      at which she might write to him under the initials 'C. B.'
    </p>
    <p>
      In due time Raye returned to his London abode, having called at Melchester
      on his way and spent a few additional hours with his fascinating child of
      nature. In town he lived monotonously every day. Often he and his rooms
      were enclosed by a tawny fog from all the world besides, and when he
      lighted the gas to read or write by, his situation seemed so unnatural
      that he would look into the fire and think of that trusting girl at
      Melchester again and again. Often, oppressed by absurd fondness for her,
      he would enter the dim religious nave of the Law Courts by the north door,
      elbow other juniors habited like himself, and like him unretained; edge
      himself into this or that crowded court where a sensational case was going
      on, just as if he were in it, though the police officers at the door knew
      as well as he knew himself that he had no more concern with the business
      in hand than the patient idlers at the gallery-door outside, who had
      waited to enter since eight in the morning because, like him, they
      belonged to the classes that live on expectation. But he would do these
      things to no purpose, and think how greatly the characters in such scenes
      contrasted with the pink and breezy Anna.
    </p>
    <p>
      An unexpected feature in that peasant maiden's conduct was that she had
      not as yet written to him, though he had told her she might do so if she
      wished. Surely a young creature had never before been so reticent in such
      circumstances. At length he sent her a brief line, positively requesting
      her to write. There was no answer by the return post, but the day after a
      letter in a neat feminine hand, and bearing the Melchester post-mark, was
      handed to him by the stationer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact alone of its arrival was sufficient to satisfy his imaginative
      sentiment. He was not anxious to open the epistle, and in truth did not
      begin to read it for nearly half-an-hour, anticipating readily its terms
      of passionate retrospect and tender adjuration. When at last he turned his
      feet to the fireplace and unfolded the sheet, he was surprised and pleased
      to find that neither extravagance nor vulgarity was there. It was the most
      charming little missive he had ever received from woman. To be sure the
      language was simple and the ideas were slight; but it was so
      self-possessed; so purely that of a young girl who felt her womanhood to
      be enough for her dignity that he read it through twice. Four sides were
      filled, and a few lines written across, after the fashion of former days;
      the paper, too, was common, and not of the latest shade and surface. But
      what of those things? He had received letters from women who were fairly
      called ladies, but never so sensible, so human a letter as this. He could
      not single out any one sentence and say it was at all remarkable or
      clever; the ensemble of the letter it was which won him; and beyond the
      one request that he would write or come to her again soon there was
      nothing to show her sense of a claim upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      To write again and develop a correspondence was the last thing Raye would
      have preconceived as his conduct in such a situation; yet he did send a
      short, encouraging line or two, signed with his pseudonym, in which he
      asked for another letter, and cheeringly promised that he would try to see
      her again on some near day, and would never forget how much they had been
      to each other during their short acquaintance.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      To return now to the moment at which Anna, at Melchester, had received
      Raye's letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been put into her own hand by the postman on his morning rounds.
      She flushed down to her neck on receipt of it, and turned it over and
      over. 'It is mine?' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, yes, can't you see it is?' said the postman, smiling as he guessed
      the nature of the document and the cause of the confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O yes, of course!' replied Anna, looking at the letter, forcedly
      tittering, and blushing still more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her look of embarrassment did not leave her with the postman's departure.
      She opened the envelope, kissed its contents, put away the letter in her
      pocket, and remained musing till her eyes filled with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes later she carried up a cup of tea to Mrs. Harnham in her
      bed-chamber. Anna's mistress looked at her, and said: 'How dismal you seem
      this morning, Anna. What's the matter?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'm not dismal, I'm glad; only I-' She stopped to stifle a sob.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I've got a letter-and what good is it to me, if I can't read a word in
      it!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, I'll read it, child, if necessary.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But this is from somebody-I don't want anybody to read it but myself!'
      Anna murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I shall not tell anybody. Is it from that young man?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I think so.' Anna slowly produced the letter, saying: 'Then will you read
      it to me, ma'am?'
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the secret of Anna's embarrassment and flutterings. She could
      neither read nor write. She had grown up under the care of an aunt by
      marriage, at one of the lonely hamlets on the Great Mid-Wessex Plain
      where, even in days of national education, there had been no school within
      a distance of two miles. Her aunt was an ignorant woman; there had been
      nobody to investigate Anna's circumstances, nobody to care about her
      learning the rudiments; though, as often in such cases, she had been well
      fed and clothed and not unkindly treated. Since she had come to live at
      Melchester with Mrs. Harnham, the latter, who took a kindly interest in
      the girl, had taught her to speak correctly, in which accomplishment Anna
      showed considerable readiness, as is not unusual with the illiterate; and
      soon became quite fluent in the use of her mistress's phraseology. Mrs.
      Harnham also insisted upon her getting a spelling and copy book, and
      beginning to practise in these. Anna was slower in this branch of her
      education, and meanwhile here was the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edith Harnham's large dark eyes expressed some interest in the contents,
      though, in her character of mere interpreter, she threw into her tone as
      much as she could of mechanical passiveness. She read the short epistle on
      to its concluding sentence, which idly requested Anna to send him a tender
      answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now-you'll do it for me, won't you, dear mistress?' said Anna eagerly.
      'And you'll do it as well as ever you can, please? Because I couldn't bear
      him to think I am not able to do it myself. I should sink into the earth
      with shame if he knew that!'
    </p>
    <p>
      From some words in the letter Mrs. Harnham was led to ask questions, and
      the answers she received confirmed her suspicions. Deep concern filled
      Edith's heart at perceiving how the girl had committed her happiness to
      the issue of this new-sprung attachment. She blamed herself for not
      interfering in a flirtation which had resulted so seriously for the poor
      little creature in her charge; though at the time of seeing the pair
      together she had a feeling that it was hardly within her province to nip
      young affection in the bud. However, what was done could not be undone,
      and it behoved her now, as Anna's only protector, to help her as much as
      she could. To Anna's eager request that she, Mrs. Harnham, should compose
      and write the answer to this young London man's letter, she felt bound to
      accede, to keep alive his attachment to the girl if possible; though in
      other circumstances she might have suggested the cook as an amanuensis.
    </p>
    <p>
      A tender reply was thereupon concocted, and set down in Edith Harnham's
      hand. This letter it had been which Raye had received and delighted in.
      Written in the presence of Anna it certainly was, and on Anna's humble
      note-paper, and in a measure indited by the young girl; but the life, the
      spirit, the individuality, were Edith Harnham's.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Won't you at least put your name yourself?' she said. 'You can manage to
      write that by this time?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, no,' said Anna, shrinking back. 'I should do it so bad. He'd be
      ashamed of me, and never see me again!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The note, so prettily requesting another from him, had, as we have seen,
      power enough in its pages to bring one. He declared it to be such a
      pleasure to hear from her that she must write every week. The same process
      of manufacture was accordingly repeated by Anna and her mistress, and
      continued for several weeks in succession; each letter being penned and
      suggested by Edith, the girl standing by; the answer read and commented on
      by Edith, Anna standing by and listening again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late on a winter evening, after the dispatch of the sixth letter, Mrs.
      Harnham was sitting alone by the remains of her fire. Her husband had
      retired to bed, and she had fallen into that fixity of musing which takes
      no count of hour or temperature. The state of mind had been brought about
      in Edith by a strange thing which she had done that day. For the first
      time since Raye's visit Anna had gone to stay over a night or two with her
      cottage friends on the Plain, and in her absence had arrived, out of its
      time, a letter from Raye. To this Edith had replied on her own
      responsibility, from the depths of her own heart, without waiting for her
      maid's collaboration. The luxury of writing to him what would be known to
      no consciousness but his was great, and she had indulged herself therein.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why was it a luxury?
    </p>
    <p>
      Edith Harnham led a lonely life. Influenced by the belief of the British
      parent that a bad marriage with its aversions is better than free
      womanhood with its interests, dignity, and leisure, she had consented to
      marry the elderly wine-merchant as a pis aller, at the age of
      seven-and-twenty-some three years before this date-to find afterwards that
      she had made a mistake. That contract had left her still a woman whose
      deeper nature had never been stirred.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was now clearly realizing that she had become possessed to the bottom
      of her soul with the image of a man to whom she was hardly so much as a
      name. From the first he had attracted her by his looks and voice; by his
      tender touch; and, with these as generators, the writing of letter after
      letter and the reading of their soft answers had insensibly developed on
      her side an emotion which fanned his; till there had resulted a magnetic
      reciprocity between the correspondents, notwithstanding that one of them
      wrote in a character not her own. That he had been able to seduce another
      woman in two days was his crowning though unrecognized fascination for her
      as the she-animal.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were her own impassioned and pent-up ideas-lowered to monosyllabic
      phraseology in order to keep up the disguise-that Edith put into letters
      signed with another name, much to the shallow Anna's delight, who,
      unassisted, could not for the world have conceived such pretty fancies for
      winning him, even had she been able to write them. Edith found that it was
      these, her own foisted-in sentiments, to which the young barrister mainly
      responded. The few sentences occasionally added from Anna's own lips made
      apparently no impression upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter-writing in her absence Anna never discovered; but on her return
      the next morning she declared she wished to see her lover about something
      at once, and begged Mrs. Harnham to ask him to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a strange anxiety in her manner which did not escape Mrs.
      Harnham, and ultimately resolved itself into a flood of tears. Sinking
      down at Edith's knees, she made confession that the result of her
      relations with her lover it would soon become necessary to disclose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edith Harnham was generous enough to be very far from inclined to cast
      Anna adrift at this conjuncture. No true woman ever is so inclined from
      her own personal point of view, however prompt she may be in taking such
      steps to safeguard those dear to her. Although she had written to Raye so
      short a time previously, she instantly penned another Anna-note hinting
      clearly though delicately the state of affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Raye replied by a hasty line to say how much he was affected by her news:
      he felt that he must run down to see her almost immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a week later the girl came to her mistress's room with another note,
      which on being read informed her that after all he could not find time for
      the journey. Anna was broken with grief; but by Mrs. Harnham's counsel
      strictly refrained from hurling at him the reproaches and bitterness
      customary from young women so situated. One thing was imperative: to keep
      the young man's romantic interest in her alive. Rather therefore did
      Edith, in the name of her protegee, request him on no account to be
      distressed about the looming event, and not to inconvenience himself to
      hasten down. She desired above everything to be no weight upon him in his
      career, no clog upon his high activities. She had wished him to know what
      had befallen: he was to dismiss it again from his mind. Only he must write
      tenderly as ever, and when he should come again on the spring circuit it
      would be soon enough to discuss what had better be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may well be supposed that Anna's own feelings had not been quite in
      accord with these generous expressions; but the mistress's judgment had
      ruled, and Anna had acquiesced. 'All I want is that niceness you can so
      well put into your letters, my dear, dear mistress, and that I can't for
      the life o' me make up out of my own head; though I mean the same thing
      and feel it exactly when you've written it down!'
    </p>
    <p>
      When the letter had been sent off, and Edith Harnham was left alone, she
      bowed herself on the back of her chair and wept.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I wish it was mine-I wish it was!' she murmured. 'Yet how can I say such
      a wicked thing!'

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <p>
      The letter moved Raye considerably when it reached him. The intelligence
      itself had affected him less than her unexpected manner of treating him in
      relation to it. The absence of any word of reproach, the devotion to his
      interests, the self-sacrifice apparent in every line, all made up a
      nobility of character that he had never dreamt of finding in womankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      'God forgive me!' he said tremulously. 'I have been a wicked wretch. I did
      not know she was such a treasure as this!'
    </p>
    <p>
      He reassured her instantly; declaring that he would not of course desert
      her, that he would provide a home for her somewhere. Meanwhile she was to
      stay where she was as long as her mistress would allow her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a misfortune supervened in this direction. Whether an inkling of
      Anna's circumstances reached the knowledge of Mrs. Harnham's husband or
      not cannot be said, but the girl was compelled, in spite of Edith's
      entreaties, to leave the house. By her own choice she decided to go back
      for a while to the cottage on the Plain. This arrangement led to a
      consultation as to how the correspondence should be carried on; and in the
      girl's inability to continue personally what had been begun in her name,
      and in the difficulty of their acting in concert as heretofore, she
      requested Mrs. Harnham-the only well-to-do friend she had in the world-to
      receive the letters and reply to them off-hand, sending them on afterwards
      to herself on the Plain, where she might at least get some neighbour to
      read them to her, if a trustworthy one could be met with. Anna and her box
      then departed for the Plain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus it befel that Edith Harnham found herself in the strange position of
      having to correspond, under no supervision by the real woman, with a man
      not her husband, in terms which were virtually those of a wife, concerning
      a condition that was not Edith's at all; the man being one for whom,
      mainly through the sympathies involved in playing this part, she secretly
      cherished a predilection, subtle and imaginative truly, but strong and
      absorbing. She opened each letter, read it as if intended for herself, and
      replied from the promptings of her own heart and no other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout this correspondence, carried on in the girl's absence, the
      high-strung Edith Harnham lived in the ecstasy of fancy; the vicarious
      intimacy engendered such a flow of passionateness as was never exceeded.
      For conscience' sake Edith at first sent on each of his letters to Anna,
      and even rough copies of her replies; but later on these so-called copies
      were much abridged, and many letters on both sides were not sent on at
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though selfish, and, superficially at least, infested with the self-
      indulgent vices of artificial society, there was a substratum of honesty
      and fairness in Raye's character. He had really a tender regard for the
      country girl, and it grew more tender than ever when he found her
      apparently capable of expressing the deepest sensibilities in the simplest
      words. He meditated, he wavered; and finally resolved to consult his
      sister, a maiden lady much older than himself, of lively sympathies and
      good intent. In making this confidence he showed her some of the letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      'She seems fairly educated,' Miss Raye observed. 'And bright in ideas. She
      expresses herself with a taste that must be innate.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. She writes very prettily, doesn't she, thanks to these elementary
      schools?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'One is drawn out towards her, in spite of one's self, poor thing.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The upshot of the discussion was that though he had not been directly
      advised to do it, Raye wrote, in his real name, what he would never have
      decided to write on his own responsibility; namely that he could not live
      without her, and would come down in the spring and shelve her looming
      difficulty by marrying her.
    </p>
    <p>
      This bold acceptance of the situation was made known to Anna by Mrs.
      Harnham driving out immediately to the cottage on the Plain. Anna jumped
      for joy like a little child. And poor, crude directions for answering
      appropriately were given to Edith Harnham, who on her return to the city
      carried them out with warm intensification.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O!' she groaned, as she threw down the pen. 'Anna-poor good little
      fool-hasn't intelligence enough to appreciate him! How should she? While
      I-don't bear his child!'
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now February. The correspondence had continued altogether for four
      months; and the next letter from Raye contained incidentally a statement
      of his position and prospects. He said that in offering to wed her he had,
      at first, contemplated the step of retiring from a profession which
      hitherto had brought him very slight emolument, and which, to speak
      plainly, he had thought might be difficult of practice after his union
      with her. But the unexpected mines of brightness and warmth that her
      letters had disclosed to be lurking in her sweet nature had led him to
      abandon that somewhat sad prospect. He felt sure that, with her powers of
      development, after a little private training in the social forms of London
      under his supervision, and a little help from a governess if necessary,
      she would make as good a professional man's wife as could be desired, even
      if he should rise to the woolsack. Many a Lord Chancellor's wife had been
      less intuitively a lady than she had shown herself to be in her lines to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O-poor fellow, poor fellow!' mourned Edith Harnham.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her distress now raged as high as her infatuation. It was she who had
      wrought him to this pitch-to a marriage which meant his ruin; yet she
      could not, in mercy to her maid, do anything to hinder his plan. Anna was
      coming to Melchester that week, but she could hardly show the girl this
      last reply from the young man; it told too much of the second
      individuality that had usurped the place of the first.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anna came, and her mistress took her into her own room for privacy. Anna
      began by saying with some anxiety that she was glad the wedding was so
      near.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O Anna!' replied Mrs. Harnham. 'I think we must tell him all-that I have
      been doing your writing for you?-lest he should not know it till after you
      become his wife, and it might lead to dissension and recriminations-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O mis'ess, dear mis'ess-please don't tell him now!' cried Anna in
      distress. 'If you were to do it, perhaps he would not marry me; and what
      should I do then? It would be terrible what would come to me! And I am
      getting on with my writing, too. I have brought with me the copybook you
      were so good as to give me, and I practise every day, and though it is so,
      so hard, I shall do it well at last, I believe, if I keep on trying.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Edith looked at the copybook. The copies had been set by herself, and such
      progress as the girl had made was in the way of grotesque facsimile of her
      mistress's hand. But even if Edith's flowing caligraphy were reproduced
      the inspiration would be another thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You do it so beautifully,' continued Anna, 'and say all that I want to
      say so much better than I could say it, that I do hope you won't leave me
      in the lurch just now!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very well,' replied the other. 'But I-but I thought I ought not to go
      on!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Her strong desire to confide her sentiments led Edith to answer truly:
    </p>
    <p>
      'Because of its effect upon me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But it can't have any!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, child?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Because you are married already!' said Anna with lucid simplicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of course it can't,' said her mistress hastily; yet glad, despite her
      conscience, that two or three outpourings still remained to her. 'But you
      must concentrate your attention on writing your name as I write it here.'

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Soon Raye wrote about the wedding. Having decided to make the best of what
      he feared was a piece of romantic folly, he had acquired more zest for the
      grand experiment. He wished the ceremony to be in London, for greater
      privacy. Edith Harnham would have preferred it at Melchester; Anna was
      passive. His reasoning prevailed, and Mrs. Harnham threw herself with
      mournful zeal into the preparations for Anna's departure. In a last
      desperate feeling that she must at every hazard be in at the death of her
      dream, and see once again the man who by a species of telepathy had
      exercised such an influence on her, she offered to go up with Anna and be
      with her through the ceremony-'to see the end of her,' as her mistress put
      it with forced gaiety; an offer which the girl gratefully accepted; for
      she had no other friend capable of playing the part of companion and
      witness, in the presence of a gentlemanly bridegroom, in such a way as not
      to hasten an opinion that he had made an irremediable social blunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a muddy morning in March when Raye alighted from a four-wheel cab
      at the door of a registry-office in the S.W. district of London, and
      carefully handed down Anna and her companion Mrs. Harnham. Anna looked
      attractive in the somewhat fashionable clothes which Mrs. Harnham had
      helped her to buy, though not quite so attractive as, an innocent child,
      she had appeared in her country gown on the back of the wooden horse at
      Melchester Fair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Harnham had come up this morning by an early train, and a young man-a
      friend of Raye's-having met them at the door, all four entered the
      registry-office together. Till an hour before this time Raye had never
      known the wine-merchant's wife, except at that first casual encounter, and
      in the flutter of the performance before them he had little opportunity
      for more than a brief acquaintance. The contract of marriage at a registry
      is soon got through; but somehow, during its progress, Raye discovered a
      strange and secret gravitation between himself and Anna's friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      The formalities of the wedding-or rather ratification of a previous
      union-being concluded, the four went in one cab to Raye's lodgings, newly
      taken in a new suburb in preference to a house, the rent of which he could
      ill afford just then. Here Anna cut the little cake which Raye had bought
      at a pastrycook's on his way home from Lincoln's Inn the night before. But
      she did not do much besides. Raye's friend was obliged to depart almost
      immediately, and when he had left the only ones virtually present were
      Edith and Raye who exchanged ideas with much animation. The conversation
      was indeed theirs only, Anna being as a domestic animal who humbly heard
      but understood not. Raye seemed startled in awakening to this fact, and
      began to feel dissatisfied with her inadequacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, more disappointed than he cared to own, he said, 'Mrs. Harnham,
      my darling is so flurried that she doesn't know what she is doing or
      saying. I see that after this event a little quietude will be necessary
      before she gives tongue to that tender philosophy which she used to treat
      me to in her letters.'
    </p>
    <p>
      They had planned to start early that afternoon for Knollsea, to spend the
      few opening days of their married life there, and as the hour for
      departure was drawing near Raye asked his wife if she would go to the
      writing-desk in the next room and scribble a little note to his sister,
      who had been unable to attend through indisposition, informing her that
      the ceremony was over, thanking her for her little present, and hoping to
      know her well now that she was the writer's sister as well as Charles's.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Say it in the pretty poetical way you know so well how to adopt,' he
      added, 'for I want you particularly to win her, and both of you to be dear
      friends.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Anna looked uneasy, but departed to her task, Raye remaining to talk to
      their guest. Anna was a long while absent, and her husband suddenly rose
      and went to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found her still bending over the writing-table, with tears brimming up
      in her eyes; and he looked down upon the sheet of note-paper with some
      interest, to discover with what tact she had expressed her good- will in
      the delicate circumstances. To his surprise she had progressed but a few
      lines, in the characters and spelling of a child of eight, and with the
      ideas of a goose.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Anna,' he said, staring; 'what's this?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It only means-that I can't do it any better!' she answered, through her
      tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Eh? Nonsense!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I can't!' she insisted, with miserable, sobbing hardihood. 'I-I-didn't
      write those letters, Charles! I only told her what to write! And not
      always that! But I am learning, O so fast, my dear, dear husband! And
      you'll forgive me, won't you, for not telling you before?' She slid to her
      knees, abjectly clasped his waist and laid her face against him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood a few moments, raised her, abruptly turned, and shut the door
      upon her, rejoining Edith in the drawing-room. She saw that something
      untoward had been discovered, and their eyes remained fixed on each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do I guess rightly?' he asked, with wan quietude. 'You were her scribe
      through all this?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It was necessary,' said Edith.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Did she dictate every word you ever wrote to me?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not every word.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'In fact, very little?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very little.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You wrote a great part of those pages every week from your own
      conceptions, though in her name!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Perhaps you wrote many of the letters when you were alone, without
      communication with her?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I did.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned to the bookcase, and leant with his hand over his face; and
      Edith, seeing his distress, became white as a sheet.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You have deceived me-ruined me!' he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, don't say it!' she cried in her anguish, jumping up and putting her
      hand on his shoulder. 'I can't bear that!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Delighting me deceptively! Why did you do it-why did you!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I began doing it in kindness to her! How could I do otherwise than try to
      save such a simple girl from misery? But I admit that I continued it for
      pleasure to myself.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Raye looked up. 'Why did it give you pleasure?' he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I must not tell,' said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      He continued to regard her, and saw that her lips suddenly began to quiver
      under his scrutiny, and her eyes to fill and droop. She started aside, and
      said that she must go to the station to catch the return train: could a
      cab be called immediately?
    </p>
    <p>
      But Raye went up to her, and took her unresisting hand. 'Well, to think of
      such a thing as this!' he said. 'Why, you and I are friends-lovers-devoted
      lovers-by correspondence!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes; I suppose.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'More.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'More?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Plainly more. It is no use bIRONlinking that. Legally I have married
      her-God help us both!-in soul and spirit I have married you, and no other
      woman in the world!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hush!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But I will not hush! Why should you try to disguise the full truth, when
      you have already owned half of it? Yes, it is between you and me that the
      bond is-not between me and her! Now I'll say no more. But, O my cruel one,
      I think I have one claim upon you!'
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not say what, and he drew her towards him, and bent over her. 'If
      it was all pure invention in those letters,' he said emphatically, 'give
      me your cheek only. If you meant what you said, let it be lips. It is for
      the first and last time, remember!'
    </p>
    <p>
      She put up her mouth, and he kissed her long. 'You forgive me?' she said
      crying.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But you are ruined!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What matter!' he said shrugging his shoulders. 'It serves me right!'
    </p>
    <p>
      She withdrew, wiped her eyes, entered and bade good-bye to Anna, who had
      not expected her to go so soon, and was still wrestling with the letter.
      Raye followed Edith downstairs, and in three minutes she was in a hansom
      driving to the Waterloo station.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went back to his wife. 'Never mind the letter, Anna, to-day,' he said
      gently. 'Put on your things. We, too, must be off shortly.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The simple girl, upheld by the sense that she was indeed married, showed
      her delight at finding that he was as kind as ever after the disclosure.
      She did not know that before his eyes he beheld as it were a galley, in
      which he, the fastidious urban, was chained to work for the remainder of
      his life, with her, the unlettered peasant, chained to his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edith travelled back to Melchester that day with a face that showed the
      very stupor of grief; her lips still tingling from the desperate pressure
      of his kiss. The end of her impassioned dream had come. When at dusk she
      reached the Melchester station her husband was there to meet her, but in
      his perfunctoriness and her preoccupation they did not see each other, and
      she went out of the station alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      She walked mechanically homewards without calling a fly. Entering, she
      could not bear the silence of the house, and went up in the dark to where
      Anna had slept, where she remained thinking awhile. She then returned to
      the drawing-room, and not knowing what she did, crouched down upon the
      floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have ruined him!' she kept repeating. 'I have ruined him; because I
      would not deal treacherously towards her!'
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of half an hour a figure opened the door of the apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah-who's that?' she said, starting up, for it was dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Your husband-who should it be?' said the worthy merchant.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah-my husband!-I forgot I had a husband!' she whispered to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I missed you at the station,' he continued. 'Did you see Anna safely tied
      up? I hope so, for 'twas time.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes-Anna is married.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Simultaneously with Edith's journey home Anna and her husband were sitting
      at the opposite windows of a second-class carriage which sped along to
      Knollsea. In his hand was a pocket-book full of creased sheets closely
      written over. Unfolding them one after another he read them in silence,
      and sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What are you doing, dear Charles?' she said timidly from the other
      window, and drew nearer to him as if he were a god.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Reading over all those sweet letters to me signed "Anna,"' he replied
      with dreary resignation.
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <p>
      The interior of St. James's Church, in Havenpool Town, was slowly
      darkening under the close clouds of a winter afternoon. It was Sunday:
      service had just ended, the face of the parson in the pulpit was buried in
      his hands, and the congregation, with a cheerful sigh of release, were
      rising from their knees to depart.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the moment the stillness was so complete that the surging of the sea
      could be heard outside the harbour-bar. Then it was broken by the
      footsteps of the clerk going towards the west door to open it in the usual
      manner for the exit of the assembly. Before, however, he had reached the
      doorway, the latch was lifted from without, and the dark figure of a man
      in a sailor's garb appeared against the light.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clerk stepped aside, the sailor closed the door gently behind him, and
      advanced up the nave till he stood at the chancel-step. The parson looked
      up from the private little prayer which, after so many for the parish, he
      quite fairly took for himself; rose to his feet, and stared at the
      intruder.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I beg your pardon, sir,' said the sailor, addressing the minister in a
      voice distinctly audible to all the congregation. 'I have come here to
      offer thanks for my narrow escape from shipwreck. I am given to understand
      that it is a proper thing to do, if you have no objection?'
    </p>
    <p>
      The parson, after a moment's pause, said hesitatingly, 'I have no
      objection; certainly. It is usual to mention any such wish before service,
      so that the proper words may be used in the General Thanksgiving. But, if
      you wish, we can read from the form for use after a storm at sea.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ay, sure; I ain't particular,' said the sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clerk thereupon directed the sailor to the page in the prayer-book
      where the collect of thanksgiving would be found, and the rector began
      reading it, the sailor kneeling where he stood, and repeating it after him
      word by word in a distinct voice. The people, who had remained agape and
      motionless at the proceeding, mechanically knelt down likewise; but they
      continued to regard the isolated form of the sailor who, in the precise
      middle of the chancel-step, remained fixed on his knees, facing the east,
      his hat beside him, his hands joined, and he quite unconscious of his
      appearance in their regard.
    </p>
    <p>
      When his thanksgiving had come to an end he rose; the people rose also,
      and all went out of church together. As soon as the sailor emerged, so
      that the remaining daylight fell upon his face, old inhabitants began to
      recognize him as no other than Shadrach Jolliffe, a young man who had not
      been seen at Havenpool for several years. A son of the town, his parents
      had died when he was quite young, on which account he had early gone to
      sea, in the Newfoundland trade.
    </p>
    <p>
      He talked with this and that townsman as he walked, informing them that,
      since leaving his native place years before, he had become captain and
      owner of a small coasting-ketch, which had providentially been saved from
      the gale as well as himself. Presently he drew near to two girls who were
      going out of the churchyard in front of him; they had been sitting in the
      nave at his entry, and had watched his doings with deep interest,
      afterwards discussing him as they moved out of church together. One was a
      slight and gentle creature, the other a tall, large-framed, deliberative
      girl. Captain Jolliffe regarded the loose curls of their hair, their backs
      and shoulders, down to their heels, for some time.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who may them two maids be?' he whispered to his neighbour.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The little one is Emily Hanning; the tall one Joanna Phippard.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah! I recollect 'em now, to be sure.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He advanced to their elbow, and genially stole a gaze at them.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Emily, you don't know me?' said the sailor, turning his beaming brown
      eyes on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I think I do, Mr. Jolliffe,' said Emily shyly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other girl looked straight at him with her dark eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The face of Miss Joanna I don't call to mind so well,' he continued. 'But
      I know her beginnings and kindred.'
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked and talked together, Jolliffe narrating particulars of his
      late narrow escape, till they reached the corner of Sloop Lane, in which
      Emily Hanning dwelt, when, with a nod and smile, she left them. Soon the
      sailor parted also from Joanna, and, having no especial errand or
      appointment, turned back towards Emily's house. She lived with her father,
      who called himself an accountant, the daughter, however, keeping a little
      stationery-shop as a supplemental provision for the gaps of his somewhat
      uncertain business. On entering Jolliffe found father and daughter about
      to begin tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, I didn't know it was tea-time,' he said. 'Ay, I'll have a cup with
      much pleasure.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He remained to tea and long afterwards, telling more tales of his
      seafaring life. Several neighbours called to listen, and were asked to
      come in. Somehow Emily Hanning lost her heart to the sailor that Sunday
      night, and in the course of a week or two there was a tender understanding
      between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      One moonlight evening in the next month Shadrach was ascending out of the
      town by the long straight road eastward, to an elevated suburb where the
      more fashionable houses stood-if anything near this ancient port could be
      called fashionable-when he saw a figure before him whom, from her manner
      of glancing back, he took to be Emily. But, on coming up, he found she was
      Joanna Phippard. He gave a gallant greeting, and walked beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Go along,' she said, 'or Emily will be jealous!'
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed not to like the suggestion, and remained. What was said and what
      was done on that walk never could be clearly recollected by Shadrach; but
      in some way or other Joanna contrived to wean him away from her gentler
      and younger rival. From that week onwards, Jolliffe was seen more and more
      in the wake of Joanna Phippard and less in the company of Emily; and it
      was soon rumoured about the quay that old Jolliffe's son, who had come
      home from sea, was going to be married to the former young woman, to the
      great disappointment of the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just after this report had gone about, Joanna dressed herself for a walk
      one morning, and started for Emily's house in the little cross-street.
      Intelligence of the deep sorrow of her friend on account of the loss of
      Shadrach had reached her ears also, and her conscience reproached her for
      winning him away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joanna was not altogether satisfied with the sailor. She liked his
      attentions, and she coveted the dignity of matrimony; but she had never
      been deeply in love with Jolliffe. For one thing, she was ambitious, and
      socially his position was hardly so good as her own, and there was always
      the chance of an attractive woman mating considerably above her. It had
      long been in her mind that she would not strongly object to give him back
      again to Emily if her friend felt so very badly about him. To this end she
      had written a letter of renunciation to Shadrach, which letter she carried
      in her hand, intending to send it if personal observation of Emily
      convinced her that her friend was suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joanna entered Sloop Lane and stepped down into the stationery-shop, which
      was below the pavement level. Emily's father was never at home at this
      hour of the day, and it seemed as though Emily were not at home either,
      for the visitor could make nobody hear. Customers came so seldom hither
      that a five minutes' absence of the proprietor counted for little. Joanna
      waited in the little shop, where Emily had tastefully set out-as women
      can-articles in themselves of slight value, so as to obscure the
      meagreness of the stock-in-trade; till she saw a figure pausing without
      the window apparently absorbed in the contemplation of the sixpenny books,
      packets of paper, and prints hung on a string. It was Captain Shadrach
      Jolliffe, peering in to ascertain if Emily were there alone. Moved by an
      impulse of reluctance to meet him in a spot which breathed of Emily,
      Joanna slipped through the door that communicated with the parlour at the
      back. She had frequently done so before, for in her friendship with Emily
      she had the freedom of the house without ceremony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolliffe entered the shop. Through the thin blind which screened the glass
      partition she could see that he was disappointed at not finding Emily
      there. He was about to go out again, when Emily's form darkened the
      doorway, hastening home from some errand. At sight of Jolliffe she started
      back as if she would have gone out again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't run away, Emily; don't!' said he. 'What can make ye afraid?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'm not afraid, Captain Jolliffe. Only-only I saw you all of a sudden,
      and-it made me jump!' Her voice showed that her heart had jumped even more
      than the rest of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I just called as I was passing,' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'For some paper?' She hastened behind the counter.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, no, Emily; why do ye get behind there? Why not stay by me? You seem
      to hate me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't hate you. How can I?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then come out, so that we can talk like Christians.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily obeyed with a fitful laugh, till she stood again beside him in the
      open part of the shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      'There's a dear,' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You mustn't say that, Captain Jolliffe; because the words belong to
      somebody else.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah! I know what you mean. But, Emily, upon my life I didn't know till
      this morning that you cared one bit about me, or I should not have done as
      I have done. I have the best of feelings for Joanna, but I know that from
      the beginning she hasn't cared for me more than in a friendly way; and I
      see now the one I ought to have asked to be my wife. You know, Emily, when
      a man comes home from sea after a long voyage he's as blind as a bat-he
      can't see who's who in women. They are all alike to him, beautiful
      creatures, and he takes the first that comes easy, without thinking if she
      loves him, or if he might not soon love another better than her. From the
      first I inclined to you most, but you were so backward and shy that I
      thought you didn't want me to bother 'ee, and so I went to Joanna.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't say any more, Mr. Jolliffe, don't!' said she, choking. 'You are
      going to marry Joanna next month, and it is wrong to-to-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, Emily, my darling!' he cried, and clasped her little figure in his
      arms before she was aware.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joanna, behind the curtain, turned pale, tried to withdraw her eyes, but
      could not.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is only you I love as a man ought to love the woman he is going to
      marry; and I know this from what Joanna has said, that she will willingly
      let me off! She wants to marry higher I know, and only said "Yes" to me
      out of kindness. A fine, tall girl like her isn't the sort for a plain
      sailor's wife: you be the best suited for that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He kissed her and kissed her again, her flexible form quivering in the
      agitation of his embrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I wonder-are you sure-Joanna is going to break off with you? O, are you
      sure? Because-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I know she would not wish to make us miserable. She will release me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, I hope-I hope she will! Don't stay any longer, Captain Jolliffe!'
    </p>
    <p>
      He lingered, however, till a customer came for a penny stick of sealing-
      wax, and then he withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Green envy had overspread Joanna at the scene. She looked about for a way
      of escape. To get out without Emily's knowledge of her visit was
      indispensable. She crept from the parlour into the passage, and thence to
      the front door of the house, where she let herself noiselessly into the
      street.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sight of that caress had reversed all her resolutions. She could not
      let Shadrach go. Reaching home she burnt the letter, and told her mother
      that if Captain Jolliffe called she was too unwell to see him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach, however, did not call. He sent her a note expressing in simple
      language the state of his feelings; and asked to be allowed to take
      advantage of the hints she had given him that her affection, too, was
      little more than friendly, by cancelling the engagement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking out upon the harbour and the island beyond he waited and waited in
      his lodgings for an answer that did not come. The suspense grew to be so
      intolerable that after dark he went up the High Street. He could not
      resist calling at Joanna's to learn his fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mother said her daughter was too unwell to see him, and to his
      questioning admitted that it was in consequence of a letter received from
      himself; which had distressed her deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You know what it was about, perhaps, Mrs. Phippard?' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Phippard owned that she did, adding that it put them in a very
      painful position. Thereupon Shadrach, fearing that he had been guilty of
      an enormity, explained that if his letter had pained Joanna it must be
      owing to a misunderstanding, since he had thought it would be a relief to
      her. If otherwise, he would hold himself bound by his word, and she was to
      think of the letter as never having been written.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning he received an oral message from the young woman, asking him
      to fetch her home from a meeting that evening. This he did, and while
      walking from the Town Hall to her door, with her hand in his arm, she
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is all the same as before between us, isn't it, Shadrach? Your letter
      was sent in mistake?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is all the same as before,' he answered, 'if you say it must be.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I wish it to be,' she murmured, with hard lineaments, as she thought of
      Emily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach was a religious and scrupulous man, who respected his word as his
      life. Shortly afterwards the wedding took place, Jolliffe having conveyed
      to Emily as gently as possible the error he had fallen into when
      estimating Joanna's mood as one of indifference.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <p>
      A month after the marriage Joanna's mother died, and the couple were
      obliged to turn their attention to very practical matters. Now that she
      was left without a parent, Joanna could not bear the notion of her husband
      going to sea again, but the question was, What could he do at home? They
      finally decided to take on a grocer's shop in High Street, the goodwill
      and stock of which were waiting to be disposed of at that time. Shadrach
      knew nothing of shopkeeping, and Joanna very little, but they hoped to
      learn.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the management of this grocery business they now devoted all their
      energies, and continued to conduct it for many succeeding years, without
      great success. Two sons were born to them, whom their mother loved to
      idolatry, although she had never passionately loved her husband; and she
      lavished upon them all her forethought and care. But the shop did not
      thrive, and the large dreams she had entertained of her sons' education
      and career became attenuated in the face of realities. Their schooling was
      of the plainest, but, being by the sea, they grew alert in all such
      nautical arts and enterprises as were attractive to their age.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great interest of the Jolliffes' married life, outside their own
      immediate household, had lain in the marriage of Emily. By one of those
      odd chances which lead those that lurk in unexpected corners to be
      discovered, while the obvious are passed by, the gentle girl had been seen
      and loved by a thriving merchant of the town, a widower, some years older
      than herself, though still in the prime of life. At first Emily had
      declared that she never, never could marry any one; but Mr. Lester had
      quietly persevered, and had at last won her reluctant assent. Two children
      also were the fruits of this union, and, as they grew and prospered, Emily
      declared that she had never supposed that she could live to be so happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The worthy merchant's home, one of those large, substantial brick mansions
      frequently jammed up in old-fashioned towns, faced directly on the High
      Street, nearly opposite to the grocery shop of the Jolliffes, and it now
      became the pain of Joanna to behold the woman whose place she had usurped
      out of pure covetousness, looking down from her position of comparative
      wealth upon the humble shop-window with its dusty sugar- loaves, heaps of
      raisins, and canisters of tea, over which it was her own lot to preside.
      The business having so dwindled, Joanna was obliged to serve in the shop
      herself; and it galled and mortified her that Emily Lester, sitting in her
      large drawing-room over the way, could witness her own dancings up and
      down behind the counter at the beck and call of wretched twopenny
      customers, whose patronage she was driven to welcome gladly: persons to
      whom she was compelled to be civil in the street, while Emily was bounding
      along with her children and her governess, and conversing with the
      genteelest people of the town and neighbourhood. This was what she had
      gained by not letting Shadrach Jolliffe, whom she had so faintly loved,
      carry his affection elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach was a good and honest man, and he had been faithful to her in
      heart and in deed. Time had clipped the wings of his love for Emily in his
      devotion to the mother of his boys: he had quite lived down that impulsive
      earlier fancy, and Emily had become in his regard nothing more than a
      friend. It was the same with Emily's feelings for him. Possibly, had she
      found the least cause for jealousy, Joanna would almost have been better
      satisfied. It was in the absolute acquiescence of Emily and Shadrach in
      the results she herself had contrived that her discontent found
      nourishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach was not endowed with the narrow shrewdness necessary for
      developing a retail business in the face of many competitors. Did a
      customer inquire if the grocer could really recommend the wondrous
      substitute for eggs which a persevering bagman had forced into his stock,
      he would answer that 'when you did not put eggs into a pudding it was
      difficult to taste them there'; and when he was asked if his 'real Mocha
      coffee' was real Mocha, he would say grimly, 'as understood in small
      shops.'
    </p>
    <p>
      One summer day, when the big brick house opposite was reflecting the
      oppressive sun's heat into the shop, and nobody was present but husband
      and wife, Joanna looked across at Emily's door, where a wealthy visitor's
      carriage had drawn up. Traces of patronage had been visible in Emily's
      manner of late.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Shadrach, the truth is, you are not a business-man,' his wife sadly
      murmured. 'You were not brought up to shopkeeping, and it is impossible
      for a man to make a fortune at an occupation he has jumped into, as you
      did into this.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolliffe agreed with her, in this as in everything else.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not that I care a rope's end about making a fortune,' he said cheerfully.
      'I am happy enough, and we can rub on somehow.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked again at the great house through the screen of bottled pickles.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Rub on-yes,' she said bitterly. 'But see how well off Emmy Lester is, who
      used to be so poor! Her boys will go to College, no doubt; and think of
      yours-obliged to go to the Parish School!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach's thoughts had flown to Emily.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nobody,' he said good-humouredly, 'ever did Emily a better turn than you
      did, Joanna, when you warned her off me and put an end to that little
      simpering nonsense between us, so as to leave it in her power to say "Aye"
      to Lester when he came along.' This almost maddened her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't speak of bygones!' she implored, in stern sadness. 'But think, for
      the boys' and my sake, if not for your own, what are we to do to get
      richer?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well,' he said, becoming serious, 'to tell the truth, I have always felt
      myself unfit for this business, though I've never liked to say so. I seem
      to want more room for sprawling; a more open space to strike out in than
      here among friends and neighbours. I could get rich as well as any man, if
      I tried my own way.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I wish you would! What is your way?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'To go to sea again.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She had been the very one to keep him at home, hating the semi-widowed
      existence of sailors' wives. But her ambition checked her instincts now,
      and she said: 'Do you think success really lies that way?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am sure it lies in no other.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you want to go, Shadrach?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not for the pleasure of it, I can tell 'ee. There's no such pleasure at
      sea, Joanna, as I can find in my back parlour here. To speak honest, I
      have no love for the brine. I never had much. But if it comes to a
      question of a fortune for you and the lads, it is another thing. That's
      the only way to it for one born and bred a seafarer as I.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Would it take long to earn?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, that depends; perhaps not.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning Shadrach pulled from a chest of drawers the nautical
      jacket he had worn during the first months of his return, brushed out the
      moths, donned it, and walked down to the quay. The port still did a fair
      business in the Newfoundland trade, though not so much as formerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not long after this that he invested all he possessed in purchasing
      a part-ownership in a brig, of which he was appointed captain. A few
      months were passed in coast-trading, during which interval Shadrach wore
      off the land-rust that had accumulated upon him in his grocery phase; and
      in the spring the brig sailed for Newfoundland.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joanna lived on at home with her sons, who were now growing up into strong
      lads, and occupying themselves in various ways about the harbour and quay.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never mind, let them work a little,' their fond mother said to herself.
      'Our necessities compel it now, but when Shadrach comes home they will be
      only seventeen and eighteen, and they shall be removed from the port, and
      their education thoroughly taken in hand by a tutor; and with the money
      they'll have they will perhaps be as near to gentlemen as Emmy Lester's
      precious two, with their algebra and their Latin!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The date for Shadrach's return drew near and arrived, and he did not
      appear. Joanna was assured that there was no cause for anxiety,
      sailing-ships being so uncertain in their coming; which assurance proved
      to be well grounded, for late one wet evening, about a month after the
      calculated time, the ship was announced as at hand, and presently the
      slip-slop step of Shadrach as the sailor sounded in the passage, and he
      entered. The boys had gone out and had missed him, and Joanna was sitting
      alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the first emotion of reunion between the couple had passed,
      Jolliffe explained the delay as owing to a small speculative contract,
      which had produced good results.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I was determined not to disappoint 'ee,' he said; 'and I think you'll own
      that I haven't!'
    </p>
    <p>
      With this he pulled out an enormous canvas bag, full and rotund as the
      money-bag of the giant whom Jack slew, untied it, and shook the contents
      out into her lap as she sat in her low chair by the fire. A mass of
      sovereigns and guineas (there were guineas on the earth in those days)
      fell into her lap with a sudden thud, weighing down her gown to the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      'There!' said Shadrach complacently. 'I told 'ee, dear, I'd do it; and
      have I done it or no?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Somehow her face, after the first excitement of possession, did not retain
      its glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is a lot of gold, indeed,' she said. 'And-is this all?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'All? Why, dear Joanna, do you know you can count to three hundred in that
      heap? It is a fortune!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes-yes. A fortune-judged by sea; but judged by land-'
    </p>
    <p>
      However, she banished considerations of the money for the nonce. Soon the
      boys came in, and next Sunday Shadrach returned thanks to God-this time by
      the more ordinary channel of the italics in the General Thanksgiving. But
      a few days after, when the question of investing the money arose, he
      remarked that she did not seem so satisfied as he had hoped.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well you see, Shadrach,' she answered, 'we count by hundreds; they count
      by thousands' (nodding towards the other side of the Street). 'They have
      set up a carriage and pair since you left.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, have they?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'My dear Shadrach, you don't know how the world moves. However, we'll do
      the best we can with it. But they are rich, and we are poor still!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The greater part of a year was desultorily spent. She moved sadly about
      the house and shop, and the boys were still occupying themselves in and
      around the harbour.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Joanna,' he said, one day, 'I see by your movements that it is not
      enough.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is not enough,' said she. 'My boys will have to live by steering the
      ships that the Lesters own; and I was once above her!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolliffe was not an argumentative man, and he only murmured that he
      thought he would make another voyage.
    </p>
    <p>
      He meditated for several days, and coming home from the quay one afternoon
      said suddenly:
    </p>
    <p>
      'I could do it for 'ee, dear, in one more trip, for certain, if-if-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do what, Shadrach?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Enable 'ee to count by thousands instead of hundreds.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If what?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If I might take the boys.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't say that, Shadrach,' she answered hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't like to hear it! There's danger at sea. I want them to be
      something genteel, and no danger to them. I couldn't let them risk their
      lives at sea. O, I couldn't ever, ever!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very well, dear, it shan't be done.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day, after a silence, she asked a question:
    </p>
    <p>
      'If they were to go with you it would make a great deal of difference, I
      suppose, to the profit?'
    </p>
    <p>
      ''Twould treble what I should get from the venture single-handed. Under my
      eye they would be as good as two more of myself.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Later on she said: 'Tell me more about this.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, the boys are almost as clever as master-mariners in handling a
      craft, upon my life! There isn't a more cranky place in the Northern Seas
      than about the sandbanks of this harbour, and they've practised here from
      their infancy. And they are so steady. I couldn't get their steadiness and
      their trustworthiness in half a dozen men twice their age.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And is it very dangerous at sea; now, too, there are rumours of war?' she
      asked uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, well, there be risks. Still . . . '
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea grew and magnified, and the mother's heart was crushed and
      stifled by it. Emmy was growing too patronizing; it could not be borne.
      Shadrach's wife could not help nagging him about their comparative
      poverty. The young men, amiable as their father, when spoken to on the
      subject of a voyage of enterprise, were quite willing to embark; and
      though they, like their father, had no great love for the sea, they became
      quite enthusiastic when the proposal was detailed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything now hung upon their mother's assent. She withheld it long, but
      at last gave the word: the young men might accompany their father.
      Shadrach was unusually cheerful about it: Heaven had preserved him
      hitherto, and he had uttered his thanks. God would not forsake those who
      were faithful to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that the Jolliffes possessed in the world was put into the enterprise.
      The grocery stock was pared down to the least that possibly could afford a
      bare sustenance to Joanna during the absence, which was to last through
      the usual 'New-f'nland spell.' How she would endure the weary time she
      hardly knew, for the boys had been with her formerly; but she nerved
      herself for the trial.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ship was laden with boots and shoes, ready-made clothing, fishing-
      tackle, butter, cheese, cordage, sailcloth, and many other commodities;
      and was to bring back oil, furs, skins, fish, cranberries, and what else
      came to hand. But much trading to other ports was to be undertaken between
      the voyages out and homeward, and thereby much money made.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <p>
      The brig sailed on a Monday morning in spring; but Joanna did not witness
      its departure. She could not bear the sight that she had been the means of
      bringing about. Knowing this, her husband told her overnight that they
      were to sail some time before noon next day hence when, awakening at five
      the next morning, she heard them bustling about downstairs, she did not
      hasten to descend, but lay trying to nerve herself for the parting,
      imagining they would leave about nine, as her husband had done on his
      previous voyage. When she did descend she beheld words chalked upon the
      sloping face of the bureau; but no husband or sons. In the
      hastily-scrawled lines Shadrach said they had gone off thus not to pain
      her by a leave-taking; and the sons had chalked under his words:
      'Good-bye, mother!'
    </p>
    <p>
      She rushed to the quay, and looked down the harbour towards the blue rim
      of the sea, but she could only see the masts and bulging sails of the
      Joanna; no human figures. ''Tis I have sent them!' she said wildly, and
      burst into tears. In the house the chalked 'Good-bye' nearly broke her
      heart. But when she had re-entered the front room, and looked across at
      Emily's, a gleam of triumph lit her thin face at her anticipated release
      from the thraldom of subservience.
    </p>
    <p>
      To do Emily Lester justice, her assumption of superiority was mainly a
      figment of Joanna's brain. That the circumstances of the merchant's wife
      were more luxurious than Joanna's, the former could not conceal; though
      whenever the two met, which was not very often now, Emily endeavoured to
      subdue the difference by every means in her power.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first summer lapsed away; and Joanna meagrely maintained herself by
      the shop, which now consisted of little more than a window and a counter.
      Emily was, in truth, her only large customer; and Mrs. Lester's kindly
      readiness to buy anything and everything without questioning the quality
      had a sting of bitterness in it, for it was the uncritical attitude of a
      patron, and almost of a donor. The long dreary winter moved on; the face
      of the bureau had been turned to the wall to protect the chalked words of
      farewell, for Joanna could never bring herself to rub them out; and she
      often glanced at them with wet eyes. Emily's handsome boys came home for
      the Christmas holidays; the University was talked of for them; and still
      Joanna subsisted as it were with held breath, like a person submerged.
      Only one summer more, and the 'spell' would end. Towards the close of the
      time Emily called on her quondam friend. She had heard that Joanna began
      to feel anxious; she had received no letter from husband or sons for some
      months. Emily's silks rustled arrogantly when, in response to Joanna's
      almost dumb invitation, she squeezed through the opening of the counter
      and into the parlour behind the shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are all success, and I am all the other way!' said Joanna.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But why do you think so?' said Emily. 'They are to bring back a fortune,
      I hear.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah! will they come? The doubt is more than a woman can bear. All three in
      one ship-think of that! And I have not heard of them for months!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But the time is not up. You should not meet misfortune half-way.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nothing will repay me for the grief of their absence!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then why did you let them go? You were doing fairly well.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I made them go!' she said, turning vehemently upon Emily. 'And I'll tell
      you why! I could not bear that we should be only muddling on, and you so
      rich and thriving! Now I have told you, and you may hate me if you will!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I shall never hate you, Joanna.'
    </p>
    <p>
      And she proved the truth of her words afterwards. The end of autumn came,
      and the brig should have been in port; but nothing like the Joanna
      appeared in the channel between the sands. It was now really time to be
      uneasy. Joanna Jolliffe sat by the fire, and every gust of wind caused her
      a cold thrill. She had always feared and detested the sea; to her it was a
      treacherous, restless, slimy creature, glorying in the griefs of women.
      'Still,' she said, 'they must come!'
    </p>
    <p>
      She recalled to her mind that Shadrach had said before starting that if
      they returned safe and sound, with success crowning their enterprise, he
      would go as he had gone after his shipwreck, and kneel with his sons in
      the church, and offer sincere thanks for their deliverance. She went to
      church regularly morning and afternoon, and sat in the most forward pew,
      nearest the chancel-step. Her eyes were mostly fixed on that step, where
      Shadrach had knelt in the bloom of his young manhood: she knew to an inch
      the spot which his knees had pressed twenty winters before; his outline as
      he had knelt, his hat on the step beside him. God was good. Surely her
      husband must kneel there again: a son on each side as he had said; George
      just here, Jim just there. By long watching the spot as she worshipped it
      became as if she saw the three returned ones there kneeling; the two slim
      outlines of her boys, the more bulky form between them; their hands
      clasped, their heads shaped against the eastern wall. The fancy grew
      almost to an hallucination: she could never turn her worn eyes to the step
      without seeing them there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless they did not come. Heaven was merciful, but it was not yet
      pleased to relieve her soul. This was her purgation for the sin of making
      them the slaves of her ambition. But it became more than purgation soon,
      and her mood approached despair. Months had passed since the brig had been
      due, but it had not returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joanna was always hearing or seeing evidences of their arrival. When on
      the hill behind the port, whence a view of the open Channel could be
      obtained, she felt sure that a little speck on the horizon, breaking the
      eternally level waste of waters southward, was the truck of the Joana's
      mainmast. Or when indoors, a shout or excitement of any kind at the corner
      of the Town Cellar, where the High Street joined the Quay, caused her to
      spring to her feet and cry: ''Tis they!'
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was not. The visionary forms knelt every Sunday afternoon on the
      chancel-step, but not the real. Her shop had, as it were, eaten itself
      hollow. In the apathy which had resulted from her loneliness and grief she
      had ceased to take in the smallest supplies, and thus had sent away her
      last customer.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this strait Emily Lester tried by every means in her power to aid the
      afflicted woman; but she met with constant repulses.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't like you! I can't bear to see you!' Joanna would whisper hoarsely
      when Emily came to her and made advances.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But I want to help and soothe you, Joanna,' Emily would say.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are a lady, with a rich husband and fine sons! What can you want with
      a bereaved crone like me!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Joanna, I want this: I want you to come and live in my house, and not
      stay alone in this dismal place any longer.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And suppose they come and don't find me at home? You wish to separate me
      and mine! No, I'll stay here. I don't like you, and I can't thank you,
      whatever kindness you do me!'
    </p>
    <p>
      However, as time went on Joanna could not afford to pay the rent of the
      shop and house without an income. She was assured that all hope of the
      return of Shadrach and his sons was vain, and she reluctantly consented to
      accept the asylum of the Lesters' house. Here she was allotted a room of
      her own on the second floor, and went and came as she chose, without
      contact with the family. Her hair greyed and whitened, deep lines
      channeled her forehead, and her form grew gaunt and stooping. But she
      still expected the lost ones, and when she met Emily on the staircase she
      would say morosely: 'I know why you've got me here! They'll come, and be
      disappointed at not finding me at home, and perhaps go away again; and
      then you'll be revenged for my taking Shadrach away from 'ee!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily Lester bore these reproaches from the grief-stricken soul. She was
      sure-all the people of Havenpool were sure-that Shadrach and his sons
      could not return. For years the vessel had been given up as lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, when awakened at night by any noise, Joanna would rise from
      bed and glance at the shop opposite by the light from the flickering lamp,
      to make sure it was not they.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a damp and dark December night, six years after the departure of
      the brig Joanna. The wind was from the sea, and brought up a fishy mist
      which mopped the face like moist flannel. Joanna had prayed her usual
      prayer for the absent ones with more fervour and confidence than she had
      felt for months, and had fallen asleep about eleven. It must have been
      between one and two when she suddenly started up. She had certainly heard
      steps in the street, and the voices of Shadrach and her sons calling at
      the door of the grocery shop. She sprang out of bed, and, hardly knowing
      what clothing she dragged on herself; hastened down Emily's large and
      carpeted staircase, put the candle on the hall-table, unfastened the bolts
      and chain, and stepped into the street. The mist, blowing up the street
      from the Quay, hindered her seeing the shop, although it was so near; but
      she had crossed to it in a moment. How was it? Nobody stood there. The
      wretched woman walked wildly up and down with her bare feet-there was not
      a soul. She returned and knocked with all her might at the door which had
      once been her own-they might have been admitted for the night, unwilling
      to disturb her till the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not till several minutes had elapsed that the young man who now
      kept the shop looked out of an upper window, and saw the skeleton of
      something human standing below half-dressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Has anybody come?' asked the form.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, Mrs. Jolliffe, I didn't know it was you,' said the young man kindly,
      for he was aware how her baseless expectations moved her. 'No; nobody has
      come.'

      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <p>
      Here stretch the downs, high and breezy and green, absolutely unchanged
      since those eventful days. A plough has never disturbed the turf, and the
      sod that was uppermost then is uppermost now. Here stood the camp; here
      are distinct traces of the banks thrown up for the horses of the cavalry,
      and spots where the midden-heaps lay are still to be observed. At night,
      when I walk across the lonely place, it is impossible to avoid hearing,
      amid the scourings of the wind over the grass-bents and thistles, the old
      trumpet and bugle calls, the rattle of the halters; to help seeing rows of
      spectral tents and the impedimenta of the soldiery. From within the
      canvases come guttural syllables of foreign tongues, and broken songs of
      the fatherland; for they were mainly regiments of the King's German Legion
      that slept round the tent-poles hereabout at that time.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nearly ninety years ago. The British uniform of the period, with
      its immense epaulettes, queer cocked-hat, breeches, gaiters, ponderous
      cartridge-box, buckled shoes, and what not, would look strange and
      barbarous now. Ideas have changed; invention has followed invention.
      Soldiers were monumental objects then. A divinity still hedged kings here
      and there; and war was considered a glorious thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secluded old manor-houses and hamlets lie in the ravines and hollows among
      these hills, where a stranger had hardly ever been seen till the King
      chose to take the baths yearly at the sea-side watering-place a few miles
      to the south; as a consequence of which battalions descended in a cloud
      upon the open country around. Is it necessary to add that the echoes of
      many characteristic tales, dating from that picturesque time, still linger
      about here in more or less fragmentary form, to be caught by the attentive
      ear? Some of them I have repeated; most of them I have forgotten; one I
      have never repeated, and assuredly can never forget.
    </p>
    <p>
      Phyllis told me the story with her own lips. She was then an old lady of
      seventy-five, and her auditor a lad of fifteen. She enjoined silence as to
      her share in the incident, till she should be 'dead, buried, and
      forgotten.' Her life was prolonged twelve years after the day of her
      narration, and she has now been dead nearly twenty. The oblivion which in
      her modesty and humility she courted for herself has only partially fallen
      on her, with the unfortunate result of inflicting an injustice upon her
      memory; since such fragments of her story as got abroad at the time, and
      have been kept alive ever since, are precisely those which are most
      unfavourable to her character.
    </p>
    <p>
      It all began with the arrival of the York Hussars, one of the foreign
      regiments above alluded to. Before that day scarcely a soul had been seen
      near her father's house for weeks. When a noise like the brushing skirt of
      a visitor was heard on the doorstep, it proved to be a scudding leaf; when
      a carriage seemed to be nearing the door, it was her father grinding his
      sickle on the stone in the garden for his favourite relaxation of trimming
      the box-tree borders to the plots. A sound like luggage thrown down from
      the coach was a gun far away at sea; and what looked like a tall man by
      the gate at dusk was a yew bush cut into a quaint and attenuated shape.
      There is no such solitude in country places now as there was in those old
      days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet all the while King George and his court were at his favourite sea-
      side resort, not more than five miles off.
    </p>
    <p>
      The daughter's seclusion was great, but beyond the seclusion of the girl
      lay the seclusion of the father. If her social condition was twilight, his
      was darkness. Yet he enjoyed his darkness, while her twilight oppressed
      her. Dr. Grove had been a professional man whose taste for lonely
      meditation over metaphysical questions had diminished his practice till it
      no longer paid him to keep it going; after which he had relinquished it
      and hired at a nominal rent the small, dilapidated, half farm half
      manor-house of this obscure inland nook, to make a sufficiency of an
      income which in a town would have been inadequate for their maintenance.
      He stayed in his garden the greater part of the day, growing more and more
      irritable with the lapse of time, and the increasing perception that he
      had wasted his life in the pursuit of illusions. He saw his friends less
      and less frequently. Phyllis became so shy that if she met a stranger
      anywhere in her short rambles she felt ashamed at his gaze, walked
      awkwardly, and blushed to her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet Phyllis was discovered even here by an admirer, and her hand most
      unexpectedly asked in marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King, as aforesaid, was at the neighbouring town, where he had taken
      up his abode at Gloucester Lodge and his presence in the town naturally
      brought many county people thither. Among these idlers-many of whom
      professed to have connections and interests with the Court-was one
      Humphrey Gould, a bachelor; a personage neither young nor old; neither
      good-looking nor positively plain. Too steady-going to be 'a buck' (as
      fast and unmarried men were then called), he was an approximately
      fashionable man of a mild type. This bachelor of thirty found his way to
      the village on the down: beheld Phyllis; made her father's acquaintance in
      order to make hers; and by some means or other she sufficiently inflamed
      his heart to lead him in that direction almost daily; till he became
      engaged to marry her.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he was of an old local family, some of whose members were held in
      respect in the county, Phyllis, in bringing him to her feet, had
      accomplished what was considered a brilliant move for one in her
      constrained position. How she had done it was not quite known to Phyllis
      herself. In those days unequal marriages were regarded rather as a
      violation of the laws of nature than as a mere infringement of convention,
      the more modern view, and hence when Phyllis, of the watering-place
      bourgeoisie, was chosen by such a gentlemanly fellow, it was as if she
      were going to be taken to heaven, though perhaps the uninformed would have
      seen no great difference in the respective positions of the pair, the said
      Gould being as poor as a crow.
    </p>
    <p>
      This pecuniary condition was his excuse-probably a true one-for postponing
      their union, and as the winter drew nearer, and the King departed for the
      season, Mr. Humphrey Gould set out for Bath, promising to return to
      Phyllis in a few weeks. The winter arrived, the date of his promise
      passed, yet Gould postponed his coming, on the ground that he could not
      very easily leave his father in the city of their sojourn, the elder
      having no other relative near him. Phyllis, though lonely in the extreme,
      was content. The man who had asked her in marriage was a desirable husband
      for her in many ways; her father highly approved of his suit; but this
      neglect of her was awkward, if not painful, for Phyllis. Love him in the
      true sense of the word she assured me she never did, but she had a genuine
      regard for him; admired a certain methodical and dogged way in which he
      sometimes took his pleasure; valued his knowledge of what the Court was
      doing, had done, or was about to do; and she was not without a feeling of
      pride that he had chosen her when he might have exercised a more ambitious
      choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he did not come; and the spring developed. His letters were regular
      though formal; and it is not to be wondered that the uncertainty of her
      position, IRONlinked with the fact that there was not much passion in her
      thoughts of Humphrey, bred an indescribable dreariness in the heart of
      Phyllis Grove. The spring was soon summer, and the summer brought the
      King; but still no Humphrey Gould. All this while the engagement by letter
      was maintained intact.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point of time a golden radiance flashed in upon the lives of
      people here, and charged all youthful thought with emotional interest.
      This radiance was the aforesaid York Hussars.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <p>
      The present generation has probably but a very dim notion of the
      celebrated York Hussars of ninety years ago. They were one of the
      regiments of the King's German Legion, and (though they somewhat
      degenerated later on) their brilliant uniform, their splendid horses, and
      above all, their foreign air and mustachios (rare appendages then), drew
      crowds of admirers of both sexes wherever they went. These with other
      regiments had come to encamp on the downs and pastures, because of the
      presence of the King in the neighbouring town.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spot was high and airy, and the view extensive, commanding the Isle of
      Portland in front, and reaching to St. Aldhelm's Head eastward, and almost
      to the Start on the west.
    </p>
    <p>
      Phyllis, though not precisely a girl of the village, was as interested as
      any of them in this military investment. Her father's home stood somewhat
      apart, and on the highest point of ground to which the lane ascended, so
      that it was almost level with the top of the church tower in the lower
      part of the parish. Immediately from the outside of the garden-wall the
      grass spread away to a great distance, and it was crossed by a path which
      came close to the wall. Ever since her childhood it had been Phyllis's
      pleasure to clamber up this fence and sit on the top-a feat not so
      difficult as it may seem, the walls in this district being built of
      rubble, without mortar, so that there were plenty of crevices for small
      toes.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was sitting up here one day, listlessly surveying the pasture without,
      when her attention was arrested by a solitary figure walking along the
      path. It was one of the renowned German Hussars, and he moved onward with
      his eyes on the ground, and with the manner of one who wished to escape
      company. His head would probably have been bent like his eyes but for his
      stiff neck-gear. On nearer view she perceived that his face was marked
      with deep sadness. Without observing her, he advanced by the footpath till
      it brought him almost immediately under the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Phyllis was much surprised to see a fine, tall soldier in such a mood as
      this. Her theory of the military, and of the York Hussars in particular
      (derived entirely from hearsay, for she had never talked to a soldier in
      her life), was that their hearts were as gay as their accoutrements.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the Hussar lifted his eyes and noticed her on her perch,
      the white muslin neckerchief which covered her shoulders and neck where
      left bare by her low gown, and her white raiment in general, showing
      conspicuously in the bright sunlight of this summer day. He blushed a
      little at the suddenness of the encounter, and without halting a moment
      from his pace passed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that day the foreigner's face haunted Phyllis; its aspect was so
      striking, so handsome, and his eyes were so blue, and sad, and abstracted.
      It was perhaps only natural that on some following day at the same hour
      she should look over that wall again, and wait till he had passed a second
      time. On this occasion he was reading a letter, and at the sight of her
      his manner was that of one who had half expected or hoped to discover her.
      He almost stopped, smiled, and made a courteous salute. The end of the
      meeting was that they exchanged a few words. She asked him what he was
      reading, and he readily informed her that he was re-perusing letters from
      his mother in Germany; he did not get them often, he said, and was forced
      to read the old ones a great many times. This was all that passed at the
      present interview, but others of the same kind followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Phyllis used to say that his English, though not good, was quite
      intelligible to her, so that their acquaintance was never hindered by
      difficulties of speech. Whenever the subject became too delicate, subtle,
      or tender, for such words of English as were at his command, the eyes no
      doubt helped out the tongue, and-though this was later on-the lips helped
      out the eyes. In short this acquaintance, unguardedly made, and rash
      enough on her part, developed and ripened. Like Desdemona, she pitied him,
      and learnt his history.
    </p>
    <p>
      His name was Matthaus Tina, and Saarbruck his native town, where his
      mother was still living. His age was twenty-two, and he had already risen
      to the grade of corporal, though he had not long been in the army. Phyllis
      used to assert that no such refined or well-educated young man could have
      been found in the ranks of the purely English regiments, some of these
      foreign soldiers having rather the graceful manner and presence of our
      native officers than of our rank and file.
    </p>
    <p>
      She by degrees learnt from her foreign friend a circumstance about himself
      and his comrades which Phyllis would least have expected of the York
      Hussars. So far from being as gay as its uniform, the regiment was
      pervaded by a dreadful melancholy, a chronic home-sickness, which
      depressed many of the men to such an extent that they could hardly attend
      to their drill. The worst sufferers were the younger soldiers who had not
      been over here long. They hated England and English life; they took no
      interest whatever in King George and his island kingdom, and they only
      wished to be out of it and never to see it any more. Their bodies were
      here, but their hearts and minds were always far away in their dear
      fatherland, of which-brave men and stoical as they were in many ways-they
      would speak with tears in their eyes. One of the worst of the sufferers
      from this home-woe, as he called it in his own tongue, was Matthaus Tina,
      whose dreamy musing nature felt the gloom of exile still more intensely
      from the fact that he had left a lonely mother at home with nobody to
      cheer her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though Phyllis, touched by all this, and interested in his history, did
      not disdain her soldier's acquaintance, she declined (according to her own
      account, at least) to permit the young man to overstep the line of mere
      friendship for a long while-as long, indeed, as she considered herself
      likely to become the possession of another; though it is probable that she
      had lost her heart to Matthaus before she was herself aware. The stone
      wall of necessity made anything like intimacy difficult; and he had never
      ventured to come, or to ask to come, inside the garden, so that all their
      conversation had been overtly conducted across this boundary.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <p>
      But news reached the village from a friend of Phyllis's father concerning
      Mr. Humphrey Gould, her remarkably cool and patient betrothed. This
      gentleman had been heard to say in Bath that he considered his overtures
      to Miss Phyllis Grove to have reached only the stage of a
      half-understanding; and in view of his enforced absence on his father's
      account, who was too great an invalid now to attend to his affairs, he
      thought it best that there should be no definite promise as yet on either
      side. He was not sure, indeed, that he might not cast his eyes elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      This account-though only a piece of hearsay, and as such entitled to no
      absolute credit-tallied so well with the infrequency of his letters and
      their lack of warmth, that Phyllis did not doubt its truth for one moment;
      and from that hour she felt herself free to bestow her heart as she should
      choose. Not so her father; he declared the whole story to be a
      fabrication. He had known Mr. Gould's family from his boyhood; and if
      there was one proverb which expressed the matrimonial aspect of that
      family well, it was 'Love me little, love me long.' Humphrey was an
      honourable man, who would not think of treating his engagement so lightly.
      'Do you wait in patience,' he said; 'all will be right enough in time.'
    </p>
    <p>
      From these words Phyllis at first imagined that her father was in
      correspondence with Mr. Gould; and her heart sank within her; for in spite
      of her original intentions she had been relieved to hear that her
      engagement had come to nothing. But she presently learnt that her father
      had heard no more of Humphrey Gould than she herself had done; while he
      would not write and address her affianced directly on the subject, lest it
      should be deemed an imputation on that bachelor's honour.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You want an excuse for encouraging one or other of those foreign fellows
      to flatter you with his unmeaning attentions,' her father exclaimed, his
      mood having of late been a very unkind one towards her. 'I see more than I
      say. Don't you ever set foot outside that garden- fence without my
      permission. If you want to see the camp I'll take you myself some Sunday
      afternoon.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Phyllis had not the smallest intention of disobeying him in her actions,
      but she assumed herself to be independent with respect to her feelings.
      She no longer checked her fancy for the Hussar, though she was far from
      regarding him as her lover in the serious sense in which an Englishman
      might have been regarded as such. The young foreign soldier was almost an
      ideal being to her, with none of the appurtenances of an ordinary
      house-dweller; one who had descended she knew not whence, and would
      disappear she knew not whither; the subject of a fascinating dream-no
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      They met continually now-mostly at dusk-during the brief interval between
      the going down of the sun and the minute at which the last trumpet-call
      summoned him to his tent. Perhaps her manner had become less restrained
      latterly; at any rate that of the Hussar was so; he had grown more tender
      every day, and at parting after these hurried interviews she reached down
      her hand from the top of the wall that he might press it. One evening he
      held it so long that she exclaimed, 'The wall is white, and somebody in
      the field may see your shape against it!'
    </p>
    <p>
      He lingered so long that night that it was with the greatest difficulty
      that he could run across the intervening stretch of ground and enter the
      camp in time. On the next occasion of his awaiting her she did not appear
      in her usual place at the usual hour. His disappointment was unspeakably
      keen; he remained staring blankly at the spot, like a man in a trance. The
      trumpets and tattoo sounded, and still he did not go.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had been delayed purely by an accident. When she arrived she was
      anxious because of the lateness of the hour, having heard as well as he
      the sounds denoting the closing of the camp. She implored him to leave
      immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No,' he said gloomily. 'I shall not go in yet-the moment you come-I have
      thought of your coming all day.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But you may be disgraced at being after time?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't mind that. I should have disappeared from the world some time ago
      if it had not been for two persons-my beloved, here, and my mother in
      Saarbruck. I hate the army. I care more for a minute of your company than
      for all the promotion in the world.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus he stayed and talked to her, and told her interesting details of his
      native place, and incidents of his childhood, till she was in a simmer of
      distress at his recklessness in remaining. It was only because she
      insisted on bidding him good-night and leaving the wall that he returned
      to his quarters.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next time that she saw him he was without the stripes that had adorned
      his sleeve. He had been broken to the level of private for his lateness
      that night; and as Phyllis considered herself to be the cause of his
      disgrace her sorrow was great. But the position was now reversed; it was
      his turn to cheer her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't grieve, meine Liebliche!' he said. 'I have got a remedy for
      whatever comes. First, even supposing I regain my stripes, would your
      father allow you to marry a non-commissioned officer in the York Hussars?'
    </p>
    <p>
      She flushed. This practical step had not been in her mind in relation to
      such an unrealistic person as he was; and a moment's reflection was enough
      for it. 'My father would not-certainly would not,' she answered
      unflinchingly. 'It cannot be thought of! My dear friend, please do forget
      me: I fear I am ruining you and your prospects!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not at all!' said he. 'You are giving this country of yours just
      sufficient interest to me to make me care to keep alive in it. If my dear
      land were here also, and my old parent, with you, I could be happy as I
      am, and would do my best as a soldier. But it is not so. And now listen.
      This is my plan. That you go with me to my own country, and be my wife
      there, and live there with my mother and me. I am not a Hanoverian, as you
      know, though I entered the army as such; my country is by the Saar, and is
      at peace with France, and if I were once in it I should be free.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But how get there?' she asked. Phyllis had been rather amazed than
      shocked at his proposition. Her position in her father's house was growing
      irksome and painful in the extreme; his parental affection seemed to be
      quite dried up. She was not a native of the village, like all the joyous
      girls around her; and in some way Matthaus Tina had infected her with his
      own passionate longing for his country, and mother, and home.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But how?' she repeated, finding that he did not answer. 'Will you buy
      your discharge?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, no,' he said. 'That's impossible in these times. No; I came here
      against my will; why should I not escape? Now is the time, as we shall
      soon be striking camp, and I might see you no more. This is my scheme. I
      will ask you to meet me on the highway two miles off; on some calm night
      next week that may be appointed. There will be nothing unbecoming in it,
      or to cause you shame; you will not fly alone with me, for I will bring
      with me my devoted young friend Christoph, an Alsatian, who has lately
      joined the regiment, and who has agreed to assist in this enterprise. We
      shall have come from yonder harbour, where we shall have examined the
      boats, and found one suited to our purpose. Christoph has already a chart
      of the Channel, and we will then go to the harbour, and at midnight cut
      the boat from her moorings, and row away round the point out of sight; and
      by the next morning we are on the coast of France, near Cherbourg. The
      rest is easy, for I have saved money for the land journey, and can get a
      change of clothes. I will write to my mother, who will meet us on the
      way.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He added details in reply to her inquiries, which left no doubt in
      Phyllis's mind of the feasibility of the undertaking. But its magnitude
      almost appalled her; and it is questionable if she would ever have gone
      further in the wild adventure if, on entering the house that night, her
      father had not accosted her in the most significant terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How about the York Hussars?' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'They are still at the camp; but they are soon going away, I believe.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is useless for you to attempt to cloak your actions in that way. You
      have been meeting one of those fellows; you have been seen walking with
      him-foreign barbarians, not much better than the French themselves! I have
      made up my mind-don't speak a word till I have done, please!-I have made
      up my mind that you shall stay here no longer while they are on the spot.
      You shall go to your aunt's.'
    </p>
    <p>
      It was useless for her to protest that she had never taken a walk with any
      soldier or man under the sun except himself. Her protestations were
      feeble, too, for though he was not literally correct in his assertion, he
      was virtually only half in error.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house of her father's sister was a prison to Phyllis. She had quite
      recently undergone experience of its gloom; and when her father went on to
      direct her to pack what would be necessary for her to take, her heart died
      within her. In after years she never attempted to excuse her conduct
      during this week of agitation; but the result of her self- communing was
      that she decided to join in the scheme of her lover and his friend, and
      fly to the country which he had coloured with such lovely hues in her
      imagination. She always said that the one feature in his proposal which
      overcame her hesitation was the obvious purity and straightforwardness of
      his intentions. He showed himself to be so virtuous and kind; he treated
      her with a respect to which she had never before been accustomed; and she
      was braced to the obvious risks of the voyage by her confidence in him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was on a soft, dark evening of the following week that they engaged in
      the adventure. Tina was to meet her at a point in the highway at which the
      lane to the village branched off. Christoph was to go ahead of them to the
      harbour where the boat lay, row it round the Nothe-or Look-out as it was
      called in those days-and pick them up on the other side of the promontory,
      which they were to reach by crossing the harbour-bridge on foot, and
      climbing over the Look-out hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as her father had ascended to his room she left the house, and,
      bundle in hand, proceeded at a trot along the lane. At such an hour not a
      soul was afoot anywhere in the village, and she reached the junction of
      the lane with the highway unobserved. Here she took up her position in the
      obscurity formed by the angle of a fence, whence she could discern every
      one who approached along the turnpike-road, without being herself seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had not remained thus waiting for her lover longer than a
      minute-though from the tension of her nerves the lapse of even that short
      time was trying-when, instead of the expected footsteps, the stage-coach
      could be heard descending the hill. She knew that Tina would not show
      himself till the road was clear, and waited impatiently for the coach to
      pass. Nearing the corner where she was it slackened speed, and, instead of
      going by as usual, drew up within a few yards of her. A passenger
      alighted, and she heard his voice. It was Humphrey Gould's.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had brought a friend with him, and luggage. The luggage was deposited
      on the grass, and the coach went on its route to the royal watering-place.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I wonder where that young man is with the horse and trap?' said her
      former admirer to his companion. 'I hope we shan't have to wait here long.
      I told him half-past nine o'clock precisely.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Have you got her present safe?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Phyllis's? O, yes. It is in this trunk. I hope it will please her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of course it will. What woman would not be pleased with such a handsome
      peace-offering?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well-she deserves it. I've treated her rather badly. But she has been in
      my mind these last two days much more than I should care to confess to
      everybody. Ah, well; I'll say no more about that. It cannot be that she is
      so bad as they make out. I am quite sure that a girl of her good wit would
      know better than to get entangled with any of those Hanoverian soldiers. I
      won't believe it of her, and there's an end on't.'
    </p>
    <p>
      More words in the same strain were casually dropped as the two men waited;
      words which revealed to her, as by a sudden illumination, the enormity of
      her conduct. The conversation was at length cut off by the arrival of the
      man with the vehicle. The luggage was placed in it, and they mounted, and
      were driven on in the direction from which she had just come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Phyllis was so conscience-stricken that she was at first inclined to
      follow them; but a moment's reflection led her to feel that it would only
      be bare justice to Matthaus to wait till he arrived, and explain candidly
      that she had changed her mind-difficult as the struggle would be when she
      stood face to face with him. She bitterly reproached herself for having
      believed reports which represented Humphrey Gould as false to his
      engagement, when, from what she now heard from his own lips, she gathered
      that he had been living full of trust in her. But she knew well enough who
      had won her love. Without him her life seemed a dreary prospect, yet the
      more she looked at his proposal the more she feared to accept it-so wild
      as it was, so vague, so venturesome. She had promised Humphrey Gould, and
      it was only his assumed faithlessness which had led her to treat that
      promise as nought. His solicitude in bringing her these gifts touched her;
      her promise must be kept, and esteem must take the place of love. She
      would preserve her self- respect. She would stay at home, and marry him,
      and suffer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Phyllis had thus braced herself to an exceptional fortitude when, a few
      minutes later, the outline of Matthaus Tina appeared behind a field- gate,
      over which he lightly leapt as she stepped forward. There was no evading
      it, he pressed her to his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is the first and last time!' she wildly thought as she stood encircled
      by his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      How Phyllis got through the terrible ordeal of that night she could never
      clearly recollect. She always attributed her success in carrying out her
      resolve to her lover's honour, for as soon as she declared to him in
      feeble words that she had changed her mind, and felt that she could not,
      dared not, fly with him, he forbore to urge her, grieved as he was at her
      decision. Unscrupulous pressure on his part, seeing how romantically she
      had become attached to him, would no doubt have turned the balance in his
      favour. But he did nothing to tempt her unduly or unfairly.
    </p>
    <p>
      On her side, fearing for his safety, she begged him to remain. This, he
      declared, could not be. 'I cannot break faith with my friend,' said he.
      Had he stood alone he would have abandoned his plan. But Christoph, with
      the boat and compass and chart, was waiting on the shore; the tide would
      soon turn; his mother had been warned of his coming; go he must.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many precious minutes were lost while he tarried, unable to tear himself
      away. Phyllis held to her resolve, though it cost her many a bitter pang.
      At last they parted, and he went down the hill. Before his footsteps had
      quite died away she felt a desire to behold at least his outline once
      more, and running noiselessly after him regained view of his diminishing
      figure. For one moment she was sufficiently excited to be on the point of
      rushing forward and IRONlinking her fate with his. But she could not. The
      courage which at the critical instant failed Cleopatra of Egypt could
      scarcely be expected of Phyllis Grove.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dark shape, similar to his own, joined him in the highway. It was
      Christoph, his friend. She could see no more; they had hastened on in the
      direction of the town and harbour, four miles ahead. With a feeling akin
      to despair she turned and slowly pursued her way homeward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tattoo sounded in the camp; but there was no camp for her now. It was as
      dead as the camp of the Assyrians after the passage of the Destroying
      Angel.
    </p>
    <p>
      She noiselessly entered the house, seeing nobody, and went to bed. Grief,
      which kept her awake at first, ultimately wrapped her in a heavy sleep.
      The next morning her father met her at the foot of the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr. Gould is come!' he said triumphantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey was staying at the inn, and had already called to inquire for
      her. He had brought her a present of a very handsome looking-glass in a
      frame of repousse silverwork, which her father held in his hand. He had
      promised to call again in the course of an hour, to ask Phyllis to walk
      with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pretty mirrors were rarer in country-houses at that day than they are now,
      and the one before her won Phyllis's admiration. She looked into it, saw
      how heavy her eyes were, and endeavoured to brighten them. She was in that
      wretched state of mind which leads a woman to move mechanically onward in
      what she conceives to be her allotted path. Mr. Humphrey had, in his
      undemonstrative way, been adhering all along to the old understanding; it
      was for her to do the same, and to say not a word of her own lapse. She
      put on her bonnet and tippet, and when he arrived at the hour named she
      was at the door awaiting him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <p>
      Phyllis thanked him for his beautiful gift; but the talking was soon
      entirely on Humphrey's side as they walked along. He told her of the
      latest movements of the world of fashion-a subject which she willingly
      discussed to the exclusion of anything more personal-and his measured
      language helped to still her disquieted heart and brain. Had not her own
      sadness been what it was she must have observed his embarrassment. At last
      he abruptly changed the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am glad you are pleased with my little present,' he said. 'The truth is
      that I brought it to propitiate 'ee, and to get you to help me out of a
      mighty difficulty.'
    </p>
    <p>
      It was inconceivable to Phyllis that this independent bachelor-whom she
      admired in some respects-could have a difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Phyllis-I'll tell you my secret at once; for I have a monstrous secret to
      confide before I can ask your counsel. The case is, then, that I am
      married: yes, I have privately married a dear young belle; and if you knew
      her, and I hope you will, you would say everything in her praise. But she
      is not quite the one that my father would have chose for me-you know the
      paternal idea as well as I-and I have kept it secret. There will be a
      terrible noise, no doubt; but I think that with your help I may get over
      it. If you would only do me this good turn-when I have told my father, I
      mean-say that you never could have married me, you know, or something of
      that sort-'pon my life it will help to smooth the way vastly. I am so
      anxious to win him round to my point of view, and not to cause any
      estrangement.'
    </p>
    <p>
      What Phyllis replied she scarcely knew, or how she counselled him as to
      his unexpected situation. Yet the relief that his announcement brought her
      was perceptible. To have confided her trouble in return was what her
      aching heart longed to do; and had Humphrey been a woman she would
      instantly have poured out her tale. But to him she feared to confess; and
      there was a real reason for silence, till a sufficient time had elapsed to
      allow her lover and his comrade to get out of harm's way.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as she reached home again she sought a solitary place, and spent
      the time in half regretting that she had not gone away, and in dreaming
      over the meetings with Matthaus Tina from their beginning to their end. In
      his own country, amongst his own countrywomen, he would possibly soon
      forget her, even to her very name.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her listlessness was such that she did not go out of the house for several
      days. There came a morning which broke in fog and mist, behind which the
      dawn could be discerned in greenish grey; and the outlines of the tents,
      and the rows of horses at the ropes. The smoke from the canteen fires
      drooped heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spot at the bottom of the garden where she had been accustomed to
      climb the wall to meet Matthaus, was the only inch of English ground in
      which she took any interest; and in spite of the disagreeable haze
      prevailing she walked out there till she reached the well-known corner.
      Every blade of grass was weighted with little liquid globes, and slugs and
      snails had crept out upon the plots. She could hear the usual faint noises
      from the camp, and in the other direction the trot of farmers on the road
      to the town, for it was market-day. She observed that her frequent visits
      to this corner had quite trodden down the grass in the angle of the wall,
      and left marks of garden soil on the stepping-stones by which she had
      mounted to look over the top. Seldom having gone there till dusk, she had
      not considered that her traces might be visible by day. Perhaps it was
      these which had revealed her trysts to her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      While she paused in melancholy regard, she fancied that the customary
      sounds from the tents were changing their character. Indifferent as
      Phyllis was to camp doings now, she mounted by the steps to the old place.
      What she beheld at first awed and perplexed her; then she stood rigid, her
      fingers hooked to the wall, her eyes staring out of her head, and her face
      as if hardened to stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the open green stretching before her all the regiments in the camp were
      drawn up in line, in the mid-front of which two empty coffins lay on the
      ground. The unwonted sounds which she had noticed came from an advancing
      procession. It consisted of the band of the York Hussars playing a dead
      march; next two soldiers of that regiment in a mourning coach, guarded on
      each side, and accompanied by two priests. Behind came a crowd of rustics
      who had been attracted by the event. The melancholy procession marched
      along the front of the line, returned to the centre, and halted beside the
      coffins, where the two condemned men were blindfolded, and each placed
      kneeling on his coffin; a few minutes pause was now given, while they
      prayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A firing-party of twenty-four men stood ready with levelled carbines. The
      commanding officer, who had his sword drawn, waved it through some cuts of
      the sword-exercise till he reached the downward stroke, whereat the
      firing-party discharged their volley. The two victims fell, one upon his
      face across his coffin, the other backwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the volley resounded there arose a shriek from the wall of Dr. Grove's
      garden, and some one fell down inside; but nobody among the spectators
      without noticed it at the time. The two executed Hussars were Matthaus
      Tina and his friend Christoph. The soldiers on guard placed the bodies in
      the coffins almost instantly; but the colonel of the regiment, an
      Englishman, rode up and exclaimed in a stern voice: 'Turn them out-as an
      example to the men!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The coffins were lifted endwise, and the dead Germans flung out upon their
      faces on the grass. Then all the regiments wheeled in sections, and
      marched past the spot in slow time. When the survey was over the corpses
      were again coffined, and borne away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Dr. Grove, attracted by the noise of the volley, had rushed out
      into his garden, where he saw his wretched daughter lying motionless
      against the wall. She was taken indoors, but it was long before she
      recovered consciousness; and for weeks they despaired of her reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      It transpired that the luckless deserters from the York Hussars had cut
      the boat from her moorings in the adjacent harbour, according to their
      plan, and, with two other comrades who were smarting under ill-treatment
      from their colonel, had sailed in safety across the Channel. But mistaking
      their bearings they steered into Jersey, thinking that island the French
      coast. Here they were perceived to be deserters, and delivered up to the
      authorities. Matthaus and Christoph interceded for the other two at the
      court-martial, saying that it was entirely by the former's representations
      that these were induced to go. Their sentence was accordingly commuted to
      flogging, the death punishment being reserved for their leaders.

      The visitor to the well-known old Georgian watering-place, who may care to
      ramble to the neighbouring village under the hills, and examine the
      register of burials, will there find two entries in these words:-
    </p>
    <p>
      'Matth:-Tina (Corpl.) in His Majesty's Regmt. of York Hussars, and Shot
      for Desertion, was Buried June 30th, 1801, aged 22 years. Born in the town
      of Sarrbruk, Germany.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Christoph Bless, belonging to His Majesty's Regmt. of York Hussars, who
      was Shot for Desertion, was Buried June 30th, 1801, aged 22 years. Born at
      Lothaargen, Alsatia.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Their graves were dug at the back of the little church, near the wall.
      There is no memorial to mark the spot, but Phyllis pointed it out to me.
      While she lived she used to keep their mounds neat; but now they are
      overgrown with nettles, and sunk nearly flat. The older villagers,
      however, who know of the episode from their parents, still recollect the
      place where the soldiers lie. Phyllis lies near.

      THE FIDDLER OF THE REELS
    </h2>
    <p>
      'Talking of Exhibitions, World's Fairs, and what not,' said the old
      gentleman, 'I would not go round the corner to see a dozen of them
      nowadays. The only exhibition that ever made, or ever will make, any
      impression upon my imagination was the first of the series, the parent of
      them all, and now a thing of old times-the Great Exhibition of 1851, in
      Hyde Park, London. None of the younger generation can realize the sense of
      novelty it produced in us who were then in our prime. A noun substantive
      went so far as to become an adjective in honour of the occasion. It was
      "exhibition" hat, "exhibition" razor-strop, "exhibition" watch; nay, even
      "exhibition" weather, "exhibition" spirits, sweethearts, babies, wives-for
      the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      'For South Wessex, the year formed in many ways an extraordinary
      chronological frontier or transit-line, at which there occurred what one
      might call a precipice in Time. As in a geological "fault," we had
      presented to us a sudden bringing of ancient and modern into absolute
      contact, such as probably in no other single year since the Conquest was
      ever witnessed in this part of the country.'
    </p>
    <p>
      These observations led us onward to talk of the different personages,
      gentle and simple, who lived and moved within our narrow and peaceful
      horizon at that time; and of three people in particular, whose queer
      little history was oddly touched at points by the Exhibition, more
      concerned with it than that of anybody else who dwelt in those outlying
      shades of the world, Stickleford, Mellstock, and Egdon. First in
      prominence among these three came Wat Ollamoor-if that were his real
      name-whom the seniors in our party had known well.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a woman's man, they said,-supremely so-externally little else. To
      men he was not attractive; perhaps a little repulsive at times. Musician,
      dandy, and company-man in practice; veterinary surgeon in theory, he
      lodged awhile in Mellstock village, coming from nobody knew where; though
      some said his first appearance in this neighbourhood had been as
      fiddle-player in a show at Greenhill Fair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many a worthy villager envied him his power over unsophisticated
      maidenhood-a power which seemed sometimes to have a touch of the weird and
      wizardly in it. Personally he was not ill-favoured, though rather
      un-English, his complexion being a rich olive, his rank hair dark and
      rather clammy-made still clammier by secret ointments, which, when he came
      fresh to a party, caused him to smell like 'boys'-love' (southernwood)
      steeped in lamp-oil. On occasion he wore curls-a double row-running almost
      horizontally around his head. But as these were sometimes noticeably
      absent, it was concluded that they were not altogether of Nature's making.
      By girls whose love for him had turned to hatred he had been nicknamed
      'Mop,' from this abundance of hair, which was long enough to rest upon his
      shoulders; as time passed the name more and more prevailed.
    </p>
    <p>
      His fiddling possibly had the most to do with the fascination he
      exercised, for, to speak fairly, it could claim for itself a most peculiar
      and personal quality, like that in a moving preacher. There were tones in
      it which bred the immediate conviction that indolence and averseness to
      systematic application were all that lay between 'Mop' and the career of a
      second Paganini.
    </p>
    <p>
      While playing he invariably closed his eyes; using no notes, and, as it
      were, allowing the violin to wander on at will into the most plaintive
      passages ever heard by rustic man. There was a certain lingual character
      in the supplicatory expressions he produced, which would well nigh have
      drawn an ache from the heart of a gate-post. He could make any child in
      the parish, who was at all sensitive to music, burst into tears in a few
      minutes by simply fiddling one of the old dance-tunes he almost entirely
      affected-country jigs, reels, and 'Favourite Quick Steps' of the last
      century-some mutilated remains of which even now reappear as nameless
      phantoms in new quadrilles and gallops, where they are recognized only by
      the curious, or by such old-fashioned and far- between people as have been
      thrown with men like Wat Ollamoor in their early life.
    </p>
    <p>
      His date was a little later than that of the old Mellstock quire-band
      which comprised the Dewys, Mail, and the rest-in fact, he did not rise
      above the horizon thereabout till those well-known musicians were
      disbanded as ecclesiastical functionaries. In their honest love of
      thoroughness they despised the new man's style. Theophilus Dewy (Reuben
      the tranter's younger brother) used to say there was no 'plumness' in
      it-no bowing, no solidity-it was all fantastical. And probably this was
      true. Anyhow, Mop had, very obviously, never bowed a note of church- music
      from his birth; he never once sat in the gallery of Mellstock church where
      the others had tuned their venerable psalmody so many hundreds of times;
      had never, in all likelihood, entered a church at all. All were devil's
      tunes in his repertory. 'He could no more play the Wold Hundredth to his
      true time than he could play the brazen serpent,' the tranter would say.
      (The brazen serpent was supposed in Mellstock to be a musical instrument
      particularly hard to blow.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Occasionally Mop could produce the aforesaid moving effect upon the souls
      of grown-up persons, especially young women of fragile and responsive
      organization. Such an one was Car'line Aspent. Though she was already
      engaged to be married before she met him, Car'line, of them all, was the
      most influenced by Mop Ollamoor's heart-stealing melodies, to her
      discomfort, nay, positive pain and ultimate injury. She was a pretty,
      invocating, weak-mouthed girl, whose chief defect as a companion with her
      sex was a tendency to peevishness now and then. At this time she was not a
      resident in Mellstock parish where Mop lodged, but lived some miles off at
      Stickleford, farther down the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      How and where she first made acquaintance with him and his fiddling is not
      truly known, but the story was that it either began or was developed on
      one spring evening, when, in passing through Lower Mellstock, she chanced
      to pause on the bridge near his house to rest herself, and languidly
      leaned over the parapet. Mop was standing on his door-step, as was his
      custom, spinning the insidious thread of semi- and demi-semi- quavers from
      the E string of his fiddle for the benefit of passers-by, and laughing as
      the tears rolled down the cheeks of the little children hanging around
      him. Car'line pretended to be engrossed with the rippling of the stream
      under the arches, but in reality she was listening, as he knew. Presently
      the aching of the heart seized her simultaneously with a wild desire to
      glide airily in the mazes of an infinite dance. To shake off the
      fascination she resolved to go on, although it would be necessary to pass
      him as he played. On stealthily glancing ahead at the performer, she found
      to her relief that his eyes were closed in abandonment to instrumentation,
      and she strode on boldly. But when closer her step grew timid, her tread
      convulsed itself more and more accordantly with the time of the melody,
      till she very nearly danced along. Gaining another glance at him when
      immediately opposite, she saw that one of his eyes was open, quizzing her
      as he smiled at her emotional state. Her gait could not divest itself of
      its compelled capers till she had gone a long way past the house; and
      Car'line was unable to shake off the strange infatuation for hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that day, whenever there was to be in the neighbourhood a dance to
      which she could get an invitation, and where Mop Ollamoor was to be the
      musician, Car'line contrived to be present, though it sometimes involved a
      walk of several miles; for he did not play so often in Stickleford as
      elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next evidences of his influence over her were singular enough, and it
      would require a neurologist to fully explain them. She would be sitting
      quietly, any evening after dark, in the house of her father, the parish
      clerk, which stood in the middle of Stickleford village street, this being
      the highroad between Lower Mellstock and Moreford, five miles eastward.
      Here, without a moment's warning, and in the midst of a general
      conversation between her father, sister, and the young man before alluded
      to, who devotedly wooed her in ignorance of her infatuation, she would
      start from her seat in the chimney-corner as if she had received a
      galvanic shock, and spring convulsively towards the ceiling; then she
      would burst into tears, and it was not till some half- hour had passed
      that she grew calm as usual. Her father, knowing her hysterical
      tendencies, was always excessively anxious about this trait in his
      youngest girl, and feared the attack to be a species of epileptic fit. Not
      so her sister Julia. Julia had found out what was the cause. At the moment
      before the jumping, only an exceptionally sensitive ear situated in the
      chimney-nook could have caught from down the flue the beat of a man's
      footstep along the highway without. But it was in that footfall, for which
      she had been waiting, that the origin of Car'line's involuntary springing
      lay. The pedestrian was Mop Ollamoor, as the girl well knew; but his
      business that way was not to visit her; he sought another woman whom he
      spoke of as his Intended, and who lived at Moreford, two miles farther on.
      On one, and only one, occasion did it happen that Car'line could not
      control her utterance; it was when her sister alone chanced to be present.
      'Oh-oh-oh-!' she cried. 'He's going to her, and not coming to me!'
    </p>
    <p>
      To do the fiddler justice he had not at first thought greatly of, or
      spoken much to, this girl of impressionable mould. But he had soon found
      out her secret, and could not resist a little by-play with her too easily
      hurt heart, as an interlude between his more serious performances at
      Moreford. The two became well acquainted, though only by stealth, hardly a
      soul in Stickleford except her sister, and her lover Ned Hipcroft, being
      aware of the attachment. Her father disapproved of her coldness to Ned;
      her sister, too, hoped she might get over this nervous passion for a man
      of whom so little was known. The ultimate result was that Car'line's manly
      and simple wooer Edward found his suit becoming practically hopeless. He
      was a respectable mechanic, in a far sounder position than Mop the nominal
      horse-doctor; but when, before leaving her, Ned put his flat and final
      question, would she marry him, then and there, now or never, it was with
      little expectation of obtaining more than the negative she gave him.
      Though her father supported him and her sister supported him, he could not
      play the fiddle so as to draw your soul out of your body like a spider's
      thread, as Mop did, till you felt as limp as withy-wind and yearned for
      something to cling to. Indeed, Hipcroft had not the slightest ear for
      music; could not sing two notes in tune, much less play them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The No he had expected and got from her, in spite of a preliminary
      encouragement, gave Ned a new start in life. It had been uttered in such a
      tone of sad entreaty that he resolved to persecute her no more; she should
      not even be distressed by a sight of his form in the distant perspective
      of the street and lane. He left the place, and his natural course was to
      London.
    </p>
    <p>
      The railway to South Wessex was in process of construction, but it was not
      as yet opened for traffic; and Hipcroft reached the capital by a six days'
      trudge on foot, as many a better man had done before him. He was one of
      the last of the artisan class who used that now extinct method of travel
      to the great centres of labour, so customary then from time immemorial.
    </p>
    <p>
      In London he lived and worked regularly at his trade. More fortunate than
      many, his disinterested willingness recommended him from the first. During
      the ensuing four years he was never out of employment. He neither advanced
      nor receded in the modern sense; he improved as a workman, but he did not
      shift one jot in social position. About his love for Car'line he
      maintained a rigid silence. No doubt he often thought of her; but being
      always occupied, and having no relations at Stickleford, he held no
      communication with that part of the country, and showed no desire to
      return. In his quiet lodging in Lambeth he moved about after working-hours
      with the facility of a woman, doing his own cooking, attending to his
      stocking-heels, and shaping himself by degrees to a life-long
      bachelorhood. For this conduct one is bound to advance the canonical
      reason that time could not efface from his heart the image of little
      Car'line Aspent-and it may be in part true; but there was also the
      inference that his was a nature not greatly dependent upon the
      ministrations of the other sex for its comforts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fourth year of his residence as a mechanic in London was the year of
      the Hyde-Park Exhibition already mentioned, and at the construction of
      this huge glass-house, then unexampled in the world's history, he worked
      daily. It was an era of great hope and activity among the nations and
      industries. Though Hipcroft was, in his small way, a central man in the
      movement, he plodded on with his usual outward placidity. Yet for him,
      too, the year was destined to have its surprises, for when the bustle of
      getting the building ready for the opening day was past, the ceremonies
      had been witnessed, and people were flocking thither from all parts of the
      globe, he received a letter from Car'line. Till that day the silence of
      four years between himself and Stickleford had never been broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      She informed her old lover, in an uncertain penmanship which suggested a
      trembling hand, of the trouble she had been put to in ascertaining his
      address, and then broached the subject which had prompted her to write.
      Four years ago, she said with the greatest delicacy of which she was
      capable, she had been so foolish as to refuse him. Her wilful wrong-
      headedness had since been a grief to her many times, and of late
      particularly. As for Mr. Ollamoor, he had been absent almost as long as
      Ned-she did not know where. She would gladly marry Ned now if he were to
      ask her again, and be a tender little wife to him till her life's end.
    </p>
    <p>
      A tide of warm feeling must have surged through Ned Hipcroft's frame on
      receipt of this news, if we may judge by the issue. Unquestionably he
      loved her still, even if not to the exclusion of every other happiness.
      This from his Car'line, she who had been dead to him these many years,
      alive to him again as of old, was in itself a pleasant, gratifying thing.
      Ned had grown so resigned to, or satisfied with, his lonely lot, that he
      probably would not have shown much jubilation at anything. Still, a
      certain ardour of preoccupation, after his first surprise, revealed how
      deeply her confession of faith in him had stirred him. Measured and
      methodical in his ways, he did not answer the letter that day, nor the
      next, nor the next. He was having 'a good think.' When he did answer it,
      there was a great deal of sound reasoning mixed in with the unmistakable
      tenderness of his reply; but the tenderness itself was sufficient to
      reveal that he was pleased with her straightforward frankness; that the
      anchorage she had once obtained in his heart was renewable, if it had not
      been continuously firm.
    </p>
    <p>
      He told her-and as he wrote his lips twitched humorously over the few
      gentle words of raillery he indited among the rest of his sentences-that
      it was all very well for her to come round at this time of day. Why
      wouldn't she have him when he wanted her? She had no doubt learned that he
      was not married, but suppose his affections had since been fixed on
      another? She ought to beg his pardon. Still, he was not the man to forget
      her. But considering how he had been used, and what he had suffered, she
      could not quite expect him to go down to Stickleford and fetch her. But if
      she would come to him, and say she was sorry, as was only fair; why, yes,
      he would marry her, knowing what a good little woman she was at the core.
      He added that the request for her to come to him was a less one to make
      than it would have been when he first left Stickleford, or even a few
      months ago; for the new railway into South Wessex was now open, and there
      had just begun to be run wonderfully contrived special trains, called
      excursion-trains, on account of the Great Exhibition; so that she could
      come up easily alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said in her reply how good it was of him to treat her so generously,
      after her hot and cold treatment of him; that though she felt frightened
      at the magnitude of the journey, and was never as yet in a railway- train,
      having only seen one pass at a distance, she embraced his offer with all
      her heart; and would, indeed, own to him how sorry she was, and beg his
      pardon, and try to be a good wife always, and make up for lost time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The remaining details of when and where were soon settled, Car'line
      informing him, for her ready identification in the crowd, that she would
      be wearing 'my new sprigged-laylock cotton gown,' and Ned gaily responding
      that, having married her the morning after her arrival, he would make a
      day of it by taking her to the Exhibition. One early summer afternoon,
      accordingly, he came from his place of work, and hastened towards Waterloo
      Station to meet her. It was as wet and chilly as an English June day can
      occasionally be, but as he waited on the platform in the drizzle he glowed
      inwardly, and seemed to have something to live for again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 'excursion-train'-an absolutely new departure in the history of
      travel-was still a novelty on the Wessex line, and probably everywhere.
      Crowds of people had flocked to all the stations on the way up to witness
      the unwonted sight of so long a train's passage, even where they did not
      take advantage of the opportunity it offered. The seats for the humbler
      class of travellers in these early experiments in steam- locomotion, were
      open trucks, without any protection whatever from the wind and rain; and
      damp weather having set in with the afternoon, the unfortunate occupants
      of these vehicles were, on the train drawing up at the London terminus,
      found to be in a pitiable condition from their long journey; blue-faced,
      stiff-necked, sneezing, rain-beaten, chilled to the marrow, many of the
      men being hatless; in fact, they resembled people who had been out all
      night in an open boat on a rough sea, rather than inland excursionists for
      pleasure. The women had in some degree protected themselves by turning up
      the skirts of their gowns over their heads, but as by this arrangement
      they were additionally exposed about the hips, they were all more or less
      in a sorry plight.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the bustle and crush of alighting forms of both sexes which followed
      the entry of the huge concatenation into the station, Ned Hipcroft soon
      discerned the slim little figure his eye was in search of, in the sprigged
      lilac, as described. She came up to him with a frightened smile-still
      pretty, though so damp, weather-beaten, and shivering from long exposure
      to the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O Ned!' she sputtered, 'I-I-' He clasped her in his arms and kissed her,
      whereupon she burst into a flood of tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are wet, my poor dear! I hope you'll not get cold,' he said. And
      surveying her and her multifarious surrounding packages, he noticed that
      by the hand she led a toddling child-a little girl of three or so-whose
      hood was as clammy and tender face as blue as those of the other
      travellers.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who is this-somebody you know?' asked Ned curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, Ned. She's mine.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yours?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes-my own!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Your own child?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well-as God's in-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ned, I didn't name it in my letter, because, you see, it would have been
      so hard to explain! I thought that when we met I could tell you how she
      happened to be born, so much better than in writing! I hope you'll excuse
      it this once, dear Ned, and not scold me, now I've come so many, many
      miles!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'This means Mr. Mop Ollamoor, I reckon!' said Hipcroft, gazing palely at
      them from the distance of the yard or two to which he had withdrawn with a
      start.
    </p>
    <p>
      Car'line gasped. 'But he's been gone away for years!' she supplicated.
      'And I never had a young man before! And I was so onlucky to be catched
      the first time, though some of the girls down there go on like anything!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Ned remained in silence, pondering.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You'll forgive me, dear Ned?' she added, beginning to sob outright. 'I
      haven't taken 'ee in after all, because-because you can pack us back
      again, if you want to; though 'tis hundreds o' miles, and so wet, and
      night a-coming on, and I with no money!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What the devil can I do!' Hipcroft groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      A more pitiable picture than the pair of helpless creatures presented was
      never seen on a rainy day, as they stood on the great, gaunt, puddled
      platform, a whiff of drizzle blowing under the roof upon them now and
      then; the pretty attire in which they had started from Stickleford in the
      early morning bemuddled and sodden, weariness on their faces, and fear of
      him in their eyes; for the child began to look as if she thought she too
      had done some wrong, remaining in an appalled silence till the tears
      rolled down her chubby cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What's the matter, my little maid?' said Ned mechanically.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I do want to go home!' she let out, in tones that told of a bursting
      heart. 'And my totties be cold, an' I shan't have no bread an' butter no
      more!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't know what to say to it all!' declared Ned, his own eye moist as
      he turned and walked a few steps with his head down; then regarded them
      again point blank. From the child escaped troubled breaths and silently
      welling tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Want some bread and butter, do 'ee?' he said, with factitious hardness.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ye-e-s!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I daresay I can get 'ee a bit! Naturally, you must want some. And
      you, too, for that matter, Car'line.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I do feel a little hungered. But I can keep it off,' she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Folk shouldn't do that,' he said gruffly. . . . 'There come along!' he
      caught up the child, as he added, 'You must bide here to-night, anyhow, I
      s'pose! What can you do otherwise? I'll get 'ee some tea and victuals; and
      as for this job, I'm sure I don't know what to say! This is the way out.'
    </p>
    <p>
      They pursued their way, without speaking, to Ned's lodgings, which were
      not far off. There he dried them and made them comfortable, and prepared
      tea; they thankfully sat down. The ready-made household of which he
      suddenly found himself the head imparted a cosy aspect to his room, and a
      paternal one to himself. Presently he turned to the child and kissed her
      now blooming cheeks; and, looking wistfully at Car'line, kissed her also.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't see how I can send 'ee back all them miles,' he growled, 'now
      you've come all the way o' purpose to join me. But you must trust me,
      Car'line, and show you've real faith in me. Well, do you feel better now,
      my little woman?'
    </p>
    <p>
      The child nodded, her mouth being otherwise occupied.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I did trust you, Ned, in coming; and I shall always!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, without any definite agreement to forgive her, he tacitly acquiesced
      in the fate that Heaven had sent him; and on the day of their marriage
      (which was not quite so soon as he had expected it could be, on account of
      the time necessary for banns) he took her to the Exhibition when they came
      back from church, as he had promised. While standing near a large mirror
      in one of the courts devoted to furniture, Car'line started, for in the
      glass appeared the reflection of a form exactly resembling Mop
      Ollamoor's-so exactly, that it seemed impossible to believe anybody but
      that artist in person to be the original. On passing round the objects
      which hemmed in Ned, her, and the child from a direct view, no Mop was to
      be seen. Whether he were really in London or not at that time was never
      known; and Car'line always stoutly denied that her readiness to go and
      meet Ned in town arose from any rumour that Mop had also gone thither;
      which denial there was no reasonable ground for doubting.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then the year glided away, and the Exhibition folded itself up and
      became a thing of the past. The park trees that had been enclosed for six
      months were again exposed to the winds and storms, and the sod grew green
      anew. Ned found that Car'line resolved herself into a very good wife and
      companion, though she had made herself what is called cheap to him; but in
      that she was like another domestic article, a cheap tea-pot, which often
      brews better tea than a dear one. One autumn Hipcroft found himself with
      but little work to do, and a prospect of less for the winter. Both being
      country born and bred, they fancied they would like to live again in their
      natural atmosphere. It was accordingly decided between them that they
      should leave the pent-up London lodging, and that Ned should seek out
      employment near his native place, his wife and her daughter staying with
      Car'line's father during the search for occupation and an abode of their
      own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tinglings of pleasure pervaded Car'line's spasmodic little frame as she
      journeyed down with Ned to the place she had left two or three years
      before, in silence and under a cloud. To return to where she had once been
      despised, a smiling London wife with a distinct London accent, was a
      triumph which the world did not witness every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The train did not stop at the petty roadside station that lay nearest to
      Stickleford, and the trio went on to Casterbridge. Ned thought it a good
      opportunity to make a few preliminary inquiries for employment at
      workshops in the borough where he had been known; and feeling cold from
      her journey, and it being dry underfoot and only dusk as yet, with a moon
      on the point of rising, Car'line and her little girl walked on toward
      Stickleford, leaving Ned to follow at a quicker pace, and pick her up at a
      certain half-way house, widely known as an inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman and child pursued the well-remembered way comfortably enough,
      though they were both becoming wearied. In the course of three miles they
      had passed Heedless-William's Pond, the familiar landmark by Bloom's End,
      and were drawing near the Quiet Woman Inn, a lone roadside hostel on the
      lower verge of the Egdon Heath, since and for many years abolished. In
      stepping up towards it Car'line heard more voices within than had formerly
      been customary at such an hour, and she learned that an auction of fat
      stock had been held near the spot that afternoon. The child would be the
      better for a rest as well as herself, she thought, and she entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The guests and customers overflowed into the passage, and Car'line had no
      sooner crossed the threshold than a man whom she remembered by sight came
      forward with glass and mug in his hands towards a friend leaning against
      the wall; but, seeing her, very gallantly offered her a drink of the
      liquor, which was gin-and-beer hot, pouring her out a tumblerful and
      saying, in a moment or two: 'Surely, 'tis little Car'line Aspent that
      was-down at Stickleford?'
    </p>
    <p>
      She assented, and, though she did not exactly want this beverage, she
      drank it since it was offered, and her entertainer begged her to come in
      farther and sit down. Once within the room she found that all the persons
      present were seated close against the walls, and there being a chair
      vacant she did the same. An explanation of their position occurred the
      next moment. In the opposite corner stood Mop, rosining his bow and
      looking just the same as ever. The company had cleared the middle of the
      room for dancing, and they were about to dance again. As she wore a veil
      to keep off the wind she did not think he had recognized her, or could
      possibly guess the identity of the child; and to her satisfied surprise
      she found that she could confront him quite calmly-mistress of herself in
      the dignity her London life had given her. Before she had quite emptied
      her glass the dance was called, the dancers formed in two lines, the music
      sounded, and the figure began.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then matters changed for Car'line. A tremor quickened itself to life in
      her, and her hand so shook that she could hardly set down her glass. It
      was not the dance nor the dancers, but the notes of that old violin which
      thrilled the London wife, these having still all the witchery that she had
      so well known of yore, and under which she had used to lose her power of
      independent will. How it all came back! There was the fiddling figure
      against the wall; the large, oily, mop-like head of him, and beneath the
      mop the face with closed eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the first moments of paralyzed reverie the familiar tune in the
      familiar rendering made her laugh and shed tears simultaneously. Then a
      man at the bottom of the dance, whose partner had dropped away, stretched
      out his hand and beckoned to her to take the place. She did not want to
      dance; she entreated by signs to be left where she was, but she was
      entreating of the tune and its player rather than of the dancing man. The
      saltatory tendency which the fiddler and his cunning instrument had ever
      been able to start in her was seizing Car'line just as it had done in
      earlier years, possibly assisted by the gin-and-beer hot. Tired as she was
      she grasped her little girl by the hand, and plunging in at the bottom of
      the figure, whirled about with the rest. She found that her companions
      were mostly people of the neighbouring hamlets and farms-Bloom's End,
      Mellstock, Lewgate, and elsewhere; and by degrees she was recognized as
      she convulsively danced on, wishing that Mop would cease and let her heart
      rest from the aching he caused, and her feet also.
    </p>
    <p>
      After long and many minutes the dance ended, when she was urged to fortify
      herself with more gin-and-beer; which she did, feeling very weak and
      overpowered with hysteric emotion. She refrained from unveiling, to keep
      Mop in ignorance of her presence, if possible. Several of the guests
      having left, Car'line hastily wiped her lips and also turned to go; but,
      according to the account of some who remained, at that very moment a
      five-handed reel was proposed, in which two or three begged her to join.
    </p>
    <p>
      She declined on the plea of being tired and having to walk to Stickleford,
      when Mop began aggressively tweedling 'My Fancy-Lad,' in D major, as the
      air to which the reel was to be footed. He must have recognized her,
      though she did not know it, for it was the strain of all seductive strains
      which she was least able to resist-the one he had played when she was
      leaning over the bridge at the date of their first acquaintance. Car'line
      stepped despairingly into the middle of the room with the other four.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reels were resorted to hereabouts at this time by the more robust spirits,
      for the reduction of superfluous energy which the ordinary figure-dances
      were not powerful enough to exhaust. As everybody knows, or does not know,
      the five reelers stood in the form of a cross, the reel being performed by
      each line of three alternately, the persons who successively came to the
      middle place dancing in both directions. Car'line soon found herself in
      this place, the axis of the whole performance, and could not get out of
      it, the tune turning into the first part without giving her opportunity.
      And now she began to suspect that Mop did know her, and was doing this on
      purpose, though whenever she stole a glance at him his closed eyes
      betokened obliviousness to everything outside his own brain. She continued
      to wend her way through the figure of 8 that was formed by her course, the
      fiddler introducing into his notes the wild and agonizing sweetness of a
      living voice in one too highly wrought; its pathos running high and
      running low in endless variation, projecting through her nerves
      excruciating spasms, a sort of blissful torture. The room swam, the tune
      was endless; and in about a quarter of an hour the only other woman in the
      figure dropped out exhausted, and sank panting on a bench.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reel instantly resolved itself into a four-handed one. Car'line would
      have given anything to leave off; but she had, or fancied she had, no
      power, while Mop played such tunes; and thus another ten minutes slipped
      by, a haze of dust now clouding the candles, the floor being of stone,
      sanded. Then another dancer fell out-one of the men-and went into the
      passage, in a frantic search for liquor. To turn the figure into a
      three-handed reel was the work of a second, Mop modulating at the same
      time into 'The Fairy Dance,' as better suited to the contracted movement,
      and no less one of those foods of love which, as manufactured by his bow,
      had always intoxicated her.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a reel for three there was no rest whatever, and four or five minutes
      were enough to make her remaining two partners, now thoroughly blown,
      stamp their last bar and, like their predecessors, limp off into the next
      room to get something to drink. Car'line, half-stifled inside her veil,
      was left dancing alone, the apartment now being empty of everybody save
      herself, Mop, and their little girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      She flung up the veil, and cast her eyes upon him, as if imploring him to
      withdraw himself and his acoustic magnetism from the atmosphere. Mop
      opened one of his own orbs, as though for the first time, fixed it
      peeringly upon her, and smiling dreamily, threw into his strains the
      reserve of expression which he could not afford to waste on a big and
      noisy dance. Crowds of little chromatic subtleties, capable of drawing
      tears from a statue, proceeded straightway from the ancient fiddle, as if
      it were dying of the emotion which had been pent up within it ever since
      its banishment from some Italian city where it first took shape and sound.
      There was that in the look of Mop's one dark eye which said: 'You cannot
      leave off, dear, whether you would or no!' and it bred in her a paroxysm
      of desperation that defied him to tire her down.
    </p>
    <p>
      She thus continued to dance alone, defiantly as she thought, but in truth
      slavishly and abjectly, subject to every wave of the melody, and probed by
      the gimlet-like gaze of her fascinator's open eye; keeping up at the same
      time a feeble smile in his face, as a feint to signify it was still her
      own pleasure which led her on. A terrified embarrassment as to what she
      could say to him if she were to leave off, had its unrecognized share in
      keeping her going. The child, who was beginning to be distressed by the
      strange situation, came up and said: 'Stop, mother, stop, and let's go
      home!' as she seized Car'line's hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Car'line sank staggering to the floor; and rolling over on her
      face, prone she remained. Mop's fiddle thereupon emitted an elfin shriek
      of finality; stepping quickly down from the nine-gallon beer-cask which
      had formed his rostrum, he went to the little girl, who disconsolately
      bent over her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      The guests who had gone into the back-room for liquor and change of air,
      hearing something unusual, trooped back hitherward, where they endeavoured
      to revive poor, weak Car'line by blowing her with the bellows and opening
      the window. Ned, her husband, who had been detained in Casterbridge, as
      aforesaid, came along the road at this juncture, and hearing excited
      voices through the open casement, and to his great surprise, the mention
      of his wife's name, he entered amid the rest upon the scene. Car'line was
      now in convulsions, weeping violently, and for a long time nothing could
      be done with her. While he was sending for a cart to take her onward to
      Stickleford Hipcroft anxiously inquired how it had all happened; and then
      the assembly explained that a fiddler formerly known in the locality had
      lately revisited his old haunts, and had taken upon himself without
      invitation to play that evening at the inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ned demanded the fiddler's name, and they said Ollamoor.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah!' exclaimed Ned, looking round him. 'Where is he, and where-where's my
      little girl?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Ollamoor had disappeared, and so had the child. Hipcroft was in ordinary a
      quiet and tractable fellow, but a determination which was to be feared
      settled in his face now. 'Blast him!' he cried. 'I'll beat his skull in
      for'n, if I swing for it to-morrow!'
    </p>
    <p>
      He had rushed to the poker which lay on the hearth, and hastened down the
      passage, the people following. Outside the house, on the other side of the
      highway, a mass of dark heath-land rose sullenly upward to its not easily
      accessible interior, a ravined plateau, whereon jutted into the sky, at
      the distance of a couple of miles, the fir-woods of Mistover backed by the
      Yalbury coppices-a place of Dantesque gloom at this hour, which would have
      afforded secure hiding for a battery of artillery, much less a man and a
      child.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some other men plunged thitherward with him, and more went along the road.
      They were gone about twenty minutes altogether, returning without result
      to the inn. Ned sat down in the settle, and clasped his forehead with his
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well-what a fool the man is, and hev been all these years, if he thinks
      the child his, as a' do seem to!' they whispered. 'And everybody else
      knowing otherwise!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, I don't think 'tis mine!' cried Ned hoarsely, as he looked up from
      his hands. 'But she is mine, all the same! Ha'n't I nussed her? Ha'n't I
      fed her and teached her? Ha'n't I played wi' her? O, little Carry-gone
      with that rogue-gone!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You ha'n't lost your mis'ess, anyhow,' they said to console him. 'She's
      throwed up the sperrits, and she is feeling better, and she's more to 'ee
      than a child that isn't yours.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She isn't! She's not so particular much to me, especially now she's lost
      the little maid! But Carry's everything!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, ver' like you'll find her to-morrow.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah-but shall I? Yet he can't hurt her-surely he can't! Well-how's
      Car'line now? I am ready. Is the cart here?'
    </p>
    <p>
      She was lifted into the vehicle, and they sadly lumbered on toward
      Stickleford. Next day she was calmer; but the fits were still upon her;
      and her will seemed shattered. For the child she appeared to show
      singularly little anxiety, though Ned was nearly distracted. It was
      nevertheless quite expected that the impish Mop would restore the lost one
      after a freak of a day or two; but time went on, and neither he nor she
      could be heard of, and Hipcroft murmured that perhaps he was exercising
      upon her some unholy musical charm, as he had done upon Car'line herself.
      Weeks passed, and still they could obtain no clue either to the fiddler's
      whereabouts or the girl's; and how he could have induced her to go with
      him remained a mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Ned, who had obtained only temporary employment in the neighbourhood,
      took a sudden hatred toward his native district, and a rumour reaching his
      ears through the police that a somewhat similar man and child had been
      seen at a fair near London, he playing a violin, she dancing on stilts, a
      new interest in the capital took possession of Hipcroft with an intensity
      which would scarcely allow him time to pack before returning thither.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not, however, find the lost one, though he made it the entire
      business of his over-hours to stand about in by-streets in the hope of
      discovering her, and would start up in the night, saying, 'That rascal's
      torturing her to maintain him!' To which his wife would answer peevishly,
      'Don't 'ee raft yourself so, Ned! You prevent my getting a bit o' rest! He
      won't hurt her!' and fall asleep again.
    </p>
    <p>
      That Carry and her father had emigrated to America was the general
      opinion; Mop, no doubt, finding the girl a highly desirable companion when
      he had trained her to keep him by her earnings as a dancer. There, for
      that matter, they may be performing in some capacity now, though he must
      be an old scamp verging on threescore-and-ten, and she a woman of
      four-and-forty.

      A TRADITION OF EIGHTEEN HUNDRED AND FOUR
    </h2>
    <p>
      The widely discussed possibility of an invasion of England through a
      Channel tunnel has more than once recalled old Solomon Selby's story to my
      mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The occasion on which I numbered myself among his audience was one evening
      when he was sitting in the yawning chimney-corner of the inn- kitchen,
      with some others who had gathered there, and I entered for shelter from
      the rain. Withdrawing the stem of his pipe from the dental notch in which
      it habitually rested, he leaned back in the recess behind him and smiled
      into the fire. The smile was neither mirthful nor sad, not precisely
      humorous nor altogether thoughtful. We who knew him recognized it in a
      moment: it was his narrative smile. Breaking off our few desultory remarks
      we drew up closer, and he thus began:-
    </p>
    <p>
      'My father, as you mid know, was a shepherd all his life, and lived out by
      the Cove four miles yonder, where I was born and lived likewise, till I
      moved here shortly afore I was married. The cottage that first knew me
      stood on the top of the down, near the sea; there was no house within a
      mile and a half of it; it was built o' purpose for the farm-shepherd, and
      had no other use. They tell me that it is now pulled down, but that you
      can see where it stood by the mounds of earth and a few broken bricks that
      are still lying about. It was a bleak and dreary place in winter-time, but
      in summer it was well enough, though the garden never came to much,
      because we could not get up a good shelter for the vegetables and currant
      bushes; and where there is much wind they don't thrive.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of all the years of my growing up the ones that bide clearest in my mind
      were eighteen hundred and three, four, and five. This was for two reasons:
      I had just then grown to an age when a child's eyes and ears take in and
      note down everything about him, and there was more at that date to bear in
      mind than there ever has been since with me. It was, as I need hardly tell
      ye, the time after the first peace, when Bonaparte was scheming his
      descent upon England. He had crossed the great Alp mountains, fought in
      Egypt, drubbed the Turks, the Austrians, and the Proossians, and now
      thought he'd have a slap at us. On the other side of the Channel, scarce
      out of sight and hail of a man standing on our English shore, the French
      army of a hundred and sixty thousand men and fifteen thousand horses had
      been brought together from all parts, and were drilling every day.
      Bonaparte had been three years a-making his preparations; and to ferry
      these soldiers and cannon and horses across he had contrived a couple of
      thousand flat-bottomed boats. These boats were small things, but
      wonderfully built. A good few of 'em were so made as to have a little
      stable on board each for the two horses that were to haul the cannon
      carried at the stern. To get in order all these, and other things
      required, he had assembled there five or six thousand fellows that worked
      at trades-carpenters, blacksmiths, wheelwrights, saddlers, and what not. O
      'twas a curious time!
    </p>
    <p>
      'Every morning Neighbour Boney would muster his multitude of soldiers on
      the beach, draw 'em up in line, practise 'em in the manoeuvre of
      embarking, horses and all, till they could do it without a single hitch.
      My father drove a flock of ewes up into Sussex that year, and as he went
      along the drover's track over the high downs thereabout he could see this
      drilling actually going on-the accoutrements of the rank and file
      glittering in the sun like silver. It was thought and always said by my
      uncle Job, sergeant of foot (who used to know all about these matters),
      that Bonaparte meant to cross with oars on a calm night. The grand query
      with us was, Where would my gentleman land? Many of the common people
      thought it would be at Dover; others, who knew how unlikely it was that
      any skilful general would make a business of landing just where he was
      expected, said he'd go either east into the River Thames, or west'ard to
      some convenient place, most likely one of the little bays inside the Isle
      of Portland, between the Beal and St. Alban's Head-and for choice the
      three-quarter-round Cove, screened from every mortal eye, that seemed made
      o' purpose, out by where we lived, and which I've climmed up with two tubs
      of brandy across my shoulders on scores o' dark nights in my younger days.
      Some had heard that a part o' the French fleet would sail right round
      Scotland, and come up the Channel to a suitable haven. However, there was
      much doubt upon the matter; and no wonder, for after-years proved that
      Bonaparte himself could hardly make up his mind upon that great and very
      particular point, where to land. His uncertainty came about in this wise,
      that he could get no news as to where and how our troops lay in waiting,
      and that his knowledge of possible places where flat-bottomed boats might
      be quietly run ashore, and the men they brought marshalled in order, was
      dim to the last degree. Being flat-bottomed, they didn't require a harbour
      for unshipping their cargo of men, but a good shelving beach away from
      sight, and with a fair open road toward London. How the question posed
      that great Corsican tyrant (as we used to call him), what pains he took to
      settle it, and, above all, what a risk he ran on one particular night in
      trying to do so, were known only to one man here and there; and certainly
      to no maker of newspapers or printer of books, or my account o't would not
      have had so many heads shaken over it as it has by gentry who only believe
      what they see in printed lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The flocks my father had charge of fed all about the downs near our
      house, overlooking the sea and shore each way for miles. In winter and
      early spring father was up a deal at nights, watching and tending the
      lambing. Often he'd go to bed early, and turn out at twelve or one; and on
      the other hand, he'd sometimes stay up till twelve or one, and then turn
      in to bed. As soon as I was old enough I used to help him, mostly in the
      way of keeping an eye upon the ewes while he was gone home to rest. This
      is what I was doing in a particular month in either the year four or
      five-I can't certainly fix which, but it was long before I was took away
      from the sheepkeeping to be bound prentice to a trade. Every night at that
      time I was at the fold, about half a mile, or it may be a little more,
      from our cottage, and no living thing at all with me but the ewes and
      young lambs. Afeard? No; I was never afeard of being alone at these times;
      for I had been reared in such an out-step place that the lack o' human
      beings at night made me less fearful than the sight of 'em. Directly I saw
      a man's shape after dark in a lonely place I was frightened out of my
      senses.
    </p>
    <p>
      'One day in that month we were surprised by a visit from my uncle Job, the
      sergeant in the Sixty-first foot, then in camp on the downs above King
      George's watering-place, several miles to the west yonder. Uncle Job
      dropped in about dusk, and went up with my father to the fold for an hour
      or two. Then he came home, had a drop to drink from the tub of sperrits
      that the smugglers kept us in for housing their liquor when they'd made a
      run, and for burning 'em off when there was danger. After that he
      stretched himself out on the settle to sleep. I went to bed: at one
      o'clock father came home, and waking me to go and take his place,
      according to custom, went to bed himself. On my way out of the house I
      passed Uncle Job on the settle. He opened his eyes, and upon my telling
      him where I was going he said it was a shame that such a youngster as I
      should go up there all alone; and when he had fastened up his stock and
      waist-belt he set off along with me, taking a drop from the sperrit-tub in
      a little flat bottle that stood in the corner-cupboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      'By and by we drew up to the fold, saw that all was right, and then, to
      keep ourselves warm, curled up in a heap of straw that lay inside the
      thatched hurdles we had set up to break the stroke of the wind when there
      was any. To-night, however, there was none. It was one of those very still
      nights when, if you stand on the high hills anywhere within two or three
      miles of the sea, you can hear the rise and fall of the tide along the
      shore, coming and going every few moments like a sort of great snore of
      the sleeping world. Over the lower ground there was a bit of a mist, but
      on the hill where we lay the air was clear, and the moon, then in her last
      quarter, flung a fairly good light on the grass and scattered straw.
    </p>
    <p>
      'While we lay there Uncle Job amused me by telling me strange stories of
      the wars he had served in and the wounds he had got. He had already fought
      the French in the Low Countries, and hoped to fight 'em again. His stories
      lasted so long that at last I was hardly sure that I was not a soldier
      myself, and had seen such service as he told of. The wonders of his tales
      quite bewildered my mind, till I fell asleep and dreamed of battle, smoke,
      and flying soldiers, all of a kind with the doings he had been bringing up
      to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How long my nap lasted I am not prepared to say. But some faint sounds
      over and above the rustle of the ewes in the straw, the bleat of the
      lambs, and the tinkle of the sheep-bell brought me to my waking senses.
      Uncle Job was still beside me; but he too had fallen asleep. I looked out
      from the straw, and saw what it was that had aroused me. Two men, in
      boat-cloaks, cocked hats, and swords, stood by the hurdles about twenty
      yards off.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I turned my ear thitherward to catch what they were saying, but though I
      heard every word o't, not one did I understand. They spoke in a tongue
      that was not ours-in French, as I afterward found. But if I could not gain
      the meaning of a word, I was shrewd boy enough to find out a deal of the
      talkers' business. By the light o' the moon I could see that one of 'em
      carried a roll of paper in his hand, while every moment he spoke quick to
      his comrade, and pointed right and left with the other hand to spots along
      the shore. There was no doubt that he was explaining to the second
      gentleman the shapes and features of the coast. What happened soon after
      made this still clearer to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      'All this time I had not waked Uncle Job, but now I began to be afeared
      that they might light upon us, because uncle breathed so heavily through's
      nose. I put my mouth to his ear and whispered, "Uncle Job."
    </p>
    <p>
      '"What is it, my boy?" he said, just as if he hadn't been asleep at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Hush!" says I. "Two French generals-"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"French?" says he.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Yes," says I. "Come to see where to land their army!"
    </p>
    <p>
      'I pointed 'em out; but I could say no more, for the pair were coming at
      that moment much nearer to where we lay. As soon as they got as near as
      eight or ten yards, the officer with a roll in his hand stooped down to a
      slanting hurdle, unfastened his roll upon it, and spread it out. Then
      suddenly he sprung a dark lantern open on the paper, and showed it to be a
      map.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"What be they looking at?" I whispered to Uncle Job.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"A chart of the Channel," says the sergeant (knowing about such things).
    </p>
    <p>
      'The other French officer now stooped likewise, and over the map they had
      a long consultation, as they pointed here and there on the paper, and then
      hither and thither at places along the shore beneath us. I noticed that
      the manner of one officer was very respectful toward the other, who seemed
      much his superior, the second in rank calling him by a sort of title that
      I did not know the sense of. The head one, on the other hand, was quite
      familiar with his friend, and more than once clapped him on the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Uncle Job had watched as well as I, but though the map had been in the
      lantern-light, their faces had always been in shade. But when they rose
      from stooping over the chart the light flashed upward, and fell smart upon
      one of 'em's features. No sooner had this happened than Uncle Job gasped,
      and sank down as if he'd been in a fit.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"What is it-what is it, Uncle Job?" said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"O good God!" says he, under the straw.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"What?" says I.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Boney!" he groaned out.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Who?" says I.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Bonaparty," he said. "The Corsican ogre. O that I had got but my
      new-flinted firelock, that there man should die! But I haven't got my
      new-flinted firelock, and that there man must live. So lie low, as you
      value your life!"
    </p>
    <p>
      'I did lie low, as you mid suppose. But I couldn't help peeping. And then
      I too, lad as I was, knew that it was the face of Bonaparte. Not know
      Boney? I should think I did know Boney. I should have known him by half
      the light o' that lantern. If I had seen a picture of his features once, I
      had seen it a hundred times. There was his bullet head, his short neck,
      his round yaller cheeks and chin, his gloomy face, and his great glowing
      eyes. He took off his hat to blow himself a bit, and there was the
      forelock in the middle of his forehead, as in all the draughts of him. In
      moving, his cloak fell a little open, and I could see for a moment his
      white-fronted jacket and one of his epaulets.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But none of this lasted long. In a minute he and his general had rolled
      up the map, shut the lantern, and turned to go down toward the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then Uncle Job came to himself a bit. "Slipped across in the night- time
      to see how to put his men ashore," he said. "The like o' that man's
      coolness eyes will never again see! Nephew, I must act in this, and
      immediate, or England's lost!"
    </p>
    <p>
      'When they were over the brow, we crope out, and went some little way to
      look after them. Half-way down they were joined by two others, and six or
      seven minutes brought them to the shore. Then, from behind a rock, a boat
      came out into the weak moonlight of the Cove, and they jumped in; it put
      off instantly, and vanished in a few minutes between the two rocks that
      stand at the mouth of the Cove as we all know. We climmed back to where we
      had been before, and I could see, a little way out, a larger vessel,
      though still not very large. The little boat drew up alongside, was made
      fast at the stern as I suppose, for the largest sailed away, and we saw no
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My uncle Job told his officers as soon as he got back to camp; but what
      they thought of it I never heard-neither did he. Boney's army never came,
      and a good job for me; for the Cove below my father's house was where he
      meant to land, as this secret visit showed. We coast-folk should have been
      cut down one and all, and I should not have sat here to tell this tale.'
    </p>
    <p>
      We who listened to old Selby that night have been familiar with his simple
      grave-stone for these ten years past. Thanks to the incredulity of the age
      his tale has been seldom repeated. But if anything short of the direct
      testimony of his own eyes could persuade an auditor that Bonaparte had
      examined these shores for himself with a view to a practicable
      landing-place, it would have been Solomon Selby's manner of narrating the
      adventure which befell him on the down.

    <h2>
      A FEW CRUSTED CHARACTERS
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is a Saturday afternoon of blue and yellow autumn time, and the scene
      is the High Street of a well-known market-town. A large carrier's van
      stands in the quadrangular fore-court of the White Hart Inn, upon the
      sides of its spacious tilt being painted, in weather-beaten letters:
      'Burthen, Carrier to Longpuddle.' These vans, so numerous hereabout, are a
      respectable, if somewhat lumbering, class of conveyance, much resorted to
      by decent travellers not overstocked with money, the better among them
      roughly corresponding to the old French diligences.
    </p>
    <p>
      The present one is timed to leave the town at four in the afternoon
      precisely, and it is now half-past three by the clock in the turret at the
      top of the street. In a few seconds errand-boys from the shops begin to
      arrive with packages, which they fling into the vehicle, and turn away
      whistling, and care for the packages no more. At twenty minutes to four an
      elderly woman places her basket upon the shafts, slowly mounts, takes up a
      seat inside, and folds her hands and her lips. She has secured her corner
      for the journey, though there is as yet no sign of a horse being put in,
      nor of a carrier. At the three-quarters, two other women arrive, in whom
      the first recognizes the postmistress of Upper Longpuddle and the
      registrar's wife, they recognizing her as the aged groceress of the same
      village. At five minutes to the hour there approach Mr. Profitt, the
      schoolmaster, in a soft felt hat, and Christopher Twink, the
      master-thatcher; and as the hour strikes there rapidly drop in the parish
      clerk and his wife, the seedsman and his aged father, the registrar; also
      Mr. Day, the world-ignored local landscape- painter, an elderly man who
      resides in his native place, and has never sold a picture outside it,
      though his pretensions to art have been nobly supported by his
      fellow-villagers, whose confidence in his genius has been as remarkable as
      the outer neglect of it, leading them to buy his paintings so extensively
      (at the price of a few shillings each, it is true) that every dwelling in
      the parish exhibits three or four of those admired productions on its
      walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burthen, the carrier, is by this time seen bustling round the vehicle; the
      horses are put in, the proprietor arranges the reins and springs up into
      his seat as if he were used to it-which he is.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is everybody here?' he asks preparatorily over his shoulder to the
      passengers within.
    </p>
    <p>
      As those who were not there did not reply in the negative the muster was
      assumed to be complete, and after a few hitches and hindrances the van
      with its human freight was got under way. It jogged on at an easy pace
      till it reached the bridge which formed the last outpost of the town. The
      carrier pulled up suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Bless my soul!' he said, 'I've forgot the curate!'
    </p>
    <p>
      All who could do so gazed from the little back window of the van, but the
      curate was not in sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now I wonder where that there man is?' continued the carrier.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Poor man, he ought to have a living at his time of life.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And he ought to be punctual,' said the carrier. '"Four o'clock sharp is
      my time for starting," I said to 'en. And he said, "I'll be there." Now
      he's not here, and as a serious old church-minister he ought to be as good
      as his word. Perhaps Mr. Flaxton knows, being in the same line of life?'
      He turned to the parish clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I was talking an immense deal with him, that's true, half an hour ago,'
      replied that ecclesiastic, as one of whom it was no erroneous supposition
      that he should be on intimate terms with another of the cloth. 'But he
      didn't say he would be late.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The discussion was cut off by the appearance round the corner of the van
      of rays from the curate's spectacles, followed hastily by his face and a
      few white whiskers, and the swinging tails of his long gaunt coat. Nobody
      reproached him, seeing how he was reproaching himself; and he entered
      breathlessly and took his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now be we all here?' said the carrier again. They started a second time,
      and moved on till they were about three hundred yards out of the town, and
      had nearly reached the second bridge, behind which, as every native
      remembers, the road takes a turn and travellers by this highway disappear
      finally from the view of gazing burghers.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, as I'm alive!' cried the postmistress from the interior of the
      conveyance, peering through the little square back-window along the road
      townward.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What?' said the carrier.
    </p>
    <p>
      'A man hailing us!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Another sudden stoppage. 'Somebody else?' the carrier asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ay, sure!' All waited silently, while those who could gaze out did so.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now, who can that be?' Burthen continued. 'I just put it to ye,
      neighbours, can any man keep time with such hindrances? Bain't we full
      a'ready? Who in the world can the man be?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He's a sort of gentleman,' said the schoolmaster, his position commanding
      the road more comfortably than that of his comrades.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger, who had been holding up his umbrella to attract their
      notice, was walking forward leisurely enough, now that he found, by their
      stopping, that it had been secured. His clothes were decidedly not of a
      local cut, though it was difficult to point out any particular mark of
      difference. In his left hand he carried a small leather travelling bag. As
      soon as he had overtaken the van he glanced at the inscription on its
      side, as if to assure himself that he had hailed the right conveyance, and
      asked if they had room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The carrier replied that though they were pretty well laden he supposed
      they could carry one more, whereupon the stranger mounted, and took the
      seat cleared for him within. And then the horses made another move, this
      time for good, and swung along with their burden of fourteen souls all
      told.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You bain't one of these parts, sir?' said the carrier. 'I could tell that
      as far as I could see 'ee.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, I am one of these parts,' said the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh? H'm.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The silence which followed seemed to imply a doubt of the truth of the
      new-comer's assertion. 'I was speaking of Upper Longpuddle more
      particular,' continued the carrier hardily, 'and I think I know most faces
      of that valley.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I was born at Longpuddle, and nursed at Longpuddle, and my father and
      grandfather before me,' said the passenger quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, to be sure,' said the aged groceress in the background, 'it isn't
      John Lackland's son-never-it can't be-he who went to foreign parts five-
      and-thirty years ago with his wife and family? Yet-what do I hear?-that's
      his father's voice!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's the man,' replied the stranger. 'John Lackland was my father, and
      I am John Lackland's son. Five-and-thirty years ago, when I was a boy of
      eleven, my parents emigrated across the seas, taking me and my sister with
      them. Kytes's boy Tony was the one who drove us and our belongings to
      Casterbridge on the morning we left; and his was the last Longpuddle face
      I saw. We sailed the same week across the ocean, and there we've been ever
      since, and there I've left those I went with-all three.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Alive or dead?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dead,' he replied in a low voice. 'And I have come back to the old place,
      having nourished a thought-not a definite intention, but just a
      thought-that I should like to return here in a year or two, to spend the
      remainder of my days.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Married man, Mr. Lackland?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And have the world used 'ee well, sir-or rather John, knowing 'ee as a
      child? In these rich new countries that we hear of so much, you've got
      rich with the rest?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am not very rich,' Mr. Lackland said. 'Even in new countries, you know,
      there are failures. The race is not always to the swift, nor the battle to
      the strong; and even if it sometimes is, you may be neither swift nor
      strong. However, that's enough about me. Now, having answered your
      inquiries, you must answer mine; for being in London, I have come down
      here entirely to discover what Longpuddle is looking like, and who are
      living there. That was why I preferred a seat in your van to hiring a
      carriage for driving across.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, as for Longpuddle, we rub on there much as usual. Old figures have
      dropped out o' their frames, so to speak it, and new ones have been put in
      their places. You mentioned Tony Kytes as having been the one to drive
      your family and your goods to Casterbridge in his father's waggon when you
      left. Tony is, I believe, living still, but not at Longpuddle. He went
      away and settled at Lewgate, near Mellstock, after his marriage. Ah, Tony
      was a sort o' man!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'His character had hardly come out when I knew him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No. But 'twas well enough, as far as that goes-except as to women. I
      shall never forget his courting-never!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The returned villager waited silently, and the carrier went on:-

    <h2>
      TONY KYTES, THE ARCH-DECEIVER
    </h2>
    <p>
      'I shall never forget Tony's face. 'Twas a little, round, firm, tight
      face, with a seam here and there left by the smallpox, but not enough to
      hurt his looks in a woman's eye, though he'd had it badish when he was a
      boy. So very serious looking and unsmiling 'a was, that young man, that it
      really seemed as if he couldn't laugh at all without great pain to his
      conscience. He looked very hard at a small speck in your eye when talking
      to 'ee. And there was no more sign of a whisker or beard on Tony Kytes's
      face than on the palm of my hand. He used to sing "The Tailor's Breeches"
      with a religious manner, as if it were a hymn:-
    </p>
    <p>
      '"O the petticoats went off, and the breeches they went on!"
    </p>
    <p>
      and all the rest of the scandalous stuff. He was quite the women's
      favourite, and in return for their likings he loved 'em in shoals.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But in course of time Tony got fixed down to one in particular, Milly
      Richards, a nice, light, small, tender little thing; and it was soon said
      that they were engaged to be married. One Saturday he had been to market
      to do business for his father, and was driving home the waggon in the
      afternoon. When he reached the foot of the very hill we shall be going
      over in ten minutes who should he see waiting for him at the top but Unity
      Sallet, a handsome girl, one of the young women he'd been very tender
      toward before he'd got engaged to Milly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'As soon as Tony came up to her she said, "My dear Tony, will you give me
      a lift home?"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"That I will, darling," said Tony. "You don't suppose I could refuse
      'ee?"
    </p>
    <p>
      'She smiled a smile, and up she hopped, and on drove Tony.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Tony," she says, in a sort of tender chide, "why did ye desert me for
      that other one? In what is she better than I? I should have made 'ee a
      finer wife, and a more loving one too. 'Tisn't girls that are so easily
      won at first that are the best. Think how long we've known each other-ever
      since we were children almost-now haven't we, Tony?"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Yes, that we have," says Tony, a-struck with the truth o't.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"And you've never seen anything in me to complain of, have ye, Tony? Now
      tell the truth to me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"I never have, upon my life," says Tony.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"And-can you say I'm not pretty, Tony? Now look at me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      'He let his eyes light upon her for a long while. "I really can't," says
      he. "In fact, I never knowed you was so pretty before!"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Prettier than she?"
    </p>
    <p>
      'What Tony would have said to that nobody knows, for before he could
      speak, what should he see ahead, over the hedge past the turning, but a
      feather he knew well-the feather in Milly's hat-she to whom he had been
      thinking of putting the question as to giving out the banns that very
      week.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Unity," says he, as mild as he could, "here's Milly coming. Now I shall
      catch it mightily if she sees 'ee riding here with me; and if you get down
      she'll be turning the corner in a moment, and, seeing 'ee in the road,
      she'll know we've been coming on together. Now, dearest Unity, will ye, to
      avoid all unpleasantness, which I know ye can't bear any more than I, will
      ye lie down in the back part of the waggon, and let me cover you over with
      the tarpaulin till Milly has passed? It will all be done in a minute.
      Do!-and I'll think over what we've said; and perhaps I shall put a loving
      question to you after all, instead of to Milly. 'Tisn't true that it is
      all settled between her and me."
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, Unity Sallet agreed, and lay down at the back end of the waggon,
      and Tony covered her over, so that the waggon seemed to be empty but for
      the loose tarpaulin; and then he drove on to meet Milly.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"My dear Tony!" cries Milly, looking up with a little pout at him as he
      came near. "How long you've been coming home! Just as if I didn't live at
      Upper Longpuddle at all! And I've come to meet you as you asked me to do,
      and to ride back with you, and talk over our future home-since you asked
      me, and I promised. But I shouldn't have come else, Mr. Tony!"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Ay, my dear, I did ask ye-to be sure I did, now I think of it-but I had
      quite forgot it. To ride back with me, did you say, dear Milly?"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Well, of course! What can I do else? Surely you don't want me to walk,
      now I've come all this way?"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"O no, no! I was thinking you might be going on to town to meet your
      mother. I saw her there-and she looked as if she might be expecting 'ee."
    </p>
    <p>
      '"O no; she's just home. She came across the fields, and so got back
      before you."
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Ah! I didn't know that," says Tony. And there was no help for it but to
      take her up beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'They talked on very pleasantly, and looked at the trees, and beasts, and
      birds, and insects, and at the ploughmen at work in the fields, till
      presently who should they see looking out of the upper window of a house
      that stood beside the road they were following, but Hannah Jolliver,
      another young beauty of the place at that time, and the very first woman
      that Tony had fallen in love with-before Milly and before Unity, in
      fact-the one that he had almost arranged to marry instead of Milly. She
      was a much more dashing girl than Milly Richards, though he'd not thought
      much of her of late. The house Hannah was looking from was her aunt's.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"My dear Milly-my coming wife, as I may call 'ee," says Tony in his
      modest way, and not so loud that Unity could overhear, "I see a young
      woman alooking out of window, who I think may accost me. The fact is,
      Milly, she had a notion that I was wishing to marry her, and since she's
      discovered I've promised another, and a prettier than she, I'm rather
      afeard of her temper if she sees us together. Now, Milly, would you do me
      a favour-my coming wife, as I may say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Certainly, dearest Tony," says she.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Then would ye creep under the empty sacks just here in the front of the
      waggon, and hide there out of sight till we've passed the house? She
      hasn't seen us yet. You see, we ought to live in peace and good- will
      since 'tis almost Christmas, and 'twill prevent angry passions rising,
      which we always should do."
    </p>
    <p>
      '"I don't mind, to oblige you, Tony," Milly said; and though she didn't
      care much about doing it, she crept under, and crouched down just behind
      the seat, Unity being snug at the other end. So they drove on till they
      got near the road-side cottage. Hannah had soon seen him coming, and
      waited at the window, looking down upon him. She tossed her head a little
      disdainful and smiled off-hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Well, aren't you going to be civil enough to ask me to ride home with
      you!" she says, seeing that he was for driving past with a nod and a
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Ah, to be sure! What was I thinking of?" said Tony, in a flutter. "But
      you seem as if you was staying at your aunt's?"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"No, I am not," she said. "Don't you see I have my bonnet and jacket on?
      I have only called to see her on my way home. How can you be so stupid,
      Tony?"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"In that case-ah-of course you must come along wi' me," says Tony,
      feeling a dim sort of sweat rising up inside his clothes. And he reined in
      the horse, and waited till she'd come downstairs, and then helped her up
      beside him. He drove on again, his face as long as a face that was a round
      one by nature well could be.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hannah looked round sideways into his eyes. "This is nice, isn't it,
      Tony?" she says. "I like riding with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      'Tony looked back into her eyes. "And I with you," he said after a while.
      In short, having considered her, he warmed up, and the more he looked at
      her the more he liked her, till he couldn't for the life of him think why
      he had ever said a word about marriage to Milly or Unity while Hannah
      Jolliver was in question. So they sat a little closer and closer, their
      feet upon the foot-board and their shoulders touching, and Tony thought
      over and over again how handsome Hannah was. He spoke tenderer and
      tenderer, and called her "dear Hannah" in a whisper at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"You've settled it with Milly by this time, I suppose," said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"N-no, not exactly."
    </p>
    <p>
      '"What? How low you talk, Tony."
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Yes-I've a kind of hoarseness. I said, not exactly."
    </p>
    <p>
      '"I suppose you mean to?"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Well, as to that-" His eyes rested on her face, and hers on his. He
      wondered how he could have been such a fool as not to follow up Hannah.
      "My sweet Hannah!" he bursts out, taking her hand, not being really able
      to help it, and forgetting Milly and Unity, and all the world besides.
      "Settled it? I don't think I have!"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Hark!" says Hannah.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"What?" says Tony, letting go her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Surely I heard a sort of little screaming squeak under those sacks? Why,
      you've been carrying corn, and there's mice in this waggon, I declare!"
      She began to haul up the tails of her gown.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Oh no; 'tis the axle," said Tony in an assuring way. "It do go like that
      sometimes in dry weather."
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Perhaps it was . . . Well, now, to be quite honest, dear Tony, do you
      like her better than me? Because-because, although I've held off so
      independent, I'll own at last that I do like 'ee, Tony, to tell the truth;
      and I wouldn't say no if you asked me-you know what."
    </p>
    <p>
      'Tony was so won over by this pretty offering mood of a girl who had been
      quite the reverse (Hannah had a backward way with her at times, if you can
      mind) that he just glanced behind, and then whispered very soft, "I
      haven't quite promised her, and I think I can get out of it, and ask you
      that question you speak of."
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Throw over Milly?-all to marry me! How delightful!" broke out Hannah,
      quite loud, clapping her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      'At this there was a real squeak-an angry, spiteful squeak, and afterward
      a long moan, as if something had broke its heart, and a movement of the
      empty sacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Something's there!" said Hannah, starting up.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"It's nothing, really," says Tony in a soothing voice, and praying
      inwardly for a way out of this. "I wouldn't tell 'ee at first, because I
      wouldn't frighten 'ee. But, Hannah, I've really a couple of ferrets in a
      bag under there, for rabbiting, and they quarrel sometimes. I don't wish
      it knowed, as 'twould be called poaching. Oh, they can't get out, bless
      ye-you are quite safe! And-and-what a fine day it is, isn't it, Hannah,
      for this time of year? Be you going to market next Saturday? How is your
      aunt now?" And so on, says Tony, to keep her from talking any more about
      love in Milly's hearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But he found his work cut out for him, and wondering again how he should
      get out of this ticklish business, he looked about for a chance. Nearing
      home he saw his father in a field not far off, holding up his hand as if
      he wished to speak to Tony.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Would you mind taking the reins a moment, Hannah," he said, much
      relieved, "while I go and find out what father wants?"
    </p>
    <p>
      'She consented, and away he hastened into the field, only too glad to get
      breathing time. He found that his father was looking at him with rather a
      stern eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Come, come, Tony," says old Mr. Kytes, as soon as his son was alongside
      him, "this won't do, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      '"What?" says Tony.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Why, if you mean to marry Milly Richards, do it, and there's an end o't.
      But don't go driving about the country with Jolliver's daughter and making
      a scandal. I won't have such things done."
    </p>
    <p>
      '"I only asked her-that is, she asked me, to ride home."
    </p>
    <p>
      '"She? Why, now, if it had been Milly, 'twould have been quite proper; but
      you and Hannah Jolliver going about by yourselves-"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Milly's there too, father."
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Milly? Where?"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Under the corn-sacks! Yes, the truth is, father, I've got rather into a
      nunny-watch, I'm afeard! Unity Sallet is there too-yes, at the other end,
      under the tarpaulin. All three are in that waggon, and what to do with 'em
      I know no more than the dead! The best plan is, as I'm thinking, to speak
      out loud and plain to one of 'em before the rest, and that will settle it;
      not but what 'twill cause 'em to kick up a bit of a miff, for certain. Now
      which would you marry, father, if you was in my place?"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Whichever of 'em did not ask to ride with thee."
    </p>
    <p>
      '"That was Milly, I'm bound to say, as she only mounted by my invitation.
      But Milly-"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then stick to Milly, she's the best . . . But look at that!"
    </p>
    <p>
      'His father pointed toward the waggon. "She can't hold that horse in. You
      shouldn't have left the reins in her hands. Run on and take the horse's
      head, or there'll be some accident to them maids!"
    </p>
    <p>
      'Tony's horse, in fact, in spite of Hannah's tugging at the reins, had
      started on his way at a brisk walking pace, being very anxious to get back
      to the stable, for he had had a long day out. Without another word Tony
      rushed away from his father to overtake the horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now of all things that could have happened to wean him from Milly there
      was nothing so powerful as his father's recommending her. No; it could not
      be Milly, after all. Hannah must be the one, since he could not marry all
      three. This he thought while running after the waggon. But queer things
      were happening inside it.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It was, of course, Milly who had screamed under the sack-bags, being
      obliged to let off her bitter rage and shame in that way at what Tony was
      saying, and never daring to show, for very pride and dread o' being
      laughed at, that she was in hiding. She became more and more restless, and
      in twisting herself about, what did she see but another woman's foot and
      white stocking close to her head. It quite frightened her, not knowing
      that Unity Sallet was in the waggon likewise. But after the fright was
      over she determined to get to the bottom of all this, and she crept and
      crept along the bed of the waggon, under the tarpaulin, like a snake, when
      lo and behold she came face to face with Unity.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Well, if this isn't disgraceful!" says Milly in a raging whisper to
      Unity.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"'Tis," says Unity, "to see you hiding in a young man's waggon like this,
      and no great character belonging to either of ye!"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Mind what you are saying!" replied Milly, getting louder. "I am engaged
      to be married to him, and haven't I a right to be here? What right have
      you, I should like to know? What has he been promising you? A pretty lot
      of nonsense, I expect! But what Tony says to other women is all mere wind,
      and no concern to me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Don't you be too sure!" says Unity. "He's going to have Hannah, and not
      you, nor me either; I could hear that."
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now at these strange voices sounding from under the cloth Hannah was
      thunderstruck a'most into a swound; and it was just at this time that the
      horse moved on. Hannah tugged away wildly, not knowing what she was doing;
      and as the quarrel rose louder and louder Hannah got so horrified that she
      let go the reins altogether. The horse went on at his own pace, and coming
      to the corner where we turn round to drop down the hill to Lower
      Longpuddle he turned too quick, the off wheels went up the bank, the
      waggon rose sideways till it was quite on edge upon the near axles, and
      out rolled the three maidens into the road in a heap.
    </p>
    <p>
      'When Tony came up, frightened and breathless, he was relieved enough to
      see that neither of his darlings was hurt, beyond a few scratches from the
      brambles of the hedge. But he was rather alarmed when he heard how they
      were going on at one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Don't ye quarrel, my dears-don't ye!" says he, taking off his hat out of
      respect to 'em. And then he would have kissed them all round, as fair and
      square as a man could, but they were in too much of a taking to let him,
      and screeched and sobbed till they was quite spent.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Now I'll speak out honest, because I ought to," says Tony, as soon as he
      could get heard. "And this is the truth," says he. "I've asked Hannah to
      be mine, and she is willing, and we are going to put up the banns next-"
    </p>
    <p>
      'Tony had not noticed that Hannah's father was coming up behind, nor had
      he noticed that Hannah's face was beginning to bleed from the scratch of a
      bramble. Hannah had seen her father, and had run to him, crying worse than
      ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"My daughter is not willing, sir!" says Mr. Jolliver hot and strong. "Be
      you willing, Hannah? I ask ye to have spirit enough to refuse him, if yer
      virtue is left to 'ee and you run no risk?"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"She's as sound as a bell for me, that I'll swear!" says Tony, flaring
      up. "And so's the others, come to that, though you may think it an onusual
      thing in me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"I have spirit, and I do refuse him!" says Hannah, partly because her
      father was there, and partly, too, in a tantrum because of the discovery,
      and the scratch on her face. "Little did I think when I was so soft with
      him just now that I was talking to such a false deceiver!"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"What, you won't have me, Hannah?" says Tony, his jaw hanging down like a
      dead man's.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Never-I would sooner marry no-nobody at all!" she gasped out, though
      with her heart in her throat, for she would not have refused Tony if he
      had asked her quietly, and her father had not been there, and her face had
      not been scratched by the bramble. And having said that, away she walked
      upon her father's arm, thinking and hoping he would ask her again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Tony didn't know what to say next. Milly was sobbing her heart out; but
      as his father had strongly recommended her he couldn't feel inclined that
      way. So he turned to Unity.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Well, will you, Unity dear, be mine?" he says.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Take her leavings? Not I!" says Unity. "I'd scorn it!" And away walks
      Unity Sallet likewise, though she looked back when she'd gone some way, to
      see if he was following her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'So there at last were left Milly and Tony by themselves, she crying in
      watery streams, and Tony looking like a tree struck by lightning.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Well, Milly," he says at last, going up to her, "it do seem as if fate
      had ordained that it should be you and I, or nobody. And what must be must
      be, I suppose. Hey, Milly?"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"If you like, Tony. You didn't really mean what you said to them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Not a word of it!" declares Tony, bringing down his fist upon his palm.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And then he kissed her, and put the waggon to rights, and they mounted
      together; and their banns were put up the very next Sunday. I was not able
      to go to their wedding, but it was a rare party they had, by all account.
      Everybody in Longpuddle was there almost; you among the rest, I think, Mr.
      Flaxton?' The speaker turned to the parish clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I was,' said Mr. Flaxton. 'And that party was the cause of a very curious
      change in some other people's affairs; I mean in Steve Hardcome's and his
      cousin James's.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah! the Hardcomes,' said the stranger. 'How familiar that name is to me!
      What of them?'
    </p>
    <p>
      The clerk cleared his throat and began:-

    <h2>
      THE HISTORY OF THE HARDCOMES
    </h2>
    <p>
      'Yes, Tony's was the very best wedding-randy that ever I was at; and I've
      been at a good many, as you may suppose'-turning to the newly- arrived
      one-'having as a church-officer, the privilege to attend all christening,
      wedding, and funeral parties-such being our Wessex custom.
    </p>
    <p>
      ''Twas on a frosty night in Christmas week, and among the folk invited
      were the said Hardcomes o' Climmerston-Steve and James-first cousins, both
      of them small farmers, just entering into business on their own account.
      With them came, as a matter of course, their intended wives, two young
      women of the neighbourhood, both very pretty and sprightly maidens, and
      numbers of friends from Abbot's-Cernel, and Weatherbury, and Mellstock,
      and I don't know where-a regular houseful.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The kitchen was cleared of furniture for dancing, and the old folk played
      at "Put" and "All-fours" in the parlour, though at last they gave that up
      to join in the dance. The top of the figure was by the large front window
      of the room, and there were so many couples that the lower part of the
      figure reached through the door at the back, and into the darkness of the
      out-house; in fact, you couldn't see the end of the row at all, and 'twas
      never known exactly how long that dance was, the lowest couples being lost
      among the faggots and brushwood in the out- house.
    </p>
    <p>
      'When we had danced a few hours, and the crowns of we taller men were
      swelling into lumps with bumping the beams of the ceiling, the first
      fiddler laid down his fiddle-bow, and said he should play no more, for he
      wished to dance. And in another hour the second fiddler laid down his, and
      said he wanted to dance too; so there was only the third fiddler left, and
      he was a' old, veteran man, very weak in the wrist. However, he managed to
      keep up a faltering tweedle-dee; but there being no chair in the room, and
      his knees being as weak as his wrists, he was obliged to sit upon as much
      of the little corner-table as projected beyond the corner-cupboard fixed
      over it, which was not a very wide seat for a man advanced in years.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Among those who danced most continually were the two engaged couples, as
      was natural to their situation. Each pair was very well matched, and very
      unlike the other. James Hardcome's intended was called Emily Darth, and
      both she and James were gentle, nice-minded, in-door people, fond of a
      quiet life. Steve and his chosen, named Olive Pawle, were different; they
      were of a more bustling nature, fond of racketing about and seeing what
      was going on in the world. The two couples had arranged to get married on
      the same day, and that not long thence; Tony's wedding being a sort of
      stimulant, as is often the case; I've noticed it professionally many
      times.
    </p>
    <p>
      'They danced with such a will as only young people in that stage of
      courtship can dance; and it happened that as the evening wore on James had
      for his partner Stephen's plighted one, Olive, at the same time that
      Stephen was dancing with James's Emily. It was noticed that in spite o'
      the exchange the young men seemed to enjoy the dance no less than before.
      By and by they were treading another tune in the same changed order as we
      had noticed earlier, and though at first each one had held the other's
      mistress strictly at half-arm's length, lest there should be shown any
      objection to too close quarters by the lady's proper man, as time passed
      there was a little more closeness between 'em; and presently a little more
      closeness still.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The later it got the more did each of the two cousins dance with the
      wrong young girl, and the tighter did he hold her to his side as he
      whirled her round; and, what was very remarkable, neither seemed to mind
      what the other was doing. The party began to draw towards its end, and I
      saw no more that night, being one of the first to leave, on account of my
      morning's business. But I learnt the rest of it from those that knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      'After finishing a particularly warming dance with the changed partners,
      as I've mentioned, the two young men looked at one another, and in a
      moment or two went out into the porch together.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"James," says Steve, "what were you thinking of when you were dancing
      with my Olive?"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Well," said James, "perhaps what you were thinking of when you were
      dancing with my Emily."
    </p>
    <p>
      '"I was thinking," said Steve, with some hesitation, "that I wouldn't mind
      changing for good and all!"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"It was what I was feeling likewise," said James.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"I willingly agree to it, if you think we could manage it."
    </p>
    <p>
      '"So do I. But what would the girls say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"'Tis my belief," said Steve, "that they wouldn't particularly object.
      Your Emily clung as close to me as if she already belonged to me, dear
      girl."
    </p>
    <p>
      '"And your Olive to me," says James. "I could feel her heart beating like
      a clock."
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, they agreed to put it to the girls when they were all four walking
      home together. And they did so. When they parted that night the exchange
      was decided on-all having been done under the hot excitement of that
      evening's dancing. Thus it happened that on the following Sunday morning,
      when the people were sitting in church with mouths wide open to hear the
      names published as they had expected, there was no small amazement to hear
      them coupled the wrong way, as it seemed. The congregation whispered, and
      thought the parson had made a mistake; till they discovered that his
      reading of the names was verily the true way. As they had decided, so they
      were married, each one to the other's original property.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, the two couples lived on for a year or two ordinarily enough, till
      the time came when these young people began to grow a little less warm to
      their respective spouses, as is the rule of married life; and the two
      cousins wondered more and more in their hearts what had made 'em so mad at
      the last moment to marry crosswise as they did, when they might have
      married straight, as was planned by nature, and as they had fallen in
      love. 'Twas Tony's party that had done it, plain enough, and they half
      wished they had never gone there. James, being a quiet, fireside, perusing
      man, felt at times a wide gap between himself and Olive, his wife, who
      loved riding and driving and out-door jaunts to a degree; while Steve, who
      was always knocking about hither and thither, had a very domestic wife,
      who worked samplers, and made hearthrugs, scarcely ever wished to cross
      the threshold, and only drove out with him to please him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'However, they said very little about this mismating to any of their
      acquaintances, though sometimes Steve would look at James's wife and sigh,
      and James would look at Steve's wife and do the same. Indeed, at last the
      two men were frank enough towards each other not to mind mentioning it
      quietly to themselves, in a long-faced, sorry-smiling, whimsical sort of
      way, and would shake their heads together over their foolishness in
      upsetting a well-considered choice on the strength of an hour's fancy in
      the whirl and wildness of a dance. Still, they were sensible and honest
      young fellows enough, and did their best to make shift with their lot as
      they had arranged it, and not to repine at what could not now be altered
      or mended.
    </p>
    <p>
      'So things remained till one fine summer day they went for their yearly
      little outing together, as they had made it their custom to do for a long
      while past. This year they chose Budmouth-Regis as the place to spend
      their holiday in; and off they went in their best clothes at nine o'clock
      in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      'When they had reached Budmouth-Regis they walked two and two along the
      shore-their new boots going squeakity-squash upon the clammy velvet sands.
      I can seem to see 'em now! Then they looked at the ships in the harbour;
      and then went up to the Look-out; and then had dinner at an inn; and then
      again walked two and two, squeakity-squash, upon the velvet sands. As
      evening drew on they sat on one of the public seats upon the Esplanade,
      and listened to the band; and then they said "What shall we do next?"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Of all things," said Olive (Mrs. James Hardcome, that is), "I should
      like to row in the bay! We could listen to the music from the water as
      well as from here, and have the fun of rowing besides."
    </p>
    <p>
      '"The very thing; so should I," says Stephen, his tastes being always like
      hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the clerk turned to the curate.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But you, sir, know the rest of the strange particulars of that strange
      evening of their lives better than anybody else, having had much of it
      from their own lips, which I had not; and perhaps you'll oblige the
      gentleman?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Certainly, if it is wished,' said the curate. And he took up the clerk's
      tale:-
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      'Stephen's wife hated the sea, except from land, and couldn't bear the
      thought of going into a boat. James, too, disliked the water, and said
      that for his part he would much sooner stay on and listen to the band in
      the seat they occupied, though he did not wish to stand in his wife's way
      if she desired a row. The end of the discussion was that James and his
      cousin's wife Emily agreed to remain where they were sitting and enjoy the
      music, while they watched the other two hire a boat just beneath, and take
      their water-excursion of half an hour or so, till they should choose to
      come back and join the sitters on the Esplanade; when they would all start
      homeward together.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nothing could have pleased the other two restless ones better than this
      arrangement; and Emily and James watched them go down to the boatman below
      and choose one of the little yellow skiffs, and walk carefully out upon
      the little plank that was laid on trestles to enable them to get alongside
      the craft. They saw Stephen hand Olive in, and take his seat facing her;
      when they were settled they waved their hands to the couple watching them,
      and then Stephen took the pair of sculls and pulled off to the tune beat
      by the band, she steering through the other boats skimming about, for the
      sea was as smooth as glass that evening, and pleasure-seekers were rowing
      everywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"How pretty they look moving on, don't they?" said Emily to James (as
      I've been assured). "They both enjoy it equally. In everything their
      likings are the same."
    </p>
    <p>
      '"That's true," said James.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"They would have made a handsome pair if they had married," said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Yes," said he. "'Tis a pity we should have parted 'em"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Don't talk of that, James," said she. "For better or for worse we
      decided to do as we did, and there's an end of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      'They sat on after that without speaking, side by side, and the band
      played as before; the people strolled up and down; and Stephen and Olive
      shrank smaller and smaller as they shot straight out to sea. The two on
      shore used to relate how they saw Stephen stop rowing a moment, and take
      off his coat to get at his work better; but James's wife sat quite still
      in the stern, holding the tiller-ropes by which she steered the boat. When
      they had got very small indeed she turned her head to shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"She is waving her handkerchief to us," said Stephen's wife, who
      thereupon pulled out her own, and waved it as a return signal.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The boat's course had been a little awry while Mrs. James neglected her
      steering to wave her handkerchief to her husband and Mrs. Stephen; but now
      the light skiff went straight onward again, and they could soon see
      nothing more of the two figures it contained than Olive's light mantle and
      Stephen's white shirt sleeves behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The two on the shore talked on. "'Twas very curious-our changing partners
      at Tony Kytes's wedding," Emily declared. "Tony was of a fickle nature by
      all account, and it really seemed as if his character had infected us that
      night. Which of you two was it that first proposed not to marry as we were
      engaged?"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"H'm-I can't remember at this moment," says James. "We talked it over,
      you know; and no sooner said than done."
    </p>
    <p>
      '"'Twas the dancing," said she. "People get quite crazy sometimes in a
      dance."
    </p>
    <p>
      '"They do," he owned.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"James-do you think they care for one another still?" asks Mrs. Stephen.
    </p>
    <p>
      'James Hardcome mused and admitted that perhaps a little tender feeling
      might flicker up in their hearts for a moment now and then. "Still,
      nothing of any account," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"I sometimes think that Olive is in Steve's mind a good deal," murmurs
      Mrs. Stephen; "particularly when she pleases his fancy by riding past our
      window at a gallop on one of the draught-horses . . . I never could do
      anything of that sort; I could never get over my fear of a horse."
    </p>
    <p>
      '"And I am no horseman, though I pretend to be on her account," murmured
      James Hardcome. "But isn't it almost time for them to turn and sweep round
      to the shore, as the other boating folk have done? I wonder what Olive
      means by steering away straight to the horizon like that? She has hardly
      swerved from a direct line seaward since they started."
    </p>
    <p>
      '"No doubt they are talking, and don't think of where they are going,"
      suggests Stephen's wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Perhaps so," said James. "I didn't know Steve could row like that."
    </p>
    <p>
      '"O yes," says she. "He often comes here on business, and generally has a
      pull round the bay."
    </p>
    <p>
      '"I can hardly see the boat or them," says James again; "and it is getting
      dark."
    </p>
    <p>
      'The heedless pair afloat now formed a mere speck in the films of the
      coming night, which thickened apace, till it completely swallowed up their
      distant shapes. They had disappeared while still following the same
      straight course away from the world of land-livers, as if they were
      intending to drop over the sea-edge into space, and never return to earth
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The two on the shore continued to sit on, punctually abiding by their
      agreement to remain on the same spot till the others returned. The
      Esplanade lamps were lit one by one, the bandsmen folded up their stands
      and departed, the yachts in the bay hung out their riding lights, and the
      little boats came back to shore one after another, their hirers walking on
      to the sands by the plank they had climbed to go afloat; but among these
      Stephen and Olive did not appear.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"What a time they are!" said Emily. "I am getting quite chilly. I did not
      expect to have to sit so long in the evening air."
    </p>
    <p>
      'Thereupon James Hardcome said that he did not require his overcoat, and
      insisted on lending it to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He wrapped it round Emily's shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Thank you, James," she said. "How cold Olive must be in that thin
      jacket!"
    </p>
    <p>
      'He said he was thinking so too. "Well, they are sure to be quite close at
      hand by this time, though we can't see 'em. The boats are not all in yet.
      Some of the rowers are fond of paddling along the shore to finish out
      their hour of hiring."
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Shall we walk by the edge of the water," said she, "to see if we can
      discover them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      'He assented, reminding her that they must not lose sight of the seat,
      lest the belated pair should return and miss them, and be vexed that they
      had not kept the appointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      'They walked a sentry beat up and down the sands immediately opposite the
      seat; and still the others did not come. James Hardcome at last went to
      the boatman, thinking that after all his wife and cousin might have come
      in under shadow of the dusk without being perceived, and might have
      forgotten the appointment at the bench.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"All in?" asked James.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"All but one boat," said the lessor. "I can't think where that couple is
      keeping to. They might run foul of something or other in the dark."
    </p>
    <p>
      'Again Stephen's wife and Olive's husband waited, with more and more
      anxiety. But no little yellow boat returned. Was it possible they could
      have landed further down the Esplanade?
    </p>
    <p>
      '"It may have been done to escape paying," said the boat-owner. "But they
      didn't look like people who would do that."
    </p>
    <p>
      'James Hardcome knew that he could found no hope on such a reason as that.
      But now, remembering what had been casually discussed between Steve and
      himself about their wives from time to time, he admitted for the first
      time the possibility that their old tenderness had been revived by their
      face-to-face position more strongly than either had anticipated at
      starting-the excursion having been so obviously undertaken for the
      pleasure of the performance only,-and that they had landed at some steps
      he knew of further down toward the pier, to be longer alone together.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Still he disliked to harbour the thought, and would not mention its
      existence to his companion. He merely said to her, "Let us walk further
      on."
    </p>
    <p>
      'They did so, and lingered between the boat-stage and the pier till
      Stephen Hardcome's wife was uneasy, and was obliged to accept James's
      offered arm. Thus the night advanced. Emily was presently so worn out by
      fatigue that James felt it necessary to conduct her home; there was, too,
      a remote chance that the truants had landed in the harbour on the other
      side of the town, or elsewhere, and hastened home in some unexpected way,
      in the belief that their consorts would not have waited so long.
    </p>
    <p>
      'However, he left a direction in the town that a lookout should be kept,
      though this was arranged privately, the bare possibility of an elopement
      being enough to make him reticent; and, full of misgivings, the two
      remaining ones hastened to catch the last train out of Budmouth-Regis; and
      when they got to Casterbridge drove back to Upper Longpuddle.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Along this very road as we do now,' remarked the parish clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      'To be sure-along this very road,' said the curate. 'However, Stephen and
      Olive were not at their homes; neither had entered the village since
      leaving it in the morning. Emily and James Hardcome went to their
      respective dwellings to snatch a hasty night's rest, and at daylight the
      next morning they drove again to Casterbridge and entered the Budmouth
      train, the line being just opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nothing had been heard of the couple there during this brief absence. In
      the course of a few hours some young men testified to having seen such a
      man and woman rowing in a frail hired craft, the head of the boat kept
      straight to sea; they had sat looking in each other's faces as if they
      were in a dream, with no consciousness of what they were doing, or whither
      they were steering. It was not till late that day that more tidings
      reached James's ears. The boat had been found drifting bottom upward a
      long way from land. In the evening the sea rose somewhat, and a cry spread
      through the town that two bodies were cast ashore in Lullstead Bay,
      several miles to the eastward. They were brought to Budmouth, and
      inspection revealed them to be the missing pair. It was said that they had
      been found tightly locked in each other's arms, his lips upon hers, their
      features still wrapt in the same calm and dream- like repose which had
      been observed in their demeanour as they had glided along.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Neither James nor Emily questioned the original motives of the
      unfortunate man and woman in putting to sea. They were both above
      suspicion as to intention. Whatever their mutual feelings might have led
      them on to, underhand behaviour was foreign to the nature of either.
      Conjecture pictured that they might have fallen into tender reverie while
      gazing each into a pair of eyes that had formerly flashed for him and her
      alone, and, unwilling to avow what their mutual sentiments were, they had
      continued thus, oblivious of time and space, till darkness suddenly
      overtook them far from land. But nothing was truly known. It had been
      their destiny to die thus. The two halves, intended by Nature to make the
      perfect whole, had failed in that result during their lives, though "in
      their death they were not divided." Their bodies were brought home, and
      buried on one day. I remember that, on looking round the churchyard while
      reading the service, I observed nearly all the parish at their funeral.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It was so, sir,' said the clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The remaining two,' continued the curate (whose voice had grown husky
      while relating the lovers' sad fate), 'were a more thoughtful and far-
      seeing, though less romantic, couple than the first. They were now
      mutually bereft of a companion, and found themselves by this accident in a
      position to fulfil their destiny according to Nature's plan and their own
      original and calmly-formed intention. James Hardcome took Emily to wife in
      the course of a year and a half; and the marriage proved in every respect
      a happy one. I solemnized the service, Hardcome having told me, when he
      came to give notice of the proposed wedding, the story of his first wife's
      loss almost word for word as I have told it to you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And are they living in Longpuddle still?' asked the new-comer.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no, sir,' interposed the clerk. 'James has been dead these dozen years,
      and his mis'ess about six or seven. They had no children. William Privett
      used to be their odd man till he died.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah-William Privett! He dead too?-dear me!' said the other. 'All passed
      away!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, sir. William was much older than I. He'd ha' been over eighty if he
      had lived till now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'There was something very strange about William's death-very strange
      indeed!' sighed a melancholy man in the back of the van. It was the
      seedsman's father, who had hitherto kept silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And what might that have been?' asked Mr. Lackland.

    <h2>
      THE SUPERSTITIOUS MAN'S STORY
    </h2>
    <p>
      'William, as you may know, was a curious, silent man; you could feel when
      he came near 'ee; and if he was in the house or anywhere behind your back
      without your seeing him, there seemed to be something clammy in the air,
      as if a cellar door was opened close by your elbow. Well, one Sunday, at a
      time that William was in very good health to all appearance, the bell that
      was ringing for church went very heavy all of a sudden; the sexton, who
      told me o't, said he'd not known the bell go so heavy in his hand for
      years-it was just as if the gudgeons wanted oiling. That was on the
      Sunday, as I say. During the week after, it chanced that William's wife
      was staying up late one night to finish her ironing, she doing the washing
      for Mr. and Mrs. Hardcome. Her husband had finished his supper and gone to
      bed as usual some hour or two before. While she ironed she heard him
      coming down stairs; he stopped to put on his boots at the stair-foot,
      where he always left them, and then came on into the living-room where she
      was ironing, passing through it towards the door, this being the only way
      from the staircase to the outside of the house. No word was said on either
      side, William not being a man given to much speaking, and his wife being
      occupied with her work. He went out and closed the door behind him. As her
      husband had now and then gone out in this way at night before when unwell,
      or unable to sleep for want of a pipe, she took no particular notice, and
      continued at her ironing. This she finished shortly after, and as he had
      not come in she waited awhile for him, putting away the irons and things,
      and preparing the table for his breakfast in the morning. Still he did not
      return, but supposing him not far off, and wanting to get to bed herself,
      tired as she was, she left the door unbarred and went to the stairs, after
      writing on the back of the door with chalk: Mind and do the door (because
      he was a forgetful man).
    </p>
    <p>
      'To her great surprise, and I might say alarm, on reaching the foot of the
      stairs his boots were standing there as they always stood when he had gone
      to rest; going up to their chamber she found him in bed sleeping as sound
      as a rock. How he could have got back again without her seeing or hearing
      him was beyond her comprehension. It could only have been by passing
      behind her very quietly while she was bumping with the iron. But this
      notion did not satisfy her: it was surely impossible that she should not
      have seen him come in through a room so small. She could not unravel the
      mystery, and felt very queer and uncomfortable about it. However, she
      would not disturb him to question him then, and went to bed herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He rose and left for his work very early the next morning, before she was
      awake, and she waited his return to breakfast with much anxiety for an
      explanation, for thinking over the matter by daylight made it seem only
      the more startling. When he came in to the meal he said, before she could
      put her question, "What's the meaning of them words chalked on the door?"
    </p>
    <p>
      'She told him, and asked him about his going out the night before. William
      declared that he had never left the bedroom after entering it, having in
      fact undressed, lain down, and fallen asleep directly, never once waking
      till the clock struck five, and he rose up to go to his labour.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Betty Privett was as certain in her own mind that he did go out as she
      was of her own existence, and was little less certain that he did not
      return. She felt too disturbed to argue with him, and let the subject drop
      as though she must have been mistaken. When she was walking down
      Longpuddle street later in the day she met Jim Weedle's daughter Nancy,
      and said, "Well, Nancy, you do look sleepy to-day!"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Yes, Mrs. Privett," says Nancy. "Now don't tell anybody, but I don't
      mind letting you know what the reason o't is. Last night, being Old
      Midsummer Eve, some of us went to church porch, and didn't get home till
      near one."
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Did ye?" says Mrs. Privett. "Old Midsummer yesterday was it? Faith I
      didn't think whe'r 'twas Midsummer or Michaelmas; I'd too much work to
      do."
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Yes. And we were frightened enough, I can tell 'ee, by what we saw."
    </p>
    <p>
      '"What did ye see?"
    </p>
    <p>
      '(You may not remember, sir, having gone off to foreign parts so young,
      that on Midsummer Night it is believed hereabout that the faint shapes of
      all the folk in the parish who are going to be at death's door within the
      year can be seen entering the church. Those who get over their illness
      come out again after a while; those that are doomed to die do not return.)
    </p>
    <p>
      '"What did you see?" asked William's wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Well," says Nancy, backwardly-"we needn't tell what we saw, or who we
      saw."
    </p>
    <p>
      '"You saw my husband," says Betty Privett, in a quiet way.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Well, since you put it so," says Nancy, hanging fire, "we-thought we did
      see him; but it was darkish, and we was frightened, and of course it might
      not have been he."
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Nancy, you needn't mind letting it out, though 'tis kept back in
      kindness. And he didn't come out of church again: I know it as well as
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nancy did not answer yes or no to that, and no more was said. But three
      days after, William Privett was mowing with John Chiles in Mr. Hardcome's
      meadow, and in the heat of the day they sat down to eat their bit o' nunch
      under a tree, and empty their flagon. Afterwards both of 'em fell asleep
      as they sat. John Chiles was the first to wake, and as he looked towards
      his fellow-mower he saw one of those great white miller's-souls as we call
      'em-that is to say, a miller-moth-come from William's open mouth while he
      slept, and fly straight away. John thought it odd enough, as William had
      worked in a mill for several years when he was a boy. He then looked at
      the sun, and found by the place o't that they had slept a long while, and
      as William did not wake, John called to him and said it was high time to
      begin work again. He took no notice, and then John went up and shook him,
      and found he was dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now on that very day old Philip Hookhorn was down at Longpuddle Spring
      dipping up a pitcher of water; and as he turned away, who should he see
      coming down to the spring on the other side but William, looking very pale
      and odd. This surprised Philip Hookhorn very much, for years before that
      time William's little son-his only child-had been drowned in that spring
      while at play there, and this had so preyed upon William's mind that he'd
      never been seen near the spring afterwards, and had been known to go half
      a mile out of his way to avoid the place. On inquiry, it was found that
      William in body could not have stood by the spring, being in the mead two
      miles off; and it also came out that the time at which he was seen at the
      spring was the very time when he died.'
    </p>

    <p>
      'A rather melancholy story,' observed the emigrant, after a minute's
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, yes. Well, we must take ups and downs together,' said the seedsman's
      father.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You don't know, Mr. Lackland, I suppose, what a rum start that was
      between Andrey Satchel and Jane Vallens and the pa'son and clerk o'
      Scrimpton?' said the master-thatcher, a man with a spark of subdued
      liveliness in his eye, who had hitherto kept his attention mainly upon
      small objects a long way ahead, as he sat in front of the van with his
      feet outside. 'Theirs was a queerer experience of a pa'son and clerk than
      some folks get, and may cheer 'ee up a little after this dampness that's
      been flung over yer soul.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The returned one replied that he knew nothing of the history, and should
      be happy to hear it, quite recollecting the personality of the man
      Satchel.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah no; this Andrey Satchel is the son of the Satchel that you knew; this
      one has not been married more than two or three years, and 'twas at the
      time o' the wedding that the accident happened that I could tell 'ee of,
      or anybody else here, for that matter.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, no; you must tell it, neighbour, if anybody,' said several; a request
      in which Mr. Lackland joined, adding that the Satchel family was one he
      had known well before leaving home.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll just mention, as you be a stranger,' whispered the carrier to
      Lackland, 'that Christopher's stories will bear pruning.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The emigrant nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I can soon tell it,' said the master-thatcher, schooling himself to
      a tone of actuality. 'Though as it has more to do with the pa'son and
      clerk than with Andrey himself, it ought to be told by a better churchman
      than I.'

    <h2>
      ANDREY SATCHEL AND THE PARSON AND CLERK
    </h2>
    <p>
      'It all arose, you must know, from Andrey being fond of a drop of drink at
      that time-though he's a sober enough man now by all account, so much the
      better for him. Jane, his bride, you see, was somewhat older than Andrey;
      how much older I don't pretend to say; she was not one of our parish, and
      the register alone may be able to tell that. But, at any rate, her being a
      little ahead of her young man in mortal years, coupled with other bodily
      circumstances-'
    </p>
    <p>
      ('Ah, poor thing!' sighed the women.)
    </p>
    <p>
      '-made her very anxious to get the thing done before he changed his mind;
      and 'twas with a joyful countenance (they say) that she, with Andrey and
      his brother and sister-in-law, marched off to church one November morning
      as soon as 'twas day a'most, to be made one with Andrey for the rest of
      her life. He had left our place long before it was light, and the folks
      that were up all waved their lanterns at him, and flung up their hats as
      he went.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The church of her parish was a mile and more from the houses, and, as it
      was a wonderful fine day for the time of year, the plan was that as soon
      as they were married they would make out a holiday by driving straight off
      to Port Bredy, to see the ships and the sea and the sojers, instead of
      coming back to a meal at the house of the distant relation she lived wi',
      and moping about there all the afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, some folks noticed that Andrey walked with rather wambling steps to
      church that morning; the truth o't was that his nearest neighbour's child
      had been christened the day before, and Andrey, having stood godfather,
      had stayed all night keeping up the christening, for he had said to
      himself, "Not if I live to be thousand shall I again be made a godfather
      one day, and a husband the next, and perhaps a father the next, and
      therefore I'll make the most of the blessing." So that when he started
      from home in the morning he had not been in bed at all. The result was, as
      I say, that when he and his bride-to-he walked up the church to get
      married, the pa'son (who was a very strict man inside the church, whatever
      he was outside) looked hard at Andrey, and said, very sharp:
    </p>
    <p>
      '"How's this, my man? You are in liquor. And so early, too. I'm ashamed of
      you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Well, that's true, sir," says Andrey. "But I can walk straight enough
      for practical purposes. I can walk a chalk line," he says (meaning no
      offence), "as well as some other folk: and-" (getting hotter)-"I reckon
      that if you, Pa'son Billy Toogood, had kept up a christening all night so
      thoroughly as I have done, you wouldn't be able to stand at all; d&mdash;-
      me if you would!"
    </p>
    <p>
      'This answer made Pa'son Billy-as they used to call him-rather spitish,
      not to say hot, for he was a warm-tempered man if provoked, and he said,
      very decidedly: "Well, I cannot marry you in this state; and I will not!
      Go home and get sober!" And he slapped the book together like a rat- trap.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then the bride burst out crying as if her heart would break, for very
      fear that she would lose Andrey after all her hard work to get him, and
      begged and implored the pa'son to go on with the ceremony. But no.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"I won't be a party to your solemnizing matrimony with a tipsy man," says
      Mr. Toogood. "It is not right and decent. I am sorry for you, my young
      woman, but you'd better go home again. I wonder how you could think of
      bringing him here drunk like this!"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"But if-if he don't come drunk he won't come at all, sir!" she says,
      through her sobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"I can't help that," says the pa'son; and plead as she might, it did not
      move him. Then she tried him another way.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Well, then, if you'll go home, sir, and leave us here, and come back to
      the church in an hour or two, I'll undertake to say that he shall be as
      sober as a judge," she cries. "We'll bide here, with your permission; for
      if he once goes out of this here church unmarried, all Van Amburgh's
      horses won't drag him back again!"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Very well," says the parson. "I'll give you two hours, and then I'll
      return."
    </p>
    <p>
      '"And please, sir, lock the door, so that we can't escape!" says she.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Yes," says the parson.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"And let nobody know that we are here."
    </p>
    <p>
      'The pa'son then took off his clane white surplice, and went away; and the
      others consulted upon the best means for keeping the matter a secret,
      which it was not a very hard thing to do, the place being so lonely, and
      the hour so early. The witnesses, Andrey's brother and brother's wife,
      neither one o' which cared about Andrey's marrying Jane, and had come
      rather against their will, said they couldn't wait two hours in that hole
      of a place, wishing to get home to Longpuddle before dinner-time. They
      were altogether so crusty that the clerk said there was no difficulty in
      their doing as they wished. They could go home as if their brother's
      wedding had actually taken place and the married couple had gone onward
      for their day's pleasure jaunt to Port Bredy as intended, he, the clerk,
      and any casual passer-by would act as witnesses when the pa'son came back.
    </p>
    <p>
      'This was agreed to, and away Andrey's relations went, nothing loath, and
      the clerk shut the church door and prepared to lock in the couple. The
      bride went up and whispered to him, with her eyes a-streaming still.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"My dear good clerk," she says, "if we bide here in the church, folk may
      see us through the winders, and find out what has happened; and 'twould
      cause such a talk and scandal that I never should get over it: and
      perhaps, too, dear Andrey might try to get out and leave me! Will ye lock
      us up in the tower, my dear good clerk?" she says. "I'll tole him in there
      if you will."
    </p>
    <p>
      'The clerk had no objection to do this to oblige the poor young woman, and
      they toled Andrey into the tower, and the clerk locked 'em both up
      straightway, and then went home, to return at the end of the two hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Pa'son Toogood had not been long in his house after leaving the church
      when he saw a gentleman in pink and top-boots ride past his windows, and
      with a sudden flash of heat he called to mind that the hounds met that day
      just on the edge of his parish. The pa'son was one who dearly loved sport,
      and much he longed to be there.
    </p>
    <p>
      'In short, except o' Sundays and at tide-times in the week, Pa'son Billy
      was the life o' the Hunt. 'Tis true that he was poor, and that he rode all
      of a heap, and that his black mare was rat-tailed and old, and his tops
      older, and all over of one colour, whitey-brown, and full o' cracks. But
      he'd been in at the death of three thousand foxes. And-being a bachelor
      man-every time he went to bed in summer he used to open the bed at bottom
      and crawl up head foremost, to mind 'em of the coming winter and the good
      sport he'd have, and the foxes going to earth. And whenever there was a
      christening at the Squire's, and he had dinner there afterwards, as he
      always did, he never failed to christen the chiel over again in a bottle
      of port wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now the clerk was the parson's groom and gardener and jineral manager,
      and had just got back to his work in the garden when he, too, saw the
      hunting man pass, and presently saw lots more of 'em, noblemen and gentry,
      and then he saw the hounds, the huntsman, Jim Treadhedge, the whipper-in,
      and I don't know who besides. The clerk loved going to cover as frantical
      as the pa'son, so much so that whenever he saw or heard the pack he could
      no more rule his feelings than if they were the winds of heaven. He might
      be bedding, or he might be sowing-all was forgot. So he throws down his
      spade and rushes in to the pa'son, who was by this time as frantical to go
      as he.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"That there mare of yours, sir, do want exercise bad, very bad, this
      morning!" the clerk says, all of a tremble. "Don't ye think I'd better
      trot her round the downs for an hour, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"To be sure, she does want exercise badly. I'll trot her round myself,"
      says the parson.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Oh-you'll trot her yerself? Well, there's the cob, sir. Really that cob
      is getting oncontrollable through biding in a stable so long! If you
      wouldn't mind my putting on the saddle-"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Very well. Take him out, certainly," says the pa'son, never caring what
      the clerk did so long as he himself could get off immediately. So,
      scrambling into his riding-boots and breeches as quick as he could, he
      rode off towards the meet, intending to be back in an hour. No sooner was
      he gone than the clerk mounted the cob, and was off after him. When the
      pa'son got to the meet, he found a lot of friends, and was as jolly as he
      could be: the hounds found a'most as soon as they threw off, and there was
      great excitement. So, forgetting that he had meant to go back at once,
      away rides the pa'son with the rest o' the hunt, all across the fallow
      ground that lies between Lippet Wood and Green's Copse; and as he galloped
      he looked behind for a moment, and there was the clerk close to his heels.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Ha, ha, clerk-you here?" he says.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Yes, sir, here be I," says t'other.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Fine exercise for the horses!"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Ay, sir-hee, hee!" says the clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      'So they went on and on, into Green's Copse, then across to Higher Jirton;
      then on across this very turnpike-road to Climmerston Ridge, then away
      towards Yalbury Wood: up hill and down dale, like the very wind, the clerk
      close to the pa'son, and the pa'son not far from the hounds. Never was
      there a finer run knowed with that pack than they had that day; and
      neither pa'son nor clerk thought one word about the unmarried couple
      locked up in the church tower waiting to get j'ined.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"These hosses of yours, sir, will be much improved by this!" says the
      clerk as he rode along, just a neck behind the pa'son. "'Twas a happy
      thought of your reverent mind to bring 'em out to-day. Why, it may be
      frosty in a day or two, and then the poor things mid not be able to leave
      the stable for weeks."
    </p>
    <p>
      '"They may not, they may not, it is true. A merciful man is merciful to
      his beast," says the pa'son.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Hee, hee!" says the clerk, glancing sly into the pa'son's eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Ha, ha!" says the pa'son, a-glancing back into the clerk's. "Halloo!" he
      shouts, as he sees the fox break cover at that moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Halloo!" cries the clerk. "There he goes! Why, dammy, there's two
      foxes-"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Hush, clerk, hush! Don't let me hear that word again! Remember our
      calling."
    </p>
    <p>
      '"True, sir, true. But really, good sport do carry away a man so, that
      he's apt to forget his high persuasion!" And the next minute the corner of
      the clerk's eye shot again into the corner of the pa'son's, and the
      pa'son's back again to the clerk's. "Hee, hee!" said the clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Ha, ha!" said Pa'son Toogood.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Ah, sir," says the clerk again, "this is better than crying Amen to your
      Ever-and-ever on a winter's morning!"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Yes, indeed, clerk! To everything there's a season," says Pa'son
      Toogood, quite pat, for he was a learned Christian man when he liked, and
      had chapter and ve'se at his tongue's end, as a pa'son should.
    </p>
    <p>
      'At last, late in the day, the hunting came to an end by the fox running
      into a' old woman's cottage, under her table, and up the clock-case. The
      pa'son and clerk were among the first in at the death, their faces
      a-staring in at the old woman's winder, and the clock striking as he'd
      never been heard to strik' before. Then came the question of finding their
      way home.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Neither the pa'son nor the clerk knowed how they were going to do this,
      for their beasts were wellnigh tired down to the ground. But they started
      back-along as well as they could, though they were so done up that they
      could only drag along at a' amble, and not much of that at a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"We shall never, never get there!" groaned Mr. Toogood, quite bowed down.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Never!" groans the clerk. "'Tis a judgment upon us for our iniquities!"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"I fear it is," murmurs the pa'son.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, 'twas quite dark afore they entered the pa'sonage gate, having
      crept into the parish as quiet as if they'd stole a hammer, little wishing
      their congregation to know what they'd been up to all day long. And as
      they were so dog-tired, and so anxious about the horses, never once did
      they think of the unmarried couple. As soon as ever the horses had been
      stabled and fed, and the pa'son and clerk had had a bit and a sup
      theirselves, they went to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Next morning when Pa'son Toogood was at breakfast, thinking of the
      glorious sport he'd had the day before, the clerk came in a hurry to the
      door and asked to see him.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"It has just come into my mind, sir, that we've forgot all about the
      couple that we was to have married yesterday!"
    </p>
    <p>
      'The half-chawed victuals dropped from the pa'son's mouth as if he'd been
      shot. "Bless my soul," says he, "so we have! How very awkward!"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"It is, sir; very. Perhaps we've ruined the 'ooman!"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Ah-to be sure-I remember! She ought to have been married before."
    </p>
    <p>
      '"If anything has happened to her up in that there tower, and no doctor or
      nuss-"
    </p>
    <p>
      ('Ah-poor thing!' sighed the women.)
    </p>
    <p>
      '"-'twill be a quarter-sessions matter for us, not to speak of the
      disgrace to the Church!"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Good God, clerk, don't drive me wild!" says the pa'son. "Why the hell
      didn't I marry 'em, drunk or sober!" (Pa'sons used to cuss in them days
      like plain honest men.) "Have you been to the church to see what happened
      to them, or inquired in the village?"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Not I, sir! It only came into my head a moment ago, and I always like to
      be second to you in church matters. You could have knocked me down with a
      sparrer's feather when I thought o't, sir; I assure 'ee you could!"
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, the parson jumped up from his breakfast, and together they went off
      to the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"It is not at all likely that they are there now," says Mr. Toogood, as
      they went; "and indeed I hope they are not. They be pretty sure to have
      'scaped and gone home."
    </p>
    <p>
      'However, they opened the church-hatch, entered the churchyard, and
      looking up at the tower, there they seed a little small white face at the
      belfry-winder, and a little small hand waving. 'Twas the bride.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"God my life, clerk," says Mr. Toogood, "I don't know how to face 'em!"
      And he sank down upon a tombstone. "How I wish I hadn't been so cussed
      particular!"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Yes-'twas a pity we didn't finish it when we'd begun," the clerk said.
      "Still, since the feelings of your holy priestcraft wouldn't let ye, the
      couple must put up with it."
    </p>
    <p>
      '"True, clerk, true! Does she look as if anything premature had took
      place?"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"I can't see her no lower down than her arm-pits, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Well-how do her face look?"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"It do look mighty white!"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Well, we must know the worst! Dear me, how the small of my back do ache
      from that ride yesterday! . . . But to more godly business!"
    </p>
    <p>
      'They went on into the church, and unlocked the tower stairs, and
      immediately poor Jane and Andrey busted out like starved mice from a
      cupboard, Andrey limp and sober enough now, and his bride pale and cold,
      but otherwise as usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"What," says the pa'son, with a great breath of relief, "you haven't been
      here ever since?"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Yes, we have, sir!" says the bride, sinking down upon a seat in her
      weakness. "Not a morsel, wet or dry, have we had since! It was impossible
      to get out without help, and here we've stayed!"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"But why didn't you shout, good souls?" said the pa'son.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"She wouldn't let me," says Andrey.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Because we were so ashamed at what had led to it," sobs Jane. "We felt
      that if it were noised abroad it would cling to us all our lives! Once or
      twice Andrey had a good mind to toll the bell, but then he said: "No; I'll
      starve first. I won't bring disgrace on my name and yours, my dear." And
      so we waited and waited, and walked round and round; but never did you
      come till now!"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"To my regret!" says the parson. "Now, then, we will soon get it over."
    </p>
    <p>
      '"I-I should like some victuals," said Andrey, "'twould gie me courage if
      it is only a crust o' bread and a' onion; for I am that leery that I can
      feel my stomach rubbing against my backbone."
    </p>
    <p>
      '"I think we had better get it done," said the bride, a bit anxious in
      manner; "since we are all here convenient, too!"
    </p>
    <p>
      'Andrey gave way about the victuals, and the clerk called in a second
      witness who wouldn't be likely to gossip about it, and soon the knot was
      tied, and the bride looked smiling and calm forthwith, and Andrey limper
      than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Now," said Pa'son Toogood, "you two must come to my house, and have a
      good lining put to your insides before you go a step further."
    </p>
    <p>
      'They were very glad of the offer, and went out of the churchyard by one
      path while the pa'son and clerk went out by the other, and so did not
      attract notice, it being still early. They entered the rectory as if
      they'd just come back from their trip to Port Bredy; and then they knocked
      in the victuals and drink till they could hold no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It was a long while before the story of what they had gone through was
      known, but it was talked of in time, and they themselves laugh over it
      now; though what Jane got for her pains was no great bargain after all.
      'Tis true she saved her name.'
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      'Was that the same Andrey who went to the squire's house as one of the
      Christmas fiddlers?' asked the seedsman.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, no,' replied Mr. Profitt, the schoolmaster. 'It was his father did
      that. Ay, it was all owing to his being such a man for eating and
      drinking.' Finding that he had the ear of the audience, the schoolmaster
      continued without delay:-

    <h2>
      OLD ANDREY'S EXPERIENCE AS A MUSICIAN
    </h2>
    <p>
      'I was one of the choir-boys at that time, and we and the players were to
      appear at the manor-house as usual that Christmas week, to play and sing
      in the hall to the squire's people and visitors (among 'em being the
      archdeacon, Lord and Lady Baxby, and I don't know who); afterwards going,
      as we always did, to have a good supper in the servants' hall. Andrew knew
      this was the custom, and meeting us when we were starting to go, he said
      to us: "Lord, how I should like to join in that meal of beef, and turkey,
      and plum-pudding, and ale, that you happy ones be going to just now! One
      more or less will make no difference to the squire. I am too old to pass
      as a singing boy, and too bearded to pass as a singing girl; can ye lend
      me a fiddle, neighbours, that I may come with ye as a bandsman?"
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, we didn't like to be hard upon him, and lent him an old one, though
      Andrew knew no more of music than the Cerne Giant; and armed with the
      instrument he walked up to the squire's house with the others of us at the
      time appointed, and went in boldly, his fiddle under his arm. He made
      himself as natural as he could in opening the music-books and moving the
      candles to the best points for throwing light upon the notes; and all went
      well till we had played and sung "While shepherds watch," and "Star,
      arise," and "Hark the glad sound." Then the squire's mother, a tall gruff
      old lady, who was much interested in church-music, said quite unexpectedly
      to Andrew: "My man, I see you don't play your instrument with the rest.
      How is that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      'Every one of the choir was ready to sink into the earth with concern at
      the fix Andrew was in. We could see that he had fallen into a cold sweat,
      and how he would get out of it we did not know.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"I've had a misfortune, mem," he says, bowing as meek as a child. "Coming
      along the road I fell down and broke my bow."
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Oh, I am sorry to hear that," says she. "Can't it be mended?"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Oh no, mem," says Andrew. "'Twas broke all to splinters."
    </p>
    <p>
      '"I'll see what I can do for you," says she.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And then it seemed all over, and we played "Rejoice, ye drowsy mortals
      all," in D and two sharps. But no sooner had we got through it than she
      says to Andrew,
    </p>
    <p>
      '"I've sent up into the attic, where we have some old musical instruments,
      and found a bow for you." And she hands the bow to poor wretched Andrew,
      who didn't even know which end to take hold of. "Now we shall have the
      full accompaniment," says she.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Andrew's face looked as if it were made of rotten apple as he stood in
      the circle of players in front of his book; for if there was one person in
      the parish that everybody was afraid of, 'twas this hook-nosed old lady.
      However, by keeping a little behind the next man he managed to make
      pretence of beginning, sawing away with his bow without letting it touch
      the strings, so that it looked as if he were driving into the tune with
      heart and soul. 'Tis a question if he wouldn't have got through all right
      if one of the squire's visitors (no other than the archdeacon) hadn't
      noticed that he held the fiddle upside down, the nut under his chin, and
      the tail-piece in his hand; and they began to crowd round him, thinking
      'twas some new way of performing.
    </p>
    <p>
      'This revealed everything; the squire's mother had Andrew turned out of
      the house as a vile impostor, and there was great interruption to the
      harmony of the proceedings, the squire declaring he should have notice to
      leave his cottage that day fortnight. However, when we got to the
      servants' hall there sat Andrew, who had been let in at the back door by
      the orders of the squire's wife, after being turned out at the front by
      the orders of the squire, and nothing more was heard about his leaving his
      cottage. But Andrew never performed in public as a musician after that
      night; and now he's dead and gone, poor man, as we all shall be!'
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      'I had quite forgotten the old choir, with their fiddles and bass- viols,'
      said the home-comer, musingly. 'Are they still going on the same as of
      old?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Bless the man!' said Christopher Twink, the master-thatcher; 'why,
      they've been done away with these twenty year. A young teetotaler plays
      the organ in church now, and plays it very well; though 'tis not quite
      such good music as in old times, because the organ is one of them that go
      with a winch, and the young teetotaler says he can't always throw the
      proper feeling into the tune without wellnigh working his arms off.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why did they make the change, then?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, partly because of fashion, partly because the old musicians got
      into a sort of scrape. A terrible scrape 'twas too-wasn't it, John? I
      shall never forget it-never! They lost their character as officers of the
      church as complete as if they'd never had any character at all.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That was very bad for them.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes.' The master-thatcher attentively regarded past times as if they lay
      about a mile off, and went on:-

    <h2>
      ABSENT-MINDEDNESS IN A PARISH CHOIR
    </h2>
    <p>
      'It happened on Sunday after Christmas-the last Sunday ever they played in
      Longpuddle church gallery, as it turned out, though they didn't know it
      then. As you may know, sir, the players formed a very good band-almost as
      good as the Mellstock parish players that were led by the Dewys; and
      that's saying a great deal. There was Nicholas Puddingcome, the leader,
      with the first fiddle; there was Timothy Thomas, the bass- viol man; John
      Biles, the tenor fiddler; Dan'l Hornhead, with the serpent; Robert Dowdle,
      with the clarionet; and Mr. Nicks, with the oboe-all sound and powerful
      musicians, and strong-winded men-they that blowed. For that reason they
      were very much in demand Christmas week for little reels and dancing
      parties; for they could turn a jig or a hornpipe out of hand as well as
      ever they could turn out a psalm, and perhaps better, not to speak
      irreverent. In short, one half-hour they could be playing a Christmas
      carol in the squire's hall to the ladies and gentlemen, and drinking tea
      and coffee with 'em as modest as saints; and the next, at The Tinker's
      Arms, blazing away like wild horses with the "Dashing White Sergeant" to
      nine couple of dancers and more, and swallowing rum-and-cider hot as
      flame.

      'Well, this Christmas they'd been out to one rattling randy after another
      every night, and had got next to no sleep at all. Then came the Sunday
      after Christmas, their fatal day. 'Twas so mortal cold that year that they
      could hardly sit in the gallery; for though the congregation down in the
      body of the church had a stove to keep off the frost, the players in the
      gallery had nothing at all. So Nicholas said at morning service, when
      'twas freezing an inch an hour, "Please the Lord I won't stand this
      numbing weather no longer: this afternoon we'll have something in our
      insides to make us warm, if it cost a king's ransom."
    </p>
    <p>
      'So he brought a gallon of hot brandy and beer, ready mixed, to church
      with him in the afternoon, and by keeping the jar well wrapped up in
      Timothy Thomas's bass-viol bag it kept drinkably warm till they wanted it,
      which was just a thimbleful in the Absolution, and another after the
      Creed, and the remainder at the beginning o' the sermon. When they'd had
      the last pull they felt quite comfortable and warm, and as the sermon went
      on-most unfortunately for 'em it was a long one that afternoon-they fell
      asleep, every man jack of 'em; and there they slept on as sound as rocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      ''Twas a very dark afternoon, and by the end of the sermon all you could
      see of the inside of the church were the pa'son's two candles alongside of
      him in the pulpit, and his spaking face behind 'em. The sermon being ended
      at last, the pa'son gie'd out the Evening Hymn. But no choir set about
      sounding up the tune, and the people began to turn their heads to learn
      the reason why, and then Levi Limpet, a boy who sat in the gallery, nudged
      Timothy and Nicholas, and said, "Begin! begin!"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Hey? what?" says Nicholas, starting up; and the church being so dark and
      his head so muddled he thought he was at the party they had played at all
      the night before, and away he went, bow and fiddle, at "The Devil among
      the Tailors," the favourite jig of our neighbourhood at that time. The
      rest of the band, being in the same state of mind and nothing doubting,
      followed their leader with all their strength, according to custom. They
      poured out that there tune till the lower bass notes of "The Devil among
      the Tailors" made the cobwebs in the roof shiver like ghosts; then
      Nicholas, seeing nobody moved, shouted out as he scraped (in his usual
      commanding way at dances when the folk didn't know the figures), "Top
      couples cross hands! And when I make the fiddle squeak at the end, every
      man kiss his pardner under the mistletoe!"
    </p>
    <p>
      'The boy Levi was so frightened that he bolted down the gallery stairs and
      out homeward like lightning. The pa'son's hair fairly stood on end when he
      heard the evil tune raging through the church, and thinking the choir had
      gone crazy he held up his hand and said: "Stop, stop, stop! Stop, stop!
      What's this?" But they didn't hear'n for the noise of their own playing,
      and the more he called the louder they played.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then the folks came out of their pews, wondering down to the ground, and
      saying: "What do they mean by such wickedness! We shall be consumed like
      Sodom and Gomorrah!"
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then the squire came out of his pew lined wi' green baize, where lots of
      lords and ladies visiting at the house were worshipping along with him,
      and went and stood in front of the gallery, and shook his fist in the
      musicians' faces, saying, "What! In this reverent edifice! What!"
    </p>
    <p>
      'And at last they heard'n through their playing, and stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Never such an insulting, disgraceful thing-never!" says the squire, who
      couldn't rule his passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Never!" says the pa'son, who had come down and stood beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Not if the Angels of Heaven," says the squire (he was a wickedish man,
      the squire was, though now for once he happened to be on the Lord's
      side)-"not if the Angels of Heaven come down," he says, "shall one of you
      villanous players ever sound a note in this church again; for the insult
      to me, and my family, and my visitors, and God Almighty, that you've
      a-perpetrated this afternoon!"
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then the unfortunate church band came to their senses, and remembered
      where they were; and 'twas a sight to see Nicholas Pudding come and
      Timothy Thomas and John Biles creep down the gallery stairs with their
      fiddles under their arms, and poor Dan'l Hornhead with his serpent, and
      Robert Dowdle with his clarionet, all looking as little as ninepins; and
      out they went. The pa'son might have forgi'ed 'em when he learned the
      truth o't, but the squire would not. That very week he sent for a
      barrel-organ that would play two-and-twenty new psalm-tunes, so exact and
      particular that, however sinful inclined you was, you could play nothing
      but psalm-tunes whatsomever. He had a really respectable man to turn the
      winch, as I said, and the old players played no more.'
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      'And, of course, my old acquaintance, the annuitant, Mrs. Winter, who
      always seemed to have something on her mind, is dead and gone?' said the
      home-comer, after a long silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody in the van seemed to recollect the name.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O yes, she must be dead long since: she was seventy when I as a child
      knew her,' he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I can recollect Mrs. Winter very well, if nobody else can,' said the aged
      groceress. 'Yes, she's been dead these five-and-twenty year at least. You
      knew what it was upon her mind, sir, that gave her that hollow-eyed look,
      I suppose?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It had something to do with a son of hers, I think I once was told. But I
      was too young to know particulars.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The groceress sighed as she conjured up a vision of days long past. 'Yes,'
      she murmured, 'it had all to do with a son.' Finding that the van was
      still in a listening mood, she spoke on:-

    <h2>
      THE WINTERS AND THE PALMLEYS
    </h2>
    <p>
      'To go back to the beginning-if one must-there were two women in the
      parish when I was a child, who were to a certain extent rivals in good
      looks. Never mind particulars, but in consequence of this they were at
      daggers-drawn, and they did not love each other any better when one of
      them tempted the other's lover away from her and married him. He was a
      young man of the name of Winter, and in due time they had a son.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The other woman did not marry for many years: but when she was about
      thirty a quiet man named Palmley asked her to be his wife, and she
      accepted him. You don't mind when the Palmleys were Longpuddle folk, but I
      do well. She had a son also, who was, of course, nine or ten years younger
      than the son of the first. The child proved to be of rather weak
      intellect, though his mother loved him as the apple of her eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      'This woman's husband died when the child was eight years old, and left
      his widow and boy in poverty. Her former rival, also a widow now, but
      fairly well provided for, offered for pity's sake to take the child as
      errand-boy, small as he was, her own son, Jack, being hard upon seventeen.
      Her poor neighbour could do no better than let the child go there. And to
      the richer woman's house little Palmley straightway went.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, in some way or other-how, it was never exactly known-the thriving
      woman, Mrs. Winter, sent the little boy with a message to the next village
      one December day, much against his will. It was getting dark, and the
      child prayed to be allowed not to go, because he would be afraid coming
      home. But the mistress insisted, more out of thoughtlessness than cruelty,
      and the child went. On his way back he had to pass through Yalbury Wood,
      and something came out from behind a tree and frightened him into fits.
      The child was quite ruined by it; he became quite a drivelling idiot, and
      soon afterward died.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then the other woman had nothing left to live for, and vowed vengeance
      against that rival who had first won away her lover, and now had been the
      cause of her bereavement. This last affliction was certainly not intended
      by her thriving acquaintance, though it must be owned that when it was
      done she seemed but little concerned. Whatever vengeance poor Mrs. Palmley
      felt, she had no opportunity of carrying it out, and time might have
      softened her feelings into forgetfulness of her supposed wrongs as she
      dragged on her lonely life. So matters stood when, a year after the death
      of the child, Mrs. Palmley's niece, who had been born and bred in the city
      of Exonbury, came to live with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'This young woman-Miss Harriet Palmley-was a proud and handsome girl, very
      well brought up, and more stylish and genteel than the people of our
      village, as was natural, considering where she came from. She regarded
      herself as much above Mrs. Winter and her son in position as Mrs. Winter
      and her son considered themselves above poor Mrs. Palmley. But love is an
      unceremonious thing, and what in the world should happen but that young
      Jack Winter must fall wofully and wildly in love with Harriet Palmley
      almost as soon as he saw her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'She, being better educated than he, and caring nothing for the village
      notion of his mother's superiority to her aunt, did not give him much
      encouragement. But Longpuddle being no very large world, the two could not
      help seeing a good deal of each other while she was staying there, and,
      disdainful young woman as she was, she did seem to take a little pleasure
      in his attentions and advances.
    </p>
    <p>
      'One day when they were picking apples together, he asked her to marry
      him. She had not expected anything so practical as that at so early a
      time, and was led by her surprise into a half-promise; at any rate she did
      not absolutely refuse him, and accepted some little presents that he made
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But he saw that her view of him was rather as a simple village lad than
      as a young man to look up to, and he felt that he must do something bold
      to secure her. So he said one day, "I am going away, to try to get into a
      better position than I can get here." In two or three weeks he wished her
      good-bye, and went away to Monksbury, to superintend a farm, with a view
      to start as a farmer himself; and from there he wrote regularly to her, as
      if their marriage were an understood thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now Harriet liked the young man's presents and the admiration of his
      eyes; but on paper he was less attractive to her. Her mother had been a
      school-mistress, and Harriet had besides a natural aptitude for pen-and-
      ink work, in days when to be a ready writer was not such a common thing as
      it is now, and when actual handwriting was valued as an accomplishment in
      itself. Jack Winter's performances in the shape of love-letters quite
      jarred her city nerves and her finer taste, and when she answered one of
      them, in the lovely running hand that she took such pride in, she very
      strictly and loftily bade him to practise with a pen and spelling-book if
      he wished to please her. Whether he listened to her request or not nobody
      knows, but his letters did not improve. He ventured to tell her in his
      clumsy way that if her heart were more warm towards him she would not be
      so nice about his handwriting and spelling; which indeed was true enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, in Jack's absence the weak flame that had been set alight in
      Harriet's heart soon sank low, and at last went out altogether. He wrote
      and wrote, and begged and prayed her to give a reason for her coldness;
      and then she told him plainly that she was town born, and he was not
      sufficiently well educated to please her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Jack Winter's want of pen-and-ink training did not make him less thin-
      skinned than others; in fact, he was terribly tender and touchy about
      anything. This reason that she gave for finally throwing him over grieved
      him, shamed him, and mortified him more than can be told in these times,
      the pride of that day in being able to write with beautiful flourishes,
      and the sorrow at not being able to do so, raging so high. Jack replied to
      her with an angry note, and then she hit back with smart little stings,
      telling him how many words he had misspelt in his last letter, and
      declaring again that this alone was sufficient justification for any woman
      to put an end to an understanding with him. Her husband must be a better
      scholar.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He bore her rejection of him in silence, but his suffering was sharp-all
      the sharper in being untold. She communicated with Jack no more; and as
      his reason for going out into the world had been only to provide a home
      worthy of her, he had no further object in planning such a home now that
      she was lost to him. He therefore gave up the farming occupation by which
      he had hoped to make himself a master-farmer, and left the spot to return
      to his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      'As soon as he got back to Longpuddle he found that Harriet had already
      looked wi' favour upon another lover. He was a young road-contractor, and
      Jack could not but admit that his rival was both in manners and
      scholarship much ahead of him. Indeed, a more sensible match for the
      beauty who had been dropped into the village by fate could hardly have
      been found than this man, who could offer her so much better a chance than
      Jack could have done, with his uncertain future and narrow abilities for
      grappling with the world. The fact was so clear to him that he could
      hardly blame her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'One day by accident Jack saw on a scrap of paper the handwriting of
      Harriet's new beloved. It was flowing like a stream, well spelt, the work
      of a man accustomed to the ink-bottle and the dictionary, of a man already
      called in the parish a good scholar. And then it struck all of a sudden
      into Jack's mind what a contrast the letters of this young man must make
      to his own miserable old letters, and how ridiculous they must make his
      lines appear. He groaned and wished he had never written to her, and
      wondered if she had ever kept his poor performances. Possibly she had kept
      them, for women are in the habit of doing that, he thought, and whilst
      they were in her hands there was always a chance of his honest, stupid
      love-assurances to her being joked over by Harriet with her present lover,
      or by anybody who should accidentally uncover them.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The nervous, moody young man could not bear the thought of it, and at
      length decided to ask her to return them, as was proper when engagements
      were broken off. He was some hours in framing, copying, and recopying the
      short note in which he made his request, and having finished it he sent it
      to her house. His messenger came back with the answer, by word of mouth,
      that Miss Palmley bade him say she should not part with what was hers, and
      wondered at his boldness in troubling her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Jack was much affronted at this, and determined to go for his letters
      himself. He chose a time when he knew she was at home, and knocked and
      went in without much ceremony; for though Harriet was so high and mighty,
      Jack had small respect for her aunt, Mrs. Palmley, whose little child had
      been his boot-cleaner in earlier days. Harriet was in the room, this being
      the first time they had met since she had jilted him. He asked for his
      letters with a stern and bitter look at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'At first she said he might have them for all that she cared, and took
      them out of the bureau where she kept them. Then she glanced over the
      outside one of the packet, and suddenly altering her mind, she told him
      shortly that his request was a silly one, and slipped the letters into her
      aunt's work-box, which stood open on the table, locking it, and saying
      with a bantering laugh that of course she thought it best to keep 'em,
      since they might be useful to produce as evidence that she had good cause
      for declining to marry him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He blazed up hot. "Give me those letters!" he said. "They are mine!"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"No, they are not," she replied; "they are mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Whos'ever they are I want them back," says he. "I don't want to be made
      sport of for my penmanship: you've another young man now! he has your
      confidence, and you pour all your tales into his ear. You'll be showing
      them to him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Perhaps," said my lady Harriet, with calm coolness, like the heartless
      woman that she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Her manner so maddened him that he made a step towards the work-box, but
      she snatched it up, locked it in the bureau, and turned upon him
      triumphant. For a moment he seemed to be going to wrench the key of the
      bureau out of her hand; but he stopped himself, and swung round upon his
      heel and went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      'When he was out-of-doors alone, and it got night, he walked about
      restless, and stinging with the sense of being beaten at all points by
      her. He could not help fancying her telling her new lover or her
      acquaintances of this scene with himself, and laughing with them over
      those poor blotted, crooked lines of his that he had been so anxious to
      obtain. As the evening passed on he worked himself into a dogged
      resolution to have them back at any price, come what might.
    </p>
    <p>
      'At the dead of night he came out of his mother's house by the back door,
      and creeping through the garden hedge went along the field adjoining till
      he reached the back of her aunt's dwelling. The moon struck bright and
      flat upon the walls, 'twas said, and every shiny leaf of the creepers was
      like a little looking-glass in the rays. From long acquaintance Jack knew
      the arrangement and position of everything in Mrs. Palmley's house as well
      as in his own mother's. The back window close to him was a casement with
      little leaded squares, as it is to this day, and was, as now, one of two
      lighting the sitting-room. The other, being in front, was closed up with
      shutters, but this back one had not even a blind, and the moonlight as it
      streamed in showed every article of the furniture to him outside. To the
      right of the room is the fireplace, as you may remember; to the left was
      the bureau at that time; inside the bureau was Harriet's work-box, as he
      supposed (though it was really her aunt's), and inside the work-box were
      his letters. Well, he took out his pocket-knife, and without noise lifted
      the leading of one of the panes, so that he could take out the glass, and
      putting his hand through the hole he unfastened the casement, and climbed
      in through the opening. All the household-that is to say, Mrs. Palmley,
      Harriet, and the little maid-servant-were asleep. Jack went straight to
      the bureau, so he said, hoping it might have been unfastened again-it not
      being kept locked in ordinary-but Harriet had never unfastened it since
      she secured her letters there the day before. Jack told afterward how he
      thought of her asleep upstairs, caring nothing for him, and of the way she
      had made sport of him and of his letters; and having advanced so far, he
      was not to be hindered now. By forcing the large blade of his knife under
      the flap of the bureau, he burst the weak lock; within was the rosewood
      work-box just as she had placed it in her hurry to keep it from him. There
      being no time to spare for getting the letters out of it then, he took it
      under his arm, shut the bureau, and made the best of his way out of the
      house, latching the casement behind him, and refixing the pane of glass in
      its place.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Winter found his way back to his mother's as he had come, and being
      dog-tired, crept upstairs to bed, hiding the box till he could destroy its
      contents. The next morning early he set about doing this, and carried it
      to the linhay at the back of his mother's dwelling. Here by the hearth he
      opened the box, and began burning one by one the letters that had cost him
      so much labour to write and shame to think of, meaning to return the box
      to Harriet, after repairing the slight damage he had caused it by opening
      it without a key, with a note-the last she would ever receive from
      him-telling her triumphantly that in refusing to return what he had asked
      for she had calculated too surely upon his submission to her whims.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But on removing the last letter from the box he received a shock; for
      underneath it, at the very bottom, lay money-several golden
      guineas-"Doubtless Harriet's pocket-money," he said to himself; though it
      was not, but Mrs. Palmley's. Before he had got over his qualms at this
      discovery he heard footsteps coming through the house-passage to where he
      was. In haste he pushed the box and what was in it under some brushwood
      which lay in the linhay; but Jack had been already seen. Two constables
      entered the out-house, and seized him as he knelt before the fireplace,
      securing the work-box and all it contained at the same moment. They had
      come to apprehend him on a charge of breaking into the dwelling-house of
      Mrs. Palmley on the night preceding; and almost before the lad knew what
      had happened to him they were leading him along the lane that connects
      that end of the village with this turnpike-road, and along they marched
      him between 'em all the way to Casterbridge jail.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Jack's act amounted to night burglary-though he had never thought of
      it-and burglary was felony, and a capital offence in those days. His
      figure had been seen by some one against the bright wall as he came away
      from Mrs. Palmley's back window, and the box and money were found in his
      possession, while the evidence of the broken bureau-lock and tinkered
      window-pane was more than enough for circumstantial detail. Whether his
      protestation that he went only for his letters, which he believed to be
      wrongfully kept from him, would have availed him anything if supported by
      other evidence I do not know; but the one person who could have borne it
      out was Harriet, and she acted entirely under the sway of her aunt. That
      aunt was deadly towards Jack Winter. Mrs. Palmley's time had come. Here
      was her revenge upon the woman who had first won away her lover, and next
      ruined and deprived her of her heart's treasure-her little son. When the
      assize week drew on, and Jack had to stand his trial, Harriet did not
      appear in the case at all, which was allowed to take its course, Mrs.
      Palmley testifying to the general facts of the burglary. Whether Harriet
      would have come forward if Jack had appealed to her is not known; possibly
      she would have done it for pity's sake; but Jack was too proud to ask a
      single favour of a girl who had jilted him; and he let her alone. The
      trial was a short one, and the death sentence was passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The day o' young Jack's execution was a cold dusty Saturday in March. He
      was so boyish and slim that they were obliged in mercy to hang him in the
      heaviest fetters kept in the jail, lest his heft should not break his
      neck, and they weighed so upon him that he could hardly drag himself up to
      the drop. At that time the gover'ment was not strict about burying the
      body of an executed person within the precincts of the prison, and at the
      earnest prayer of his poor mother his body was allowed to be brought home.
      All the parish waited at their cottage doors in the evening for its
      arrival: I remember how, as a very little girl, I stood by my mother's
      side. About eight o'clock, as we hearkened on our door-stones in the cold
      bright starlight, we could hear the faint crackle of a waggon from the
      direction of the turnpike-road. The noise was lost as the waggon dropped
      into a hollow, then it was plain again as it lumbered down the next long
      incline, and presently it entered Longpuddle. The coffin was laid in the
      belfry for the night, and the next day, Sunday, between the services, we
      buried him. A funeral sermon was preached the same afternoon, the text
      chosen being, "He was the only son of his mother, and she was a widow." .
      . . Yes, they were cruel times!
    </p>
    <p>
      'As for Harriet, she and her lover were married in due time; but by all
      account her life was no jocund one. She and her good-man found that they
      could not live comfortably at Longpuddle, by reason of her connection with
      Jack's misfortunes, and they settled in a distant town, and were no more
      heard of by us; Mrs. Palmley, too, found it advisable to join 'em shortly
      after. The dark-eyed, gaunt old Mrs. Winter, remembered by the emigrant
      gentleman here, was, as you will have foreseen, the Mrs. Winter of this
      story; and I can well call to mind how lonely she was, how afraid the
      children were of her, and how she kept herself as a stranger among us,
      though she lived so long.'
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      'Longpuddle has had her sad experiences as well as her sunny ones,' said
      Mr. Lackland.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, yes. But I am thankful to say not many like that, though good and
      bad have lived among us.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'There was Georgy Crookhill-he was one of the shady sort, as I have reason
      to know,' observed the registrar, with the manner of a man who would like
      to have his say also.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I used to hear what he was as a boy at school.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, as he began so he went on. It never got so far as a hanging matter
      with him, to be sure; but he had some narrow escapes of penal servitude;
      and once it was a case of the biter bit.'

    <h2>
      INCIDENT IN THE LIFE OF MR. GEORGE CROOKHILL
    </h2>
    <p>
      'One day,' the registrar continued, 'Georgy was ambling out of Melchester
      on a miserable screw, the fair being just over, when he saw in front of
      him a fine-looking young farmer riding out of the town in the same
      direction. He was mounted on a good strong handsome animal, worth fifty
      guineas if worth a crown. When they were going up Bissett Hill, Georgy
      made it his business to overtake the young farmer. They passed the time o'
      day to one another; Georgy spoke of the state of the roads, and jogged
      alongside the well-mounted stranger in very friendly conversation. The
      farmer had not been inclined to say much to Georgy at first, but by
      degrees he grew quite affable too-as friendly as Georgy was toward him. He
      told Crookhill that he had been doing business at Melchester fair, and was
      going on as far as Shottsford-Forum that night, so as to reach
      Casterbridge market the next day. When they came to Woodyates Inn they
      stopped to bait their horses, and agreed to drink together; with this they
      got more friendly than ever, and on they went again. Before they had
      nearly reached Shottsford it came on to rain, and as they were now passing
      through the village of Trantridge, and it was quite dark, Georgy persuaded
      the young farmer to go no further that night; the rain would most likely
      give them a chill. For his part he had heard that the little inn here was
      comfortable, and he meant to stay. At last the young farmer agreed to put
      up there also; and they dismounted, and entered, and had a good supper
      together, and talked over their affairs like men who had known and proved
      each other a long time. When it was the hour for retiring they went
      upstairs to a double-bedded room which Georgy Crookhill had asked the
      landlord to let them share, so sociable were they.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Before they fell asleep they talked across the room about one thing and
      another, running from this to that till the conversation turned upon
      disguises, and changing clothes for particular ends. The farmer told
      Georgy that he had often heard tales of people doing it; but Crookhill
      professed to be very ignorant of all such tricks; and soon the young
      farmer sank into slumber.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Early in the morning, while the tall young farmer was still asleep (I
      tell the story as 'twas told me), honest Georgy crept out of his bed by
      stealth, and dressed himself in the farmer's clothes, in the pockets of
      the said clothes being the farmer's money. Now though Georgy particularly
      wanted the farmer's nice clothes and nice horse, owing to a little
      transaction at the fair which made it desirable that he should not be too
      easily recognized, his desires had their bounds: he did not wish to take
      his young friend's money, at any rate more of it than was necessary for
      paying his bill. This he abstracted, and leaving the farmer's purse
      containing the rest on the bedroom table, went downstairs. The inn folks
      had not particularly noticed the faces of their customers, and the one or
      two who were up at this hour had no thought but that Georgy was the
      farmer; so when he had paid the bill very liberally, and said he must be
      off, no objection was made to his getting the farmer's horse saddled for
      himself; and he rode away upon it as if it were his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      'About half an hour after the young farmer awoke, and looking across the
      room saw that his friend Georgy had gone away in clothes which didn't
      belong to him, and had kindly left for himself the seedy ones worn by
      Georgy. At this he sat up in a deep thought for some time, instead of
      hastening to give an alarm. "The money, the money is gone," he said to
      himself, "and that's bad. But so are the clothes."
    </p>
    <p>
      'He then looked upon the table and saw that the money, or most of it, had
      been left behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Ha, ha, ha!" he cried, and began to dance about the room. "Ha, ha, ha!"
      he said again, and made beautiful smiles to himself in the shaving glass
      and in the brass candlestick; and then swung about his arms for all the
      world as if he were going through the sword exercise.
    </p>
    <p>
      'When he had dressed himself in Georgy's clothes and gone downstairs, he
      did not seem to mind at all that they took him for the other; and even
      when he saw that he had been left a bad horse for a good one, he was not
      inclined to cry out. They told him his friend had paid the bill, at which
      he seemed much pleased, and without waiting for breakfast he mounted
      Georgy's horse and rode away likewise, choosing the nearest by- lane in
      preference to the high-road, without knowing that Georgy had chosen that
      by-lane also.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He had not trotted more than two miles in the personal character of
      Georgy Crookhill when, suddenly rounding a bend that the lane made
      thereabout, he came upon a man struggling in the hands of two village
      constables. It was his friend Georgy, the borrower of his clothes and
      horse. But so far was the young farmer from showing any alacrity in
      rushing forward to claim his property that he would have turned the poor
      beast he rode into the wood adjoining, if he had not been already
      perceived.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Help, help, help!" cried the constables. "Assistance in the name of the
      Crown!"
    </p>
    <p>
      'The young farmer could do nothing but ride forward. "What's the matter?"
      he inquired, as coolly as he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"A deserter-a deserter!" said they. "One who's to be tried by court-
      martial and shot without parley. He deserted from the Dragoons at
      Cheltenham some days ago, and was tracked; but the search-party can't find
      him anywhere, and we told 'em if we met him we'd hand him on to 'em
      forthwith. The day after he left the barracks the rascal met a respectable
      farmer and made him drunk at an inn, and told him what a fine soldier he
      would make, and coaxed him to change clothes, to see how well a military
      uniform would become him. This the simple farmer did; when our deserter
      said that for a joke he would leave the room and go to the landlady, to
      see if she would know him in that dress. He never came back, and Farmer
      Jollice found himself in soldier's clothes, the money in his pockets gone,
      and, when he got to the stable, his horse gone too."
    </p>
    <p>
      '"A scoundrel!" says the young man in Georgy's clothes. "And is this the
      wretched caitiff?" (pointing to Georgy).
    </p>
    <p>
      '"No, no!" cries Georgy, as innocent as a babe of this matter of the
      soldier's desertion. "He's the man! He was wearing Farmer Jollice's suit
      o' clothes, and he slept in the same room wi' me, and brought up the
      subject of changing clothes, which put it into my head to dress myself in
      his suit before he was awake. He's got on mine!"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"D'ye hear the villain?" groans the tall young man to the constables.
      "Trying to get out of his crime by charging the first innocent man with it
      that he sees! No, master soldier-that won't do!"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"No, no! That won't do!" the constables chimed in. "To have the impudence
      to say such as that, when we caught him in the act almost! But, thank God,
      we've got the handcuffs on him at last."
    </p>
    <p>
      '"We have, thank God," said the tall young man. "Well, I must move on.
      Good luck to ye with your prisoner!" And off he went, as fast as his poor
      jade would carry him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The constables then, with Georgy handcuffed between 'em, and leading the
      horse, marched off in the other direction, toward the village where they
      had been accosted by the escort of soldiers sent to bring the deserter
      back, Georgy groaning: "I shall be shot, I shall be shot!" They had not
      gone more than a mile before they met them.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Hoi, there!" says the head constable.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Hoi, yerself!" says the corporal in charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"We've got your man," says the constable.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Where?" says the corporal.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Here, between us," said the constable. "Only you don't recognize him out
      o' uniform."
    </p>
    <p>
      'The corporal looked at Georgy hard enough; then shook his head and said
      he was not the absconder.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"But the absconder changed clothes with Farmer Jollice, and took his
      horse; and this man has 'em, d'ye see!"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"'Tis not our man," said the soldiers. "He's a tall young fellow with a
      mole on his right cheek, and a military bearing, which this man decidedly
      has not."
    </p>
    <p>
      '"I told the two officers of justice that 'twas the other!" pleaded
      Georgy. "But they wouldn't believe me."
    </p>
    <p>
      'And so it became clear that the missing dragoon was the tall young
      farmer, and not Georgy Crookhill-a fact which Farmer Jollice himself
      corroborated when he arrived on the scene. As Georgy had only robbed the
      robber, his sentence was comparatively light. The deserter from the
      Dragoons was never traced: his double shift of clothing having been of the
      greatest advantage to him in getting off; though he left Georgy's horse
      behind him a few miles ahead, having found the poor creature more
      hindrance than aid.'

      The man from abroad seemed to be less interested in the questionable
      characters of Longpuddle and their strange adventures than in the ordinary
      inhabitants and the ordinary events, though his local fellow- travellers
      preferred the former as subjects of discussion. He now for the first time
      asked concerning young persons of the opposite sex-or rather those who had
      been young when he left his native land. His informants, adhering to their
      own opinion that the remarkable was better worth telling than the
      ordinary, would not allow him to dwell upon the simple chronicles of those
      who had merely come and gone. They asked him if he remembered Netty
      Sargent.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Netty Sargent-I do, just remember her. She was a young woman living with
      her uncle when I left, if my childish recollection may be trusted.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That was the maid. She was a oneyer, if you like, sir. Not any harm in
      her, you know, but up to everything. You ought to hear how she got the
      copyhold of her house extended. Oughtn't he, Mr. Day?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He ought,' replied the world-ignored old painter.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Tell him, Mr. Day. Nobody can do it better than you, and you know the
      legal part better than some of us.'

    <h2>
      NETTY SARGENT'S COPYHOLD
    </h2>
    <p>
      'She continued to live with her uncle, in the lonely house by the copse,
      just as at the time you knew her; a tall spry young woman. Ah, how well
      one can remember her black hair and dancing eyes at that time, and her sly
      way of screwing up her mouth when she meant to tease ye! Well, she was
      hardly out of short frocks before the chaps were after her, and by long
      and by late she was courted by a young man whom perhaps you did not
      know-Jasper Cliff was his name-and, though she might have had many a
      better fellow, he so greatly took her fancy that 'twas Jasper or nobody
      for her. He was a selfish customer, always thinking less of what he was
      going to do than of what he was going to gain by his doings. Jasper's eyes
      might have been fixed upon Netty, but his mind was upon her uncle's house;
      though he was fond of her in his way-I admit that.
    </p>
    <p>
      'This house, built by her great-great-grandfather, with its garden and
      little field, was copyhold-granted upon lives in the old way, and had been
      so granted for generations. Her uncle's was the last life upon the
      property; so that at his death, if there was no admittance of new lives,
      it would all fall into the hands of the lord of the manor. But 'twas easy
      to admit-a slight "fine," as 'twas called, of a few pounds, was enough to
      entitle him to a new deed o' grant by the custom of the manor; and the
      lord could not hinder it.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now there could be no better provision for his niece and only relative
      than a sure house over her head, and Netty's uncle should have seen to the
      renewal in time, owing to the peculiar custom of forfeiture by the
      dropping of the last life before the new fine was paid; for the Squire was
      very anxious to get hold of the house and land; and every Sunday when the
      old man came into the church and passed the Squire's pew, the Squire would
      say, "A little weaker in his knees, a little crookeder in his back-and the
      readmittance not applied for: ha! ha! I shall be able to make a complete
      clearing of that corner of the manor some day!"
    </p>
    <p>
      ''Twas extraordinary, now we look back upon it, that old Sargent should
      have been so dilatory; yet some people are like it; and he put off calling
      at the Squire's agent's office with the fine week after week, saying to
      himself, "I shall have more time next market-day than I have now." One
      unfortunate hindrance was that he didn't very well like Jasper Cliff; and
      as Jasper kept urging Netty, and Netty on that account kept urging her
      uncle, the old man was inclined to postpone the re- liveing as long as he
      could, to spite the selfish young lover. At last old Mr. Sargent fell ill,
      and then Jasper could bear it no longer: he produced the fine-money
      himself, and handed it to Netty, and spoke to her plainly.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"You and your uncle ought to know better. You should press him more.
      There's the money. If you let the house and ground slip between ye, I
      won't marry; hang me if I will! For folks won't deserve a husband that can
      do such things."
    </p>
    <p>
      'The worried girl took the money and went home, and told her uncle that it
      was no house no husband for her. Old Mr. Sargent pooh-poohed the money,
      for the amount was not worth consideration, but he did now bestir himself;
      for he saw she was bent upon marrying Jasper, and he did not wish to make
      her unhappy, since she was so determined. It was much to the Squire's
      annoyance that he found Sargent had moved in the matter at last; but he
      could not gainsay it, and the documents were prepared (for on this manor
      the copy-holders had writings with their holdings, though on some manors
      they had none). Old Sargent being now too feeble to go to the agent's
      house, the deed was to be brought to his house signed, and handed over as
      a receipt for the money; the counterpart to be signed by Sargent, and sent
      back to the Squire.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The agent had promised to call on old Sargent for this purpose at five
      o'clock, and Netty put the money into her desk to have it close at hand.
      While doing this she heard a slight cry from her uncle, and turning round,
      saw that he had fallen forward in his chair. She went and lifted him, but
      he was unconscious; and unconscious he remained. Neither medicine nor
      stimulants would bring him to himself. She had been told that he might
      possibly go off in that way, and it seemed as if the end had come. Before
      she had started for a doctor his face and extremities grew quite cold and
      white, and she saw that help would be useless. He was stone-dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Netty's situation rose upon her distracted mind in all its seriousness.
      The house, garden, and field were lost-by a few hours-and with them a home
      for herself and her lover. She would not think so meanly of Jasper as to
      suppose that he would adhere to the resolution declared in a moment of
      impatience; but she trembled, nevertheless. Why could not her uncle have
      lived a couple of hours longer, since he had lived so long? It was now
      past three o'clock; at five the agent was to call, and, if all had gone
      well, by ten minutes past five the house and holding would have been
      securely hers for her own and Jasper's lives, these being two of the three
      proposed to be added by paying the fine. How that wretched old Squire
      would rejoice at getting the little tenancy into his hands! He did not
      really require it, but constitutionally hated these tiny copyholds and
      leaseholds and freeholds, which made islands of independence in the fair,
      smooth ocean of his estates.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then an idea struck into the head of Netty how to accomplish her object
      in spite of her uncle's negligence. It was a dull December afternoon: and
      the first step in her scheme-so the story goes, and I see no reason to
      doubt it-'
    </p>
    <p>
      ''Tis true as the light,' affirmed Christopher Twink. 'I was just passing
      by.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The first step in her scheme was to fasten the outer door, to make sure
      of not being interrupted. Then she set to work by placing her uncle's
      small, heavy oak table before the fire; then she went to her uncle's
      corpse, sitting in the chair as he had died-a stuffed arm-chair, on
      casters, and rather high in the seat, so it was told me-and wheeled the
      chair, uncle and all, to the table, placing him with his back toward the
      window, in the attitude of bending over the said oak table, which I knew
      as a boy as well as I know any piece of furniture in my own house. On the
      table she laid the large family Bible open before him, and placed his
      forefinger on the page; and then she opened his eyelids a bit, and put on
      him his spectacles, so that from behind he appeared for all the world as
      if he were reading the Scriptures. Then she unfastened the door and sat
      down, and when it grew dark she lit a candle, and put it on the table
      beside her uncle's book.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Folk may well guess how the time passed with her till the agent came, and
      how, when his knock sounded upon the door, she nearly started out of her
      skin-at least that's as it was told me. Netty promptly went to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"I am sorry, sir," she says, under her breath; "my uncle is not so well
      to-night, and I'm afraid he can't see you."
    </p>
    <p>
      '"H'm!-that's a pretty tale," says the steward. "So I've come all this way
      about this trumpery little job for nothing!"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"O no, sir-I hope not," says Netty. "I suppose the business of granting
      the new deed can be done just the same?"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Done? Certainly not. He must pay the renewal money, and sign the
      parchment in my presence."
    </p>
    <p>
      'She looked dubious. "Uncle is so dreadful nervous about law business,"
      says she, "that, as you know, he's put it off and put it off for years;
      and now to-day really I've feared it would verily drive him out of his
      mind. His poor three teeth quite chattered when I said to him that you
      would be here soon with the parchment writing. He always was afraid of
      agents, and folks that come for rent, and such-like."
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Poor old fellow-I'm sorry for him. Well, the thing can't be done unless
      I see him and witness his signature."
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Suppose, sir, that you see him sign, and he don't see you looking at
      him? I'd soothe his nerves by saying you weren't strict about the form of
      witnessing, and didn't wish to come in. So that it was done in your bare
      presence it would be sufficient, would it not? As he's such an old,
      shrinking, shivering man, it would be a great considerateness on your part
      if that would do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"In my bare presence would do, of course-that's all I come for. But how
      can I be a witness without his seeing me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Why, in this way, sir; if you'll oblige me by just stepping here." She
      conducted him a few yards to the left, till they were opposite the parlour
      window. The blind had been left up purposely, and the candle- light shone
      out upon the garden bushes. Within the agent could see, at the other end
      of the room, the back and side of the old man's head, and his shoulders
      and arm, sitting with the book and candle before him, and his spectacles
      on his nose, as she had placed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"He's reading his Bible, as you see, sir," she says, quite in her meekest
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Yes. I thought he was a careless sort of man in matters of religion?"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"He always was fond of his Bible," Netty assured him. "Though I think
      he's nodding over it just at this moment However, that's natural in an old
      man, and unwell. Now you could stand here and see him sign, couldn't you,
      sir, as he's such an invalid?"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Very well," said the agent, lighting a cigar. "You have ready by you the
      merely nominal sum you'll have to pay for the admittance, of course?"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Yes," said Netty. "I'll bring it out." She fetched the cash, wrapped in
      paper, and handed it to him, and when he had counted it the steward took
      from his breast pocket the precious parchments and gave one to her to be
      signed.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Uncle's hand is a little paralyzed," she said. "And what with his being
      half asleep, too, really I don't know what sort of a signature he'll be
      able to make."
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Doesn't matter, so that he signs."
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Might I hold his hand?"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Ay, hold his hand, my young woman-that will be near enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      'Netty re-entered the house, and the agent continued smoking outside the
      window. Now came the ticklish part of Netty's performance. The steward saw
      her put the inkhorn-"horn," says I in my old-fashioned way-the inkstand,
      before her uncle, and touch his elbow as to arouse him, and speak to him,
      and spread out the deed; when she had pointed to show him where to sign
      she dipped the pen and put it into his hand. To hold his hand she artfully
      stepped behind him, so that the agent could only see a little bit of his
      head, and the hand she held; but he saw the old man's hand trace his name
      on the document. As soon as 'twas done she came out to the steward with
      the parchment in her hand, and the steward signed as witness by the light
      from the parlour window. Then he gave her the deed signed by the Squire,
      and left; and next morning Netty told the neighbours that her uncle was
      dead in his bed.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She must have undressed him and put him there.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She must. Oh, that girl had a nerve, I can tell ye! Well, to cut a long
      story short, that's how she got back the house and field that were,
      strictly speaking, gone from her; and by getting them, got her a husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Every virtue has its reward, they say. Netty had hers for her ingenious
      contrivance to gain Jasper. Two years after they were married he took to
      beating her-not hard, you know; just a smack or two, enough to set her in
      a temper, and let out to the neighbours what she had done to win him, and
      how she repented of her pains. When the old Squire was dead, and his son
      came into the property, this confession of hers began to be whispered
      about. But Netty was a pretty young woman, and the Squire's son was a
      pretty young man at that time, and wider-minded than his father, having no
      objection to little holdings; and he never took any proceedings against
      her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      There was now a lull in the discourse, and soon the van descended the hill
      leading into the long straggling village. When the houses were reached the
      passengers dropped off one by one, each at his or her own door. Arrived at
      the inn, the returned emigrant secured a bed, and having eaten a light
      meal, sallied forth upon the scene he had known so well in his early days.
      Though flooded with the light of the rising moon, none of the objects wore
      the attractiveness in this their real presentation that had ever
      accompanied their images in the field of his imagination when he was more
      than two thousand miles removed from them. The peculiar charm attaching to
      an old village in an old country, as seen by the eyes of an absolute
      foreigner, was lowered in his case by magnified expectations from
      infantine memories. He walked on, looking at this chimney and that old
      wall, till he came to the churchyard, which he entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The head-stones, whitened by the moon, were easily decipherable; and now
      for the first time Lackland began to feel himself amid the village
      community that he had left behind him five-and-thirty years before. Here,
      besides the Sallets, the Darths, the Pawles, the Privetts, the Sargents,
      and others of whom he had just heard, were names he remembered even better
      than those: the Jickses, and the Crosses, and the Knights, and the Olds.
      Doubtless representatives of these families, or some of them, were yet
      among the living; but to him they would all be as strangers. Far from
      finding his heart ready-supplied with roots and tendrils here, he
      perceived that in returning to this spot it would be incumbent upon him to
      re-establish himself from the beginning, precisely as though he had never
      known the place, nor it him. Time had not condescended to wait his
      pleasure, nor local life his greeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The figure of Mr. Lackland was seen at the inn, and in the village street,
      and in the fields and lanes about Upper Longpuddle, for a few days after
      his arrival, and then, ghost-like, it silently disappeared. He had told
      some of the villagers that his immediate purpose in coming had been
      fulfilled by a sight of the place, and by conversation with its
      inhabitants: but that his ulterior purpose-of coming to spend his latter
      days among them-would probably never be carried out. It is now a dozen or
      fifteen years since his visit was paid, and his face has not again been
      seen.

      PREFACE
    </h2>
    <p>
      The pedigrees of our county families, arranged in diagrams on the pages of
      county histories, mostly appear at first sight to be as barren of any
      touch of nature as a table of logarithms. But given a clue-the faintest
      tradition of what went on behind the scenes, and this dryness as of dust
      may be transformed into a palpitating drama. More, the careful comparison
      of dates alone-that of birth with marriage, of marriage with death, of one
      marriage, birth, or death with a kindred marriage, birth, or death-will
      often effect the same transformation, and anybody practised in raising
      images from such genealogies finds himself unconsciously filling into the
      framework the motives, passions, and personal qualities which would appear
      to be the single explanation possible of some extraordinary conjunction in
      times, events, and personages that occasionally marks these reticent
      family records.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of such pedigrees and supplementary material most of the following
      stories have arisen and taken shape.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would make this preface an opportunity of expressing my sense of the
      courtesy and kindness of several bright-eyed Noble Dames yet in the flesh,
      who, since the first publication of these tales in periodicals, six or
      seven years ago, have given me interesting comments and conjectures on
      such of the narratives as they have recognized to be connected with their
      own families, residences, or traditions; in which they have shown a truly
      philosophic absence of prejudice in their regard of those incidents whose
      relation has tended more distinctly to dramatize than to eulogize their
      ancestors. The outlines they have also given of other singular events in
      their family histories for use in a second "Group of Noble Dames," will, I
      fear, never reach the printing- press through me; but I shall store them
      up in memory of my informants' good nature.

    <h2>
      DAME THE FIRST-THE FIRST COUNTESS OF WESSEX
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By the Local Historian
    </h3>
    <p>
      King's-Hintock Court (said the narrator, turning over his memoranda for
      reference)-King's-Hintock Court is, as we know, one of the most imposing
      of the mansions that overlook our beautiful Blackmoor or Blakemore Vale.
      On the particular occasion of which I have to speak this building stood,
      as it had often stood before, in the perfect silence of a calm clear
      night, lighted only by the cold shine of the stars. The season was winter,
      in days long ago, the last century having run but little more than a third
      of its length. North, south, and west, not a casement was unfastened, not
      a curtain undrawn; eastward, one window on the upper floor was open, and a
      girl of twelve or thirteen was leaning over the sill. That she had not
      taken up the position for purposes of observation was apparent at a
      glance, for she kept her eyes covered with her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room occupied by the girl was an inner one of a suite, to be reached
      only by passing through a large bedchamber adjoining. From this apartment
      voices in altercation were audible, everything else in the building being
      so still. It was to avoid listening to these voices that the girl had left
      her little cot, thrown a cloak round her head and shoulders, and stretched
      into the night air.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she could not escape the conversation, try as she would. The words
      reached her in all their painfulness, one sentence in masculine tones,
      those of her father, being repeated many times.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I tell 'ee there shall be no such betrothal! I tell 'ee there sha'n't! A
      child like her!'
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew the subject of dispute to be herself. A cool feminine voice, her
      mother's, replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      'Have done with you, and be wise. He is willing to wait a good five or six
      years before the marriage takes place, and there's not a man in the county
      to compare with him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It shall not be! He is over thirty. It is wickedness.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He is just thirty, and the best and finest man alive-a perfect match for
      her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He is poor!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But his father and elder brothers are made much of at Court-none so
      constantly at the palace as they; and with her fortune, who knows? He may
      be able to get a barony.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I believe you are in love with en yourself!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How can you insult me so, Thomas! And is it not monstrous for you to talk
      of my wickedness when you have a like scheme in your own head? You know
      you have. Some bumpkin of your own choosing-some petty gentleman who lives
      down at that outlandish place of yours, Falls-Park-one of your
      pot-companions' sons-'
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an outburst of imprecation on the part of her husband in lieu of
      further argument. As soon as he could utter a connected sentence he said:
      'You crow and you domineer, mistress, because you are heiress- general
      here. You are in your own house; you are on your own land. But let me tell
      'ee that if I did come here to you instead of taking you to me, it was
      done at the dictates of convenience merely. H&mdash;-! I'm no beggar!
      Ha'n't I a place of my own? Ha'n't I an avenue as long as thine? Ha'n't I
      beeches that will more than match thy oaks? I should have lived in my own
      quiet house and land, contented, if you had not called me off with your
      airs and graces. Faith, I'll go back there; I'll not stay with thee
      longer! If it had not been for our Betty I should have gone long ago!'
    </p>
    <p>
      After this there were no more words; but presently, hearing the sound of a
      door opening and shutting below, the girl again looked from the window.
      Footsteps crunched on the gravel-walk, and a shape in a drab greatcoat,
      easily distinguishable as her father, withdrew from the house. He moved to
      the left, and she watched him diminish down the long east front till he
      had turned the corner and vanished. He must have gone round to the
      stables.
    </p>
    <p>
      She closed the window and shrank into bed, where she cried herself to
      sleep. This child, their only one, Betty, beloved ambitiously by her
      mother, and with uncalculating passionateness by her father, was
      frequently made wretched by such episodes as this; though she was too
      young to care very deeply, for her own sake, whether her mother betrothed
      her to the gentleman discussed or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Squire had often gone out of the house in this manner, declaring that
      he would never return, but he had always reappeared in the morning. The
      present occasion, however, was different in the issue: next day she was
      told that her father had ridden to his estate at Falls-Park early in the
      morning on business with his agent, and might not come back for some days.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Falls-Park was over twenty miles from King's-Hintock Court, and was
      altogether a more modest centre-piece to a more modest possession than the
      latter. But as Squire Dornell came in view of it that February morning, he
      thought that he had been a fool ever to leave it, though it was for the
      sake of the greatest heiress in Wessex. Its classic front, of the period
      of the second Charles, derived from its regular features a dignity which
      the great, battlemented, heterogeneous mansion of his wife could not
      eclipse. Altogether he was sick at heart, and the gloom which the
      densely-timbered park threw over the scene did not tend to remove the
      depression of this rubicund man of eight-and-forty, who sat so heavily
      upon his gelding. The child, his darling Betty: there lay the root of his
      trouble. He was unhappy when near his wife, he was unhappy when away from
      his little girl; and from this dilemma there was no practicable escape. As
      a consequence he indulged rather freely in the pleasures of the table,
      became what was called a three bottle man, and, in his wife's estimation,
      less and less presentable to her polite friends from town.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was received by the two or three old servants who were in charge of the
      lonely place, where a few rooms only were kept habitable for his use or
      that of his friends when hunting; and during the morning he was made more
      comfortable by the arrival of his faithful servant Tupcombe from
      King's-Hintock. But after a day or two spent here in solitude he began to
      feel that he had made a mistake in coming. By leaving King's-Hintock in
      his anger he had thrown away his best opportunity of counteracting his
      wife's preposterous notion of promising his poor little Betty's hand to a
      man she had hardly seen. To protect her from such a repugnant bargain he
      should have remained on the spot. He felt it almost as a misfortune that
      the child would inherit so much wealth. She would be a mark for all the
      adventurers in the kingdom. Had she been only the heiress to his own
      unassuming little place at Falls, how much better would have been her
      chances of happiness!
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife had divined truly when she insinuated that he himself had a lover
      in view for this pet child. The son of a dear deceased friend of his, who
      lived not two miles from where the Squire now was, a lad a couple of years
      his daughter's senior, seemed in her father's opinion the one person in
      the world likely to make her happy. But as to breathing such a scheme to
      either of the young people with the indecent haste that his wife had
      shown, he would not dream of it; years hence would be soon enough for
      that. They had already seen each other, and the Squire fancied that he
      noticed a tenderness on the youth's part which promised well. He was
      strongly tempted to profit by his wife's example, and forestall her
      match-making by throwing the two young people together there at Falls. The
      girl, though marriageable in the views of those days, was too young to be
      in love, but the lad was fifteen, and already felt an interest in her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still better than keeping watch over her at King's Hintock, where she was
      necessarily much under her mother's influence, would it be to get the
      child to stay with him at Falls for a time, under his exclusive control.
      But how accomplish this without using main force? The only possible chance
      was that his wife might, for appearance' sake, as she had done before,
      consent to Betty paying him a day's visit, when he might find means of
      detaining her till Reynard, the suitor whom his wife favoured, had gone
      abroad, which he was expected to do the following week. Squire Dornell
      determined to return to King's-Hintock and attempt the enterprise. If he
      were refused, it was almost in him to pick up Betty bodily and carry her
      off.
    </p>
    <p>
      The journey back, vague and Quixotic as were his intentions, was performed
      with a far lighter heart than his setting forth. He would see Betty, and
      talk to her, come what might of his plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he rode along the dead level which stretches between the hills skirting
      Falls-Park and those bounding the town of Ivell, trotted through that
      borough, and out by the King's-Hintock highway, till, passing the villages
      he entered the mile-long drive through the park to the Court. The drive
      being open, without an avenue, the Squire could discern the north front
      and door of the Court a long way off, and was himself visible from the
      windows on that side; for which reason he hoped that Betty might perceive
      him coming, as she sometimes did on his return from an outing, and run to
      the door or wave her handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was no sign. He inquired for his wife as soon as he set foot to
      earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mistress is away. She was called to London, sir.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And Mistress Betty?' said the Squire blankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Gone likewise, sir, for a little change. Mistress has left a letter for
      you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The note explained nothing, merely stating that she had posted to London
      on her own affairs, and had taken the child to give her a holiday. On the
      fly-leaf were some words from Betty herself to the same effect, evidently
      written in a state of high jubilation at the idea of her jaunt. Squire
      Dornell murmured a few expletives, and submitted to his disappointment.
      How long his wife meant to stay in town she did not say; but on
      investigation he found that the carriage had been packed with sufficient
      luggage for a sojourn of two or three weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      King's-Hintock Court was in consequence as gloomy as Falls-Park had been.
      He had lost all zest for hunting of late, and had hardly attended a meet
      that season. Dornell read and re-read Betty's scrawl, and hunted up some
      other such notes of hers to look over, this seeming to be the only
      pleasure there was left for him. That they were really in London he learnt
      in a few days by another letter from Mrs. Dornell, in which she explained
      that they hoped to be home in about a week, and that she had had no idea
      he was coming back to King's-Hintock so soon, or she would not have gone
      away without telling him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Squire Dornell wondered if, in going or returning, it had been her plan to
      call at the Reynards' place near Melchester, through which city their
      journey lay. It was possible that she might do this in furtherance of her
      project, and the sense that his own might become the losing game was
      harassing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not know how to dispose of himself, till it occurred to him that,
      to get rid of his intolerable heaviness, he would invite some friends to
      dinner and drown his cares in grog and wine. No sooner was the carouse
      decided upon than he put it in hand; those invited being mostly
      neighbouring landholders, all smaller men than himself, members of the
      hunt; also the doctor from Evershead, and the like-some of them rollicking
      blades whose presence his wife would not have countenanced had she been at
      home. 'When the cat's away-!' said the Squire.
    </p>
    <p>
      They arrived, and there were indications in their manner that they meant
      to make a night of it. Baxby of Sherton Castle was late, and they waited a
      quarter of an hour for him, he being one of the liveliest of Dornell's
      friends; without whose presence no such dinner as this would be considered
      complete, and, it may be added, with whose presence no dinner which
      included both sexes could be conducted with strict propriety. He had just
      returned from London, and the Squire was anxious to talk to him-for no
      definite reason; but he had lately breathed the atmosphere in which Betty
      was.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length they heard Baxby driving up to the door, whereupon the host and
      the rest of his guests crossed over to the dining-room. In a moment Baxby
      came hastily in at their heels, apologizing for his lateness.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I only came back last night, you know,' he said; 'and the truth o't is, I
      had as much as I could carry.' He turned to the Squire. 'Well, Dornell-so
      cunning Reynard has stolen your little ewe lamb? Ha, ha!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What?' said Squire Dornell vacantly, across the dining-table, round which
      they were all standing, the cold March sunlight streaming in upon his
      full-clean shaven face.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Surely th'st know what all the town knows?-you've had a letter by this
      time?-that Stephen Reynard has married your Betty? Yes, as I'm a living
      man. It was a carefully-arranged thing: they parted at once, and are not
      to meet for five or six years. But, Lord, you must know!'
    </p>
    <p>
      A thud on the floor was the only reply of the Squire. They quickly turned.
      He had fallen down like a log behind the table, and lay motionless on the
      oak boards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those at hand hastily bent over him, and the whole group were in
      confusion. They found him to be quite unconscious, though puffing and
      panting like a blacksmith's bellows. His face was livid, his veins
      swollen, and beads of perspiration stood upon his brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What's happened to him?' said several.
    </p>
    <p>
      'An apoplectic fit,' said the doctor from Evershead, gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was only called in at the Court for small ailments, as a rule, and felt
      the importance of the situation. He lifted the Squire's head, loosened his
      cravat and clothing, and rang for the servants, who took the Squire
      upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      There he lay as if in a drugged sleep. The surgeon drew a basin-full of
      blood from him, but it was nearly six o'clock before he came to himself.
      The dinner was completely disorganized, and some had gone home long ago;
      but two or three remained.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Bless my soul,' Baxby kept repeating, 'I didn't know things had come to
      this pass between Dornell and his lady! I thought the feast he was
      spreading to-day was in honour of the event, though privately kept for the
      present! His little maid married without his knowledge!'
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the Squire recovered consciousness he gasped: ''Tis abduction!
      'Tis a capital felony! He can be hung! Where is Baxby? I am very well now.
      What items have ye heard, Baxby?'
    </p>
    <p>
      The bearer of the untoward news was extremely unwilling to agitate Dornell
      further, and would say little more at first. But an hour after, when the
      Squire had partially recovered and was sitting up, Baxby told as much as
      he knew, the most important particular being that Betty's mother was
      present at the marriage, and showed every mark of approval. 'Everything
      appeared to have been done so regularly that I, of course, thought you
      knew all about it,' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I knew no more than the underground dead that such a step was in the
      wind! A child not yet thirteen! How Sue hath outwitted me! Did Reynard go
      up to Lon'on with 'em, d'ye know?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I can't say. All I know is that your lady and daughter were walking along
      the street, with the footman behind 'em; that they entered a jeweller's
      shop, where Reynard was standing; and that there, in the presence o' the
      shopkeeper and your man, who was called in on purpose, your Betty said to
      Reynard-so the story goes: 'pon my soul I don't vouch for the truth of
      it-she said, "Will you marry me?" or, "I want to marry you: will you have
      me-now or never?" she said.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What she said means nothing,' murmured the Squire, with wet eyes. 'Her
      mother put the words into her mouth to avoid the serious consequences that
      would attach to any suspicion of force. The words be not the child's: she
      didn't dream of marriage-how should she, poor little maid! Go on.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, be that as it will, they were all agreed apparently. They bought
      the ring on the spot, and the marriage took place at the nearest church
      within half-an-hour.'
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      A day or two later there came a letter from Mrs. Dornell to her husband,
      written before she knew of his stroke. She related the circumstances of
      the marriage in the gentlest manner, and gave cogent reasons and excuses
      for consenting to the premature union, which was now an accomplished fact
      indeed. She had no idea, till sudden pressure was put upon her, that the
      contract was expected to be carried out so soon, but being taken half
      unawares, she had consented, having learned that Stephen Reynard, now
      their son-in-law, was becoming a great favourite at Court, and that he
      would in all likelihood have a title granted him before long. No harm
      could come to their dear daughter by this early marriage- contract, seeing
      that her life would be continued under their own eyes, exactly as before,
      for some years. In fine, she had felt that no other such fair opportunity
      for a good marriage with a shrewd courtier and wise man of the world, who
      was at the same time noted for his excellent personal qualities, was
      within the range of probability, owing to the rusticated lives they led at
      King's-Hintock. Hence she had yielded to Stephen's solicitation, and hoped
      her husband would forgive her. She wrote, in short, like a woman who,
      having had her way as to the deed, is prepared to make any concession as
      to words and subsequent behaviour.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this Dornell took at its true value, or rather, perhaps, at less than
      its true value. As his life depended upon his not getting into a passion,
      he controlled his perturbed emotions as well as he was able, going about
      the house sadly and utterly unlike his former self. He took every
      precaution to prevent his wife knowing of the incidents of his sudden
      illness, from a sense of shame at having a heart so tender; a ridiculous
      quality, no doubt, in her eyes, now that she had become so imbued with
      town ideas. But rumours of his seizure somehow reached her, and she let
      him know that she was about to return to nurse him. He thereupon packed up
      and went off to his own place at Falls-Park.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here he lived the life of a recluse for some time. He was still too unwell
      to entertain company, or to ride to hounds or elsewhither; but more than
      this, his aversion to the faces of strangers and acquaintances, who knew
      by that time of the trick his wife had played him, operated to hold him
      aloof.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing could influence him to censure Betty for her share in the exploit.
      He never once believed that she had acted voluntarily. Anxious to know how
      she was getting on, he despatched the trusty servant Tupcombe to Evershead
      village, close to King's-Hintock, timing his journey so that he should
      reach the place under cover of dark. The emissary arrived without notice,
      being out of livery, and took a seat in the chimney-corner of the
      Sow-and-Acorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation of the droppers-in was always of the nine days'
      wonder-the recent marriage. The smoking listener learnt that Mrs. Dornell
      and the girl had returned to King's-Hintock for a day or two, that Reynard
      had set out for the Continent, and that Betty had since been packed off to
      school. She did not realize her position as Reynard's child-wife-so the
      story went-and though somewhat awe-stricken at first by the ceremony, she
      had soon recovered her spirits on finding that her freedom was in no way
      to be interfered with.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that, formal messages began to pass between Dornell and his wife,
      the latter being now as persistently conciliating as she was formerly
      masterful. But her rustic, simple, blustering husband still held
      personally aloof. Her wish to be reconciled-to win his forgiveness for her
      stratagem-moreover, a genuine tenderness and desire to soothe his sorrow,
      which welled up in her at times, brought her at last to his door at
      Falls-Park one day.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had not met since that night of altercation, before her departure for
      London and his subsequent illness. She was shocked at the change in him.
      His face had become expressionless, as blank as that of a puppet, and what
      troubled her still more was that she found him living in one room, and
      indulging freely in stimulants, in absolute disobedience to the
      physician's order. The fact was obvious that he could no longer be allowed
      to live thus uncouthly.
    </p>
    <p>
      So she sympathized, and begged his pardon, and coaxed. But though after
      this date there was no longer such a complete estrangement as before, they
      only occasionally saw each other, Dornell for the most part making Falls
      his headquarters still.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three or four years passed thus. Then she came one day, with more
      animation in her manner, and at once moved him by the simple statement
      that Betty's schooling had ended; she had returned, and was grieved
      because he was away. She had sent a message to him in these words: 'Ask
      father to come home to his dear Betty.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah! Then she is very unhappy!' said Squire Dornell.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      ''Tis that accursed marriage!' continued the Squire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still his wife would not dispute with him. 'She is outside in the
      carriage,' said Mrs. Dornell gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What-Betty?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why didn't you tell me?' Dornell rushed out, and there was the girl
      awaiting his forgiveness, for she supposed herself, no less than her
      mother, to be under his displeasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, Betty had left school, and had returned to King's-Hintock. She was
      nearly seventeen, and had developed to quite a young woman. She looked not
      less a member of the household for her early marriage-contract, which she
      seemed, indeed, to have almost forgotten. It was like a dream to her; that
      clear cold March day, the London church, with its gorgeous pews, and
      green-baize linings, and the great organ in the west gallery-so different
      from their own little church in the shrubbery of King's-Hintock Court-the
      man of thirty, to whose face she had looked up with so much awe, and with
      a sense that he was rather ugly and formidable; the man whom, though they
      corresponded politely, she had never seen since; one to whose existence
      she was now so indifferent that if informed of his death, and that she
      would never see him more, she would merely have replied, 'Indeed!' Betty's
      passions as yet still slept.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hast heard from thy husband lately?' said Squire Dornell, when they were
      indoors, with an ironical laugh of fondness which demanded no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl winced, and he noticed that his wife looked appealingly at him.
      As the conversation went on, and there were signs that Dornell would
      express sentiments that might do harm to a position which they could not
      alter, Mrs. Dornell suggested that Betty should leave the room till her
      father and herself had finished their private conversation; and this Betty
      obediently did.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dornell renewed his animadversions freely. 'Did you see how the sound of
      his name frightened her?' he presently added. 'If you didn't, I did.
      Zounds! what a future is in store for that poor little unfortunate wench
      o' mine! I tell 'ee, Sue, 'twas not a marriage at all, in morality, and if
      I were a woman in such a position, I shouldn't feel it as one. She might,
      without a sign of sin, love a man of her choice as well now as if she were
      chained up to no other at all. There, that's my mind, and I can't help it.
      Ah, Sue, my man was best! He'd ha' suited her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't believe it,' she replied incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You should see him; then you would. He's growing up a fine fellow, I can
      tell 'ee.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hush! not so loud!' she answered, rising from her seat and going to the
      door of the next room, whither her daughter had betaken herself. To Mrs.
      Dornell's alarm, there sat Betty in a reverie, her round eyes fixed on
      vacancy, musing so deeply that she did not perceive her mother's entrance.
      She had heard every word, and was digesting the new knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mother felt that Falls-Park was dangerous ground for a young girl of
      the susceptible age, and in Betty's peculiar position, while Dornell
      talked and reasoned thus. She called Betty to her, and they took leave.
      The Squire would not clearly promise to return and make King's-Hintock
      Court his permanent abode; but Betty's presence there, as at former times,
      was sufficient to make him agree to pay them a visit soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the way home Betty remained preoccupied and silent. It was too plain
      to her anxious mother that Squire Dornell's free views had been a sort of
      awakening to the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interval before Dornell redeemed his pledge to come and see them was
      unexpectedly short. He arrived one morning about twelve o'clock, driving
      his own pair of black-bays in the curricle-phaeton with yellow panels and
      red wheels, just as he had used to do, and his faithful old Tupcombe on
      horseback behind. A young man sat beside the Squire in the carriage, and
      Mrs. Dornell's consternation could scarcely be concealed when, abruptly
      entering with his companion, the Squire announced him as his friend
      Phelipson of Elm-Cranlynch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dornell passed on to Betty in the background and tenderly kissed her.
      'Sting your mother's conscience, my maid!' he whispered. 'Sting her
      conscience by pretending you are struck with Phelipson, and would ha'
      loved him, as your old father's choice, much more than him she has forced
      upon 'ee.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The simple-souled speaker fondly imagined that it as entirely in obedience
      to this direction that Betty's eyes stole interested glances at the frank
      and impulsive Phelipson that day at dinner, and he laughed grimly within
      himself to see how this joke of his, as he imagined it to be, was
      disturbing the peace of mind of the lady of the house. 'Now Sue sees what
      a mistake she has made!' said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Dornell was verily greatly alarmed, and as soon as she could speak a
      word with him alone she upbraided him. 'You ought not to have brought him
      here. Oh Thomas, how could you be so thoughtless! Lord, don't you see,
      dear, that what is done cannot be undone, and how all this foolery
      jeopardizes her happiness with her husband? Until you interfered, and
      spoke in her hearing about this Phelipson, she was as patient and as
      willing as a lamb, and looked forward to Mr. Reynard's return with real
      pleasure. Since her visit to Falls-Park she has been monstrous close-
      mouthed and busy with her own thoughts. What mischief will you do? How
      will it end?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Own, then, that my man was best suited to her. I only brought him to
      convince you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, yes; I do admit it. But oh! do take him back again at once! Don't
      keep him here! I fear she is even attracted by him already.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nonsense, Sue. 'Tis only a little trick to tease 'ee!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless her motherly eye was not so likely to be deceived as his, and
      if Betty were really only playing at being love-struck that day, she
      played at it with the perfection of a Rosalind, and would have deceived
      the best professors into a belief that it was no counterfeit. The Squire,
      having obtained his victory, was quite ready to take back the too
      attractive youth, and early in the afternoon they set out on their return
      journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      A silent figure who rode behind them was as interested as Dornell in that
      day's experiment. It was the staunch Tupcombe, who, with his eyes on the
      Squire's and young Phelipson's backs, thought how well the latter would
      have suited Betty, and how greatly the former had changed for the worse
      during these last two or three years. He cursed his mistress as the cause
      of the change.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this memorable visit to prove his point, the lives of the Dornell
      couple flowed on quietly enough for the space of a twelvemonth, the Squire
      for the most part remaining at Falls, and Betty passing and repassing
      between them now and then, once or twice alarming her mother by not
      driving home from her father's house till midnight.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The repose of King's-Hintock was broken by the arrival of a special
      messenger. Squire Dornell had had an access of gout so violent as to be
      serious. He wished to see Betty again: why had she not come for so long?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Dornell was extremely reluctant to take Betty in that direction too
      frequently; but the girl was so anxious to go, her interests latterly
      seeming to be so entirely bound up in Falls-Park and its neighbourhood,
      that there was nothing to be done but to let her set out and accompany
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Squire Dornell had been impatiently awaiting her arrival. They found him
      very ill and irritable. It had been his habit to take powerful medicines
      to drive away his enemy, and they had failed in their effect on this
      occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The presence of his daughter, as usual, calmed him much, even while, as
      usual too, it saddened him; for he could never forget that she had
      disposed of herself for life in opposition to his wishes, though she had
      secretly assured him that she would never have consented had she been as
      old as she was now.
    </p>
    <p>
      As on a former occasion, his wife wished to speak to him alone about the
      girl's future, the time now drawing nigh at which Reynard was expected to
      come and claim her. He would have done so already, but he had been put off
      by the earnest request of the young woman herself, which accorded with
      that of her parents, on the score of her youth. Reynard had deferentially
      submitted to their wishes in this respect, the understanding between them
      having been that he would not visit her before she was eighteen, except by
      the mutual consent of all parties. But this could not go on much longer,
      and there was no doubt, from the tenor of his last letter, that he would
      soon take possession of her whether or no.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be out of the sound of this delicate discussion Betty was accordingly
      sent downstairs, and they soon saw her walking away into the shrubberies,
      looking very pretty in her sweeping green gown, and flapping broad-brimmed
      hat overhung with a feather.
    </p>
    <p>
      On returning to the subject, Mrs. Dornell found her husband's reluctance
      to reply in the affirmative to Reynard's letter to be as great as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      'She is three months short of eighteen!' he exclaimed. ''Tis too soon. I
      won't hear of it! If I have to keep him off sword in hand, he shall not
      have her yet.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But, my dear Thomas,' she expostulated, 'consider if anything should
      happen to you or to me, how much better it would be that she should be
      settled in her home with him!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I say it is too soon!' he argued, the veins of his forehead beginning to
      swell. 'If he gets her this side o' Candlemas I'll challenge en-I'll take
      my oath on't! I'll be back to King's-Hintock in two or three days, and
      I'll not lose sight of her day or night!'
    </p>
    <p>
      She feared to agitate him further, and gave way, assuring him, in
      obedience to his demand, that if Reynard should write again before he got
      back, to fix a time for joining Betty, she would put the letter in her
      husband's hands, and he should do as he chose. This was all that required
      discussion privately, and Mrs. Dornell went to call in Betty, hoping that
      she had not heard her father's loud tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had certainly not done so this time. Mrs. Dornell followed the path
      along which she had seen Betty wandering, but went a considerable distance
      without perceiving anything of her. The Squire's wife then turned round to
      proceed to the other side of the house by a short cut across the grass,
      when, to her surprise and consternation, she beheld the object of her
      search sitting on the horizontal bough of a cedar, beside her being a
      young man, whose arm was round her waist. He moved a little, and she
      recognized him as young Phelipson.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas, then, she was right. The so-called counterfeit love was real. What
      Mrs. Dornell called her husband at that moment, for his folly in
      originally throwing the young people together, it is not necessary to
      mention. She decided in a moment not to let the lovers know that she had
      seen them. She accordingly retreated, reached the front of the house by
      another route, and called at the top of her voice from a window, 'Betty!'
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first time since her strategic marriage of the child, Susan
      Dornell doubted the wisdom of that step.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband had, as it were, been assisted by destiny to make his
      objection, originally trivial, a valid one. She saw the outlines of
      trouble in the future. Why had Dornell interfered? Why had he insisted
      upon producing his man? This, then, accounted for Betty's pleading for
      postponement whenever the subject of her husband's return was broached;
      this accounted for her attachment to Falls-Park. Possibly this very
      meeting that she had witnessed had been arranged by letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps the girl's thoughts would never have strayed for a moment if her
      father had not filled her head with ideas of repugnance to her early
      union, on the ground that she had been coerced into it before she knew her
      own mind; and she might have rushed to meet her husband with open arms on
      the appointed day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty at length appeared in the distance in answer to the call, and came
      up pale, but looking innocent of having seen a living soul. Mrs. Dornell
      groaned in spirit at such duplicity in the child of her bosom. This was
      the simple creature for whose development into womanhood they had all been
      so tenderly waiting-a forward minx, old enough not only to have a lover,
      but to conceal his existence as adroitly as any woman of the world!
      Bitterly did the Squire's lady regret that Stephen Reynard had not been
      allowed to come to claim her at the time he first proposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two sat beside each other almost in silence on their journey back to
      King's-Hintock. Such words as were spoken came mainly from Betty, and
      their formality indicated how much her mind and heart were occupied with
      other things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Dornell was far too astute a mother to openly attack Betty on the
      matter. That would be only fanning flame. The indispensable course seemed
      to her to be that of keeping the treacherous girl under lock and key till
      her husband came to take her off her mother's hands. That he would
      disregard Dornell's opposition, and come soon, was her devout wish.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed, therefore, a fortunate coincidence that on her arrival at
      King's-Hintock a letter from Reynard was put into Mrs. Dornell's hands. It
      was addressed to both her and her husband, and courteously informed them
      that the writer had landed at Bristol, and proposed to come on to
      King's-Hintock in a few days, at last to meet and carry off his darling
      Betty, if she and her parents saw no objection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty had also received a letter of the same tenor. Her mother had only to
      look at her face to see how the girl received the information. She was as
      pale as a sheet.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You must do your best to welcome him this time, my dear Betty,' her
      mother said gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But-but-I-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are a woman now,' added her mother severely, 'and these postponements
      must come to an end.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But my father-oh, I am sure he will not allow this! I am not ready. If he
      could only wait a year longer-if he could only wait a few months longer!
      Oh, I wish-I wish my dear father were here! I will send to him instantly.'
      She broke off abruptly, and falling upon her mother's neck, burst into
      tears, saying, 'O my mother, have mercy upon me-I do not love this man, my
      husband!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The agonized appeal went too straight to Mrs. Dornell's heart for her to
      hear it unmoved. Yet, things having come to this pass, what could she do?
      She was distracted, and for a moment was on Betty's side. Her original
      thought had been to write an affirmative reply to Reynard, allow him to
      come on to King's-Hintock, and keep her husband in ignorance of the whole
      proceeding till he should arrive from Falls on some fine day after his
      recovery, and find everything settled, and Reynard and Betty living
      together in harmony. But the events of the day, and her daughter's sudden
      outburst of feeling, had overthrown this intention. Betty was sure to do
      as she had threatened, and communicate instantly with her father, possibly
      attempt to fly to him. Moreover, Reynard's letter was addressed to Mr.
      Dornell and herself conjointly, and she could not in conscience keep it
      from her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will send the letter on to your father instantly,' she replied
      soothingly. 'He shall act entirely as he chooses, and you know that will
      not be in opposition to your wishes. He would ruin you rather than thwart
      you. I only hope he may be well enough to bear the agitation of this news.
      Do you agree to this?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Betty agreed, on condition that she should actually witness the
      despatch of the letter. Her mother had no objection to offer to this; but
      as soon as the horseman had cantered down the drive toward the highway,
      Mrs. Dornell's sympathy with Betty's recalcitration began to die out. The
      girl's secret affection for young Phelipson could not possibly be
      condoned. Betty might communicate with him, might even try to reach him.
      Ruin lay that way. Stephen Reynard must be speedily installed in his
      proper place by Betty's side.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat down and penned a private letter to Reynard, which threw light
      upon her plan.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      'It is Necessary that I should now tell you,' she said, 'what I have never
      Mentioned before-indeed I may have signified the Contrary-that her
      Father's Objection to your joining her has not as yet been overcome. As I
      personally Wish to delay you no longer-am indeed as anxious for your
      Arrival as you can be yourself, having the good of my Daughter at Heart-no
      course is left open to me but to assist your Cause without my Husband's
      Knowledge. He, I am sorry to say, is at present ill at Falls- Park, but I
      felt it my Duty to forward him your Letter. He will therefore be like to
      reply with a peremptory Command to you to go back again, for some Months,
      whence you came, till the Time he originally stipulated has expir'd. My
      Advice is, if you get such a Letter, to take no Notice of it, but to come
      on hither as you had proposed, letting me know the Day and Hour (after
      dark, if possible) at which we may expect you. Dear Betty is with me, and
      I warrant ye that she shall be in the House when you arrive.'
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Mrs. Dornell, having sent away this epistle unsuspected of anybody, next
      took steps to prevent her daughter leaving the Court, avoiding if possible
      to excite the girl's suspicions that she was under restraint. But, as if
      by divination, Betty had seemed to read the husband's approach in the
      aspect of her mother's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He is coming!' exclaimed the maiden.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not for a week,' her mother assured her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He is then-for certain?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty hastily retired to her room, and would not be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      To lock her up, and hand over the key to Reynard when he should appear in
      the hall, was a plan charming in its simplicity, till her mother found, on
      trying the door of the girl's chamber softly, that Betty had already
      locked and bolted it on the inside, and had given directions to have her
      meals served where she was, by leaving them on a dumb-waiter outside the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon Mrs. Dornell noiselessly sat down in her boudoir, which, as well
      as her bed-chamber, was a passage-room to the girl's apartment, and she
      resolved not to vacate her post night or day till her daughter's husband
      should appear, to which end she too arranged to breakfast, dine, and sup
      on the spot. It was impossible now that Betty should escape without her
      knowledge, even if she had wished, there being no other door to the
      chamber, except one admitting to a small inner dressing-room inaccessible
      by any second way.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was plain that the young girl had no thought of escape. Her ideas
      ran rather in the direction of intrenchment: she was prepared to stand a
      siege, but scorned flight. This, at any rate, rendered her secure. As to
      how Reynard would contrive a meeting with her coy daughter while in such a
      defensive humour, that, thought her mother, must be left to his own
      ingenuity to discover.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty had looked so wild and pale at the announcement of her husband's
      approaching visit, that Mrs. Dornell, somewhat uneasy, could not leave her
      to herself. She peeped through the keyhole an hour later. Betty lay on the
      sofa, staring listlessly at the ceiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are looking ill, child,' cried her mother. 'You've not taken the air
      lately. Come with me for a drive.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty made no objection. Soon they drove through the park towards the
      village, the daughter still in the strained, strung-up silence that had
      fallen upon her. They left the park to return by another route, and on the
      open road passed a cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty's eye fell upon the cottage-window. Within it she saw a young girl
      about her own age, whom she knew by sight, sitting in a chair and propped
      by a pillow. The girl's face was covered with scales, which glistened in
      the sun. She was a convalescent from smallpox-a disease whose prevalence
      at that period was a terror of which we at present can hardly form a
      conception.
    </p>
    <p>
      An idea suddenly energized Betty's apathetic features. She glanced at her
      mother; Mrs. Dornell had been looking in the opposite direction. Betty
      said that she wished to go back to the cottage for a moment to speak to a
      girl in whom she took an interest. Mrs. Dornell appeared suspicious, but
      observing that the cottage had no back-door, and that Betty could not
      escape without being seen, she allowed the carriage to be stopped. Betty
      ran back and entered the cottage, emerging again in about a minute, and
      resuming her seat in the carriage. As they drove on she fixed her eyes
      upon her mother and said, 'There, I have done it now!' Her pale face was
      stormy, and her eyes full of waiting tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What have you done?' said Mrs. Dornell.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nanny Priddle is sick of the smallpox, and I saw her at the window, and I
      went in and kissed her, so that I might take it; and now I shall have it,
      and he won't be able to come near me!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Wicked girl!' cries her mother. 'Oh, what am I to do! What-bring a
      distemper on yourself, and usurp the sacred prerogative of God, because
      you can't palate the man you've wedded!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The alarmed woman gave orders to drive home as rapidly as possible, and on
      arriving, Betty, who was by this time also somewhat frightened at her own
      enormity, was put into a bath, and fumigated, and treated in every way
      that could be thought of to ward off the dreadful malady that in a rash
      moment she had tried to acquire.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was now a double reason for isolating the rebellious daughter and
      wife in her own chamber, and there she accordingly remained for the rest
      of the day and the days that followed; till no ill results seemed likely
      to arise from her wilfulness.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Meanwhile the first letter from Reynard, announcing to Mrs. Dornell and
      her husband jointly that he was coming in a few days, had sped on its way
      to Falls-Park. It was directed under cover to Tupcombe, the confidential
      servant, with instructions not to put it into his master's hands till he
      had been refreshed by a good long sleep. Tupcombe much regretted his
      commission, letters sent in this way always disturbing the Squire; but
      guessing that it would be infinitely worse in the end to withhold the news
      than to reveal it, he chose his time, which was early the next morning,
      and delivered the missive.
    </p>
    <p>
      The utmost effect that Mrs. Dornell had anticipated from the message was a
      peremptory order from her husband to Reynard to hold aloof a few months
      longer. What the Squire really did was to declare that he would go himself
      and confront Reynard at Bristol, and have it out with him there by word of
      mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But, master,' said Tupcombe, 'you can't. You cannot get out of bed.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You leave the room, Tupcombe, and don't say "can't" before me! Have Jerry
      saddled in an hour.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The long-tried Tupcombe thought his employer demented, so utterly helpless
      was his appearance just then, and he went out reluctantly. No sooner was
      he gone than the Squire, with great difficulty, stretched himself over to
      a cabinet by the bedside, unlocked it, and took out a small bottle. It
      contained a gout specific, against whose use he had been repeatedly warned
      by his regular physician, but whose warning he now cast to the winds.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took a double dose, and waited half an hour. It seemed to produce no
      effect. He then poured out a treble dose, swallowed it, leant back upon
      his pillow, and waited. The miracle he anticipated had been worked at
      last. It seemed as though the second draught had not only operated with
      its own strength, but had kindled into power the latent forces of the
      first. He put away the bottle, and rang up Tupcombe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Less than an hour later one of the housemaids, who of course was quite
      aware that the Squire's illness was serious, was surprised to hear a bold
      and decided step descending the stairs from the direction of Mr. Dornell's
      room, accompanied by the humming of a tune. She knew that the doctor had
      not paid a visit that morning, and that it was too heavy to be the valet
      or any other man-servant. Looking up, she saw Squire Dornell fully
      dressed, descending toward her in his drab caped riding- coat and boots,
      with the swinging easy movement of his prime. Her face expressed her
      amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What the devil beest looking at?' said the Squire. 'Did you never see a
      man walk out of his house before, wench?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Resuming his humming-which was of a defiant sort-he proceeded to the
      library, rang the bell, asked if the horses were ready, and directed them
      to be brought round. Ten minutes later he rode away in the direction of
      Bristol, Tupcombe behind him, trembling at what these movements might
      portend.
    </p>
    <p>
      They rode on through the pleasant woodlands and the monotonous straight
      lanes at an equal pace. The distance traversed might have been about
      fifteen miles when Tupcombe could perceive that the Squire was getting
      tired-as weary as he would have been after riding three times the distance
      ten years before. However, they reached Bristol without any mishap, and
      put up at the Squire's accustomed inn. Dornell almost immediately
      proceeded on foot to the inn which Reynard had given as his address, it
      being now about four o'clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reynard had already dined-for people dined early then-and he was staying
      indoors. He had already received Mrs. Dornell's reply to his letter; but
      before acting upon her advice and starting for King's-Hintock he made up
      his mind to wait another day, that Betty's father might at least have time
      to write to him if so minded. The returned traveller much desired to
      obtain the Squire's assent, as well as his wife's, to the proposed visit
      to his bride, that nothing might seem harsh or forced in his method of
      taking his position as one of the family. But though he anticipated some
      sort of objection from his father-in-law, in consequence of Mrs. Dornell's
      warning, he was surprised at the announcement of the Squire in person.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stephen Reynard formed the completest of possible contrasts to Dornell as
      they stood confronting each other in the best parlour of the Bristol
      tavern. The Squire, hot-tempered, gouty, impulsive, generous, reckless;
      the younger man, pale, tall, sedate, self-possessed-a man of the world,
      fully bearing out at least one couplet in his epitaph, still extant in
      King's-Hintock church, which places in the inventory of his good qualities
    </p>
    <p>
      'Engaging Manners, cultivated Mind, Adorn'd by Letters, and in Courts
      refin'd.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He was at this time about five-and-thirty, though careful living and an
      even, unemotional temperament caused him to look much younger than his
      years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Squire Dornell plunged into his errand without much ceremony or preface.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am your humble servant, sir,' he said. 'I have read your letter writ to
      my wife and myself, and considered that the best way to answer it would be
      to do so in person.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am vastly honoured by your visit, sir,' said Mr. Stephen Reynard,
      bowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, what's done can't be undone,' said Dornell, 'though it was mighty
      early, and was no doing of mine. She's your wife; and there's an end on't.
      But in brief, sir, she's too young for you to claim yet; we mustn't reckon
      by years; we must reckon by nature. She's still a girl; 'tis onpolite of
      'ee to come yet; next year will be full soon enough for you to take her to
      you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, courteous as Reynard could be, he was a little obstinate when his
      resolution had once been formed. She had been promised him by her
      eighteenth birthday at latest-sooner if she were in robust health. Her
      mother had fixed the time on her own judgment, without a word of
      interference on his part. He had been hanging about foreign courts till he
      was weary. Betty was now as woman, if she would ever be one, and there was
      not, in his mind, the shadow of an excuse for putting him off longer.
      Therefore, fortified as he was by the support of her mother, he blandly
      but firmly told the Squire that he had been willing to waive his rights,
      out of deference to her parents, to any reasonable extent, but must now,
      in justice to himself and her insist on maintaining them. He therefore,
      since she had not come to meet him, should proceed to King's- Hintock in a
      few days to fetch her.
    </p>
    <p>
      This announcement, in spite of the urbanity with which it was delivered,
      set Dornell in a passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh dammy, sir; you talk about rights, you do, after stealing her away, a
      mere child, against my will and knowledge! If we'd begged and prayed 'ee
      to take her, you could say no more.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Upon my honour, your charge is quite baseless, sir,' said his son-in-
      law. 'You must know by this time-or if you do not, it has been a monstrous
      cruel injustice to me that I should have been allowed to remain in your
      mind with such a stain upon my character-you must know that I used no
      seductiveness or temptation of any kind. Her mother assented; she
      assented. I took them at their word. That you was really opposed to the
      marriage was not known to me till afterwards.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Dornell professed to believe not a word of it. 'You sha'n't have her till
      she's dree sixes full-no maid ought to be married till she's dree
      sixes!-and my daughter sha'n't be treated out of nater!' So he stormed on
      till Tupcombe, who had been alarmedly listening in the next room, entered
      suddenly, declaring to Reynard that his master's life was in danger if the
      interview were prolonged, he being subject to apoplectic strokes at these
      crises. Reynard immediately said that he would be the last to wish to
      injure Squire Dornell, and left the room, and as soon as the Squire had
      recovered breath and equanimity, he went out of the inn, leaning on the
      arm of Tupcombe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tupcombe was for sleeping in Bristol that night, but Dornell, whose energy
      seemed as invincible as it was sudden, insisted upon mounting and getting
      back as far as Falls-Park, to continue the journey to King's- Hintock on
      the following day. At five they started, and took the southern road toward
      the Mendip Hills. The evening was dry and windy, and, excepting that the
      sun did not shine, strongly reminded Tupcombe of the evening of that March
      month, nearly five years earlier, when news had been brought to
      King's-Hintock Court of the child Betty's marriage in London-news which
      had produced upon Dornell such a marked effect for the worse ever since,
      and indirectly upon the household of which he was the head. Before that
      time the winters were lively at Falls-Park, as well as at King's-Hintock,
      although the Squire had ceased to make it his regular residence.
      Hunting-guests and shooting-guests came and went, and open house was kept.
      Tupcombe disliked the clever courtier who had put a stop to this by taking
      away from the Squire the only treasure he valued.
    </p>
    <p>
      It grew darker with their progress along the lanes, and Tupcombe
      discovered from Mr. Dornell's manner of riding that his strength was
      giving way; and spurring his own horse close alongside, he asked him how
      he felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, bad; damn bad, Tupcombe! I can hardly keep my seat. I shall never be
      any better, I fear! Have we passed Three-Man-Gibbet yet?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not yet by a long ways, sir.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I wish we had. I can hardly hold on.' The Squire could not repress a
      groan now and then, and Tupcombe knew he was in great pain. 'I wish I was
      underground-that's the place for such fools as I! I'd gladly be there if
      it were not for Mistress Betty. He's coming on to King's- Hintock
      to-morrow-he won't put it off any longer; he'll set out and reach there
      to-morrow night, without stopping at Falls; and he'll take her unawares,
      and I want to be there before him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I hope you may be well enough to do it, sir. But really-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I must, Tupcombe! You don't know what my trouble is; it is not so much
      that she is married to this man without my agreeing-for, after all,
      there's nothing to say against him, so far as I know; but that she don't
      take to him at all, seems to fear him-in fact, cares nothing about him;
      and if he comes forcing himself into the house upon her, why, 'twill be
      rank cruelty. Would to the Lord something would happen to prevent him!'
    </p>
    <p>
      How they reached home that night Tupcombe hardly knew. The Squire was in
      such pain that he was obliged to recline upon his horse, and Tupcombe was
      afraid every moment lest he would fall into the road. But they did reach
      home at last, and Mr. Dornell was instantly assisted to bed.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Next morning it was obvious that he could not possibly go to King's-
      Hintock for several days at least, and there on the bed he lay, cursing
      his inability to proceed on an errand so personal and so delicate that no
      emissary could perform it. What he wished to do was to ascertain from
      Betty's own lips if her aversion to Reynard was so strong that his
      presence would be positively distasteful to her. Were that the case, he
      would have borne her away bodily on the saddle behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But all that was hindered now, and he repeated a hundred times in
      Tupcombe's hearing, and in that of the nurse and other servants, 'I wish
      to God something would happen to him!'
    </p>
    <p>
      This sentiment, reiterated by the Squire as he tossed in the agony induced
      by the powerful drugs of the day before, entered sharply into the soul of
      Tupcombe and of all who were attached to the house of Dornell, as distinct
      from the house of his wife at King's-Hintock. Tupcombe, who was an
      excitable man, was hardly less disquieted by the thought of Reynard's
      return than the Squire himself was. As the week drew on, and the afternoon
      advanced at which Reynard would in all probability be passing near Falls
      on his way to the Court, the Squire's feelings became acuter, and the
      responsive Tupcombe could hardly bear to come near him. Having left him in
      the hands of the doctor, the former went out upon the lawn, for he could
      hardly breathe in the contagion of excitement caught from the employer who
      had virtually made him his confidant. He had lived with the Dornells from
      his boyhood, had been born under the shadow of their walls; his whole life
      was annexed and welded to the life of the family in a degree which has no
      counterpart in these latter days.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was summoned indoors, and learnt that it had been decided to send for
      Mrs. Dornell: her husband was in great danger. There were two or three who
      could have acted as messenger, but Dornell wished Tupcombe to go, the
      reason showing itself when, Tupcombe being ready to start, Squire Dornell
      summoned him to his chamber and leaned down so that he could whisper in
      his ear:
    </p>
    <p>
      'Put Peggy along smart, Tupcombe, and get there before him, you
      know-before him. This is the day he fixed. He has not passed Falls
      cross-roads yet. If you can do that you will be able to get Betty to
      come-d'ye see?-after her mother has started; she'll have a reason for not
      waiting for him. Bring her by the lower road-he'll go by the upper. Your
      business is to make 'em miss each other-d'ye see?-but that's a thing I
      couldn't write down.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Five minutes after, Tupcombe was astride the horse and on his way-the way
      he had followed so many times since his master, a florid young countryman,
      had first gone wooing to King's-Hintock Court. As soon as he had crossed
      the hills in the immediate neighbourhood of the manor, the road lay over a
      plain, where it ran in long straight stretches for several miles. In the
      best of times, when all had been gay in the united houses, that part of
      the road had seemed tedious. It was gloomy in the extreme now that he
      pursued it, at night and alone, on such an errand.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rode and brooded. If the Squire were to die, he, Tupcombe, would be
      alone in the world and friendless, for he was no favourite with Mrs.
      Dornell; and to find himself baffled, after all, in what he had set his
      mind on, would probably kill the Squire. Thinking thus, Tupcombe stopped
      his horse every now and then, and listened for the coming husband. The
      time was drawing on to the moment when Reynard might be expected to pass
      along this very route. He had watched the road well during the afternoon,
      and had inquired of the tavern-keepers as he came up to each, and he was
      convinced that the premature descent of the stranger-husband upon his
      young mistress had not been made by this highway as yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides the girl's mother, Tupcombe was the only member of the household
      who suspected Betty's tender feelings towards young Phelipson, so
      unhappily generated on her return from school; and he could therefore
      imagine, even better than her fond father, what would be her emotions on
      the sudden announcement of Reynard's advent that evening at King's-
      Hintock Court.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he rode and rode, desponding and hopeful by turns. He felt assured
      that, unless in the unfortunate event of the almost immediate arrival of
      her son-in law at his own heels, Mrs. Dornell would not be able to hinder
      Betty's departure for her father's bedside.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was about nine o'clock that, having put twenty miles of country behind
      him, he turned in at the lodge-gate nearest to Ivell and King's- Hintock
      village, and pursued the long north drive-itself much like a turnpike
      road-which led thence through the park to the Court. Though there were so
      many trees in King's-Hintock park, few bordered the carriage roadway; he
      could see it stretching ahead in the pale night light like an unrolled
      deal shaving. Presently the irregular frontage of the house came in view,
      of great extent, but low, except where it rose into the outlines of a
      broad square tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Tupcombe approached he rode aside upon the grass, to make sure, if
      possible, that he was the first comer, before letting his presence be
      known. The Court was dark and sleepy, in no respect as if a bridegroom
      were about to arrive.
    </p>
    <p>
      While pausing he distinctly heard the tread of a horse upon the track
      behind him, and for a moment despaired of arriving in time: here, surely,
      was Reynard! Pulling up closer to the densest tree at hand he waited, and
      found he had retreated nothing too soon, for the second rider avoided the
      gravel also, and passed quite close to him. In the profile he recognized
      young Phelipson.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Tupcombe could think what to do, Phelipson had gone on; but not to
      the door of the house. Swerving to the left, he passed round to the east
      angle, where, as Tupcombe knew, were situated Betty's apartments.
      Dismounting, he left the horse tethered to a hanging bough, and walked on
      to the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly his eye caught sight of an object which explained the position
      immediately. It was a ladder stretching from beneath the trees, which
      there came pretty close to the house, up to a first-floor window-one which
      lighted Miss Betty's rooms. Yes, it was Betty's chamber; he knew every
      room in the house well.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young horseman who had passed him, having evidently left his steed
      somewhere under the trees also, was perceptible at the top of the ladder,
      immediately outside Betty's window. While Tupcombe watched, a cloaked
      female figure stepped timidly over the sill, and the two cautiously
      descended, one before the other, the young man's arms enclosing the young
      woman between his grasp of the ladder, so that she could not fall. As soon
      as they reached the bottom, young Phelipson quickly removed the ladder and
      hid it under the bushes. The pair disappeared; till, in a few minutes,
      Tupcombe could discern a horse emerging from a remoter part of the
      umbrage. The horse carried double, the girl being on a pillion behind her
      lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tupcombe hardly knew what to do or think; yet, though this was not exactly
      the kind of flight that had been intended, she had certainly escaped. He
      went back to his own animal, and rode round to the servants' door, where
      he delivered the letter for Mrs. Dornell. To leave a verbal message for
      Betty was now impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Court servants desired him to stay over the night, but he would not do
      so, desiring to get back to the Squire as soon as possible and tell what
      he had seen. Whether he ought not to have intercepted the young people,
      and carried off Betty himself to her father, he did not know. However, it
      was too late to think of that now, and without wetting his lips or
      swallowing a crumb, Tupcombe turned his back upon King's-Hintock Court.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not till he had advanced a considerable distance on his way
      homeward that, halting under the lantern of a roadside-inn while the horse
      was watered, there came a traveller from the opposite direction in a hired
      coach; the lantern lit the stranger's face as he passed along and dropped
      into the shade. Tupcombe exulted for the moment, though he could hardly
      have justified his exultation. The belated traveller was Reynard; and
      another had stepped in before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may now be willing to know of the fortunes of Miss Betty. Left much to
      herself through the intervening days, she had ample time to brood over her
      desperate attempt at the stratagem of infection-thwarted, apparently, by
      her mother's promptitude. In what other way to gain time she could not
      think. Thus drew on the day and the hour of the evening on which her
      husband was expected to announce himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      At some period after dark, when she could not tell, a tap at the window,
      twice and thrice repeated, became audible. It caused her to start up, for
      the only visitant in her mind was the one whose advances she had so feared
      as to risk health and life to repel them. She crept to the window, and
      heard a whisper without.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is I-Charley,' said the voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty's face fired with excitement. She had latterly begun to doubt her
      admirer's staunchness, fancying his love to be going off in mere
      attentions which neither committed him nor herself very deeply. She opened
      the window, saying in a joyous whisper, 'Oh Charley; I thought you had
      deserted me quite!'
    </p>
    <p>
      He assured her he had not done that, and that he had a horse in waiting,
      if she would ride off with him. 'You must come quickly,' he said; 'for
      Reynard's on the way!'
    </p>
    <p>
      To throw a cloak round herself was the work of a moment, and assuring
      herself that her door was locked against a surprise, she climbed over the
      window-sill and descended with him as we have seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mother meanwhile, having received Tupcombe's note, found the news of
      her husband's illness so serious, as to displace her thoughts of the
      coming son-in-law, and she hastened to tell her daughter of the Squire's
      dangerous condition, thinking it might be desirable to take her to her
      father's bedside. On trying the door of the girl's room, she found it
      still locked. Mrs. Dornell called, but there was no answer. Full of
      misgivings, she privately fetched the old house-steward and bade him burst
      open the door-an order by no means easy to execute, the joinery of the
      Court being massively constructed. However, the lock sprang open at last,
      and she entered Betty's chamber only to find the window unfastened and the
      bird flown.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Mrs. Dornell was staggered. Then it occurred to her that
      Betty might have privately obtained from Tupcombe the news of her father's
      serious illness, and, fearing she might be kept back to meet her husband,
      have gone off with that obstinate and biassed servitor to Falls-Park. The
      more she thought it over the more probable did the supposition appear; and
      binding her own head-man to secrecy as to Betty's movements, whether as
      she conjectured, or otherwise, Mrs. Dornell herself prepared to set out.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had no suspicion how seriously her husband's malady had been
      aggravated by his ride to Bristol, and thought more of Betty's affairs
      than of her own. That Betty's husband should arrive by some other road
      to-night, and find neither wife nor mother-in-law to receive him, and no
      explanation of their absence, was possible; but never forgetting chances,
      Mrs. Dornell as she journeyed kept her eyes fixed upon the highway on the
      off-side, where, before she had reached the town of Ivell, the hired coach
      containing Stephen Reynard flashed into the lamplight of her own carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Dornell's coachman pulled up, in obedience to a direction she had
      given him at starting; the other coach was hailed, a few words passed, and
      Reynard alighted and came to Mrs. Dornell's carriage-window.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Come inside,' says she. 'I want to speak privately to you. Why are you so
      late?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'One hindrance and another,' says he. 'I meant to be at the Court by eight
      at latest. My gratitude for your letter. I hope-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You must not try to see Betty yet,' said she. 'There be far other and
      newer reasons against your seeing her now than there were when I wrote.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The circumstances were such that Mrs. Dornell could not possibly conceal
      them entirely; nothing short of knowing some of the facts would prevent
      his blindly acting in a manner which might be fatal to the future.
      Moreover, there are times when deeper intriguers than Mrs. Dornell feel
      that they must let out a few truths, if only in self-indulgence. So she
      told so much of recent surprises as that Betty's heart had been attracted
      by another image than his, and that his insisting on visiting her now
      might drive the girl to desperation. 'Betty has, in fact, rushed off to
      her father to avoid you,' she said. 'But if you wait she will soon forget
      this young man, and you will have nothing to fear.'
    </p>
    <p>
      As a woman and a mother she could go no further, and Betty's desperate
      attempt to infect herself the week before as a means of repelling him,
      together with the alarming possibility that, after all, she had not gone
      to her father but to her lover, was not revealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well,' sighed the diplomatist, in a tone unexpectedly quiet, 'such things
      have been known before. After all, she may prefer me to him some day, when
      she reflects how very differently I might have acted than I am going to
      act towards her. But I'll say no more about that now. I can have a bed at
      your house for to-night?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'To-night, certainly. And you leave to-morrow morning early?' She spoke
      anxiously, for on no account did she wish him to make further discoveries.
      'My husband is so seriously ill,' she continued, 'that my absence and
      Betty's on your arrival is naturally accounted for.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He promised to leave early, and to write to her soon. 'And when I think
      the time is ripe,' he said, 'I'll write to her. I may have something to
      tell her that will bring her to graciousness.'
    </p>
    <p>
      It was about one o'clock in the morning when Mrs. Dornell reached Falls-
      Park. A double blow awaited her there. Betty had not arrived; her flight
      had been elsewhither; and her stricken mother divined with whom. She
      ascended to the bedside of her husband, where to her concern she found
      that the physician had given up all hope. The Squire was sinking, and his
      extreme weakness had almost changed his character, except in the
      particular that his old obstinacy sustained him in a refusal to see a
      clergyman. He shed tears at the least word, and sobbed at the sight of his
      wife. He asked for Betty, and it was with a heavy heart that Mrs. Dornell
      told him that the girl had not accompanied her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He is not keeping her away?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, no. He is going back-he is not coming to her for some time.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then what is detaining her-cruel, neglectful maid!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, no, Thomas; she is- She could not come.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How's that?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Somehow the solemnity of these last moments of his gave him inquisitorial
      power, and the too cold wife could not conceal from him the flight which
      had taken place from King's-Hintock that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      To her amazement, the effect upon him was electrical.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What-Betty-a trump after all? Hurrah! She's her father's own maid! She's
      game! She knew he was her father's own choice! She vowed that my man
      should win! Well done, Bet!-haw! haw! Hurrah!'
    </p>
    <p>
      He had raised himself in bed by starts as he spoke, and now fell back
      exhausted. He never uttered another word, and died before the dawn. People
      said there had not been such an ungenteel death in a good county family
      for years.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Now I will go back to the time of Betty's riding off on the pillion behind
      her lover. They left the park by an obscure gate to the east, and
      presently found themselves in the lonely and solitary length of the old
      Roman road now called Long-Ash Lane.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time they were rather alarmed at their own performance, for they
      were both young and inexperienced. Hence they proceeded almost in silence
      till they came to a mean roadside inn which was not yet closed; when
      Betty, who had held on to him with much misgiving all this while, felt
      dreadfully unwell, and said she thought she would like to get down.
    </p>
    <p>
      They accordingly dismounted from the jaded animal that had brought them,
      and were shown into a small dark parlour, where they stood side by side
      awkwardly, like the fugitives they were. A light was brought, and when
      they were left alone Betty threw off the cloak which had enveloped her. No
      sooner did young Phelipson see her face than he uttered an alarmed
      exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, Lord, Lord, you are sickening for the small-pox!' he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh-I forgot!' faltered Betty. And then she informed him that, on hearing
      of her husband's approach the week before, in a desperate attempt to keep
      him from her side, she had tried to imbibe the infection-an act which till
      this moment she had supposed to have been ineffectual, imagining her
      feverishness to be the result of her excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effect of this discovery upon young Phelipson was overwhelming.
      Better-seasoned men than he would not have been proof against it, and he
      was only a little over her own age. 'And you've been holding on to me!' he
      said. 'And suppose you get worse, and we both have it, what shall we do?
      Won't you be a fright in a month or two, poor, poor Betty!'
    </p>
    <p>
      In his horror he attempted to laugh, but the laugh ended in a weakly
      giggle. She was more woman than girl by this time, and realized his
      feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What-in trying to keep off him, I keep off you?' she said miserably. 'Do
      you hate me because I am going to be ugly and ill?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh-no, no!' he said soothingly. 'But I-I am thinking if it is quite right
      for us to do this. You see, dear Betty, if you was not married it would be
      different. You are not in honour married to him we've often said; still
      you are his by law, and you can't be mine whilst he's alive. And with this
      terrible sickness coming on, perhaps you had better let me take you back,
      and-climb in at the window again.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is this your love?' said Betty reproachfully. 'Oh, if you was sickening
      for the plague itself, and going to be as ugly as the Ooser in the
      church-vestry, I wouldn't-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, no, you mistake, upon my soul!'
    </p>
    <p>
      But Betty with a swollen heart had rewrapped herself and gone out of the
      door. The horse was still standing there. She mounted by the help of the
      upping-stock, and when he had followed her she said, 'Do not come near me,
      Charley; but please lead the horse, so that if you've not caught anything
      already you'll not catch it going back. After all, what keeps off you may
      keep off him. Now onward.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not resist her command, and back they went by the way they had
      come, Betty shedding bitter tears at the retribution she had already
      brought upon herself; for though she had reproached Phelipson, she was
      staunch enough not to blame him in her secret heart for showing that his
      love was only skin-deep. The horse was stopped in the plantation, and they
      walked silently to the lawn, reaching the bushes wherein the ladder still
      lay.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Will you put it up for me?' she asked mournfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      He re-erected the ladder without a word; but when she approached to ascend
      he said, 'Good-bye, Betty!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good-bye!' said she; and involuntarily turned her face towards his. He
      hung back from imprinting the expected kiss: at which Betty started as if
      she had received a poignant wound. She moved away so suddenly that he
      hardly had time to follow her up the ladder to prevent her falling.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Tell your mother to get the doctor at once!' he said anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stepped in without looking behind; he descended, withdrew the ladder,
      and went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alone in her chamber, Betty flung herself upon her face on the bed, and
      burst into shaking sobs. Yet she would not admit to herself that her
      lover's conduct was unreasonable; only that her rash act of the previous
      week had been wrong. No one had heard her enter, and she was too worn out,
      in body and mind, to think or care about medical aid. In an hour or so she
      felt yet more unwell, positively ill; and nobody coming to her at the
      usual bedtime, she looked towards the door. Marks of the lock having been
      forced were visible, and this made her chary of summoning a servant. She
      opened the door cautiously and sallied forth downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the dining-parlour, as it was called, the now sick and sorry Betty was
      startled to see at that late hour not her mother, but a man sitting,
      calmly finishing his supper. There was no servant in the room. He turned,
      and she recognized her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Where's my mamma?' she demanded without preface.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Gone to your father's. Is that-' He stopped, aghast.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, sir. This spotted object is your wife! I've done it because I don't
      want you to come near me!'
    </p>
    <p>
      He was sixteen years her senior; old enough to be compassionate. 'My poor
      child, you must get to bed directly! Don't be afraid of me-I'll carry you
      upstairs, and send for a doctor instantly.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, you don't know what I am!' she cried. 'I had a lover once; but now
      he's gone! 'Twasn't I who deserted him. He has deserted me; because I am
      ill he wouldn't kiss me, though I wanted him to!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Wouldn't he? Then he was a very poor slack-twisted sort of fellow. Betty,
      I've never kissed you since you stood beside me as my little wife, twelve
      years and a half old! May I kiss you now?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Though Betty by no means desired his kisses, she had enough of the spirit
      of Cunigonde in Schiller's ballad to test his daring. 'If you have courage
      to venture, yes sir!' said she. 'But you may die for it, mind!'
    </p>
    <p>
      He came up to her and imprinted a deliberate kiss full upon her mouth,
      saying, 'May many others follow!'
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head, and hastily withdrew, though secretly pleased at his
      hardihood. The excitement had supported her for the few minutes she had
      passed in his presence, and she could hardly drag herself back to her
      room. Her husband summoned the servants, and, sending them to her
      assistance, went off himself for a doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning Reynard waited at the Court till he had learnt from the
      medical man that Betty's attack promised to be a very light one-or, as it
      was expressed, 'very fine'; and in taking his leave sent up a note to her:
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now I must be Gone. I promised your Mother I would not see You yet, and
      she may be anger'd if she finds me here. Promise to see me as Soon as you
      are well?'
    </p>
    <p>
      He was of all men then living one of the best able to cope with such an
      untimely situation as this. A contriving, sagacious, gentle-mannered man,
      a philosopher who saw that the only constant attribute of life is change,
      he held that, as long as she lives, there is nothing finite in the most
      impassioned attitude a woman may take up. In twelve months his girl-wife's
      recent infatuation might be as distasteful to her mind as it was now to
      his own. In a few years her very flesh would change-so said the
      scientific;-her spirit, so much more ephemeral, was capable of changing in
      one. Betty was his, and it became a mere question of means how to effect
      that change.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the day Mrs. Dornell, having closed her husband's eyes, returned to
      the Court. She was truly relieved to find Betty there, even though on a
      bed of sickness. The disease ran its course, and in due time Betty became
      convalescent, without having suffered deeply for her rashness, one little
      speck beneath her ear, and one beneath her chin, being all the marks she
      retained.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Squire's body was not brought back to King's-Hintock. Where he was
      born, and where he had lived before wedding his Sue, there he had wished
      to be buried. No sooner had she lost him than Mrs. Dornell, like certain
      other wives, though she had never shown any great affection for him while
      he lived, awoke suddenly to his many virtues, and zealously embraced his
      opinion about delaying Betty's union with her husband, which she had
      formerly combated strenuously. 'Poor man! how right he was, and how wrong
      was I!' Eighteen was certainly the lowest age at which Mr. Reynard should
      claim her child-nay, it was too low! Far too low!
    </p>
    <p>
      So desirous was she of honouring her lamented husband's sentiments in this
      respect, that she wrote to her son-in-law suggesting that, partly on
      account of Betty's sorrow for her father's loss, and out of consideration
      for his known wishes for delay, Betty should not be taken from her till
      her nineteenth birthday.
    </p>
    <p>
      However much or little Stephen Reynard might have been to blame in his
      marriage, the patient man now almost deserved to be pitied. First Betty's
      skittishness; now her mother's remorseful volte-face: it was enough to
      exasperate anybody; and he wrote to the widow in a tone which led to a
      little coolness between those hitherto firm friends. However, knowing that
      he had a wife not to claim but to win, and that young Phelipson had been
      packed off to sea by his parents, Stephen was complaisant to a degree,
      returning to London, and holding quite aloof from Betty and her mother,
      who remained for the present in the country. In town he had a mild
      visitation of the distemper he had taken from Betty, and in writing to her
      he took care not to dwell upon its mildness. It was now that Betty began
      to pity him for what she had inflicted upon him by the kiss, and her
      correspondence acquired a distinct flavour of kindness thenceforward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Owing to his rebuffs, Reynard had grown to be truly in love with Betty in
      his mild, placid, durable way-in that way which perhaps, upon the whole,
      tends most generally to the woman's comfort under the institution of
      marriage, if not particularly to her ecstasy. Mrs. Dornell's exaggeration
      of her husband's wish for delay in their living together was inconvenient,
      but he would not openly infringe it. He wrote tenderly to Betty, and soon
      announced that he had a little surprise in store for her. The secret was
      that the King had been graciously pleased to inform him privately, through
      a relation, that His Majesty was about to offer him a Barony. Would she
      like the title to be Ivell? Moreover, he had reason for knowing that in a
      few years the dignity would be raised to that of an Earl, for which
      creation he thought the title of Wessex would be eminently suitable,
      considering the position of much of their property. As Lady Ivell,
      therefore, and future Countess of Wessex, he should beg leave to offer her
      his heart a third time.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not add, as he might have added, how greatly the consideration of
      the enormous estates at King's-Hintock and elsewhere which Betty would
      inherit, and her children after her, had conduced to this desirable
      honour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether the impending titles had really any effect upon Betty's regard for
      him I cannot state, for she was one of those close characters who never
      let their minds be known upon anything. That such honour was absolutely
      unexpected by her from such a quarter is, however, certain; and she could
      not deny that Stephen had shown her kindness, forbearance, even
      magnanimity; had forgiven her for an errant passion which he might with
      some reason have denounced, notwithstanding her cruel position as a child
      entrapped into marriage ere able to understand its bearings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mother, in her grief and remorse for the loveless life she had led
      with her rough, though open-hearted, husband, made now a creed of his
      merest whim; and continued to insist that, out of respect to his known
      desire, her son-in-law should not reside with Betty till the girl's father
      had been dead a year at least, at which time the girl would still be under
      nineteen. Letters must suffice for Stephen till then.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is rather long for him to wait,' Betty hesitatingly said one day.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What!' said her mother. 'From you? not to respect your dear father-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of course it is quite proper,' said Betty hastily. 'I don't gainsay it. I
      was but thinking that-that-'
    </p>
    <p>
      In the long slow months of the stipulated interval her mother tended and
      trained Betty carefully for her duties. Fully awake now to the many
      virtues of her dear departed one, she, among other acts of pious devotion
      to his memory, rebuilt the church of King's-Hintock village, and
      established valuable charities in all the villages of that name, as far as
      to Little-Hintock, several miles eastward.
    </p>
    <p>
      In superintending these works, particularly that of the church-building,
      her daughter Betty was her constant companion, and the incidents of their
      execution were doubtless not without a soothing effect upon the young
      creature's heart. She had sprung from girl to woman by a sudden bound, and
      few would have recognized in the thoughtful face of Betty now the same
      person who, the year before, had seemed to have absolutely no idea
      whatever of responsibility, moral or other. Time passed thus till the
      Squire had been nearly a year in his vault; and Mrs. Dornell was duly
      asked by letter by the patient Reynard if she were willing for him to come
      soon. He did not wish to take Betty away if her mother's sense of
      loneliness would be too great, but would willingly live at King's- Hintock
      awhile with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the widow had replied to this communication, she one day happened
      to observe Betty walking on the south terrace in the full sunlight,
      without hat or mantle, and was struck by her child's figure. Mrs. Dornell
      called her in, and said suddenly: 'Have you seen your husband since the
      time of your poor father's death?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well-yes, mamma,' says Betty, colouring.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What-against my wishes and those of your dear father! I am shocked at
      your disobedience!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But my father said eighteen, ma'am, and you made it much longer-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, of course-out of consideration for you! When have ye seen him?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well,' stammered Betty, 'in the course of his letters to me he said that
      I belonged to him, and if nobody knew that we met it would make no
      difference. And that I need not hurt your feelings by telling you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'So I went to Casterbridge that time you went to London about five months
      ago-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And met him there? When did you come back?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dear mamma, it grew very late, and he said it was safer not to go back
      till next day, as the roads were bad; and as you were away from home-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't want to hear any more! This is your respect for your father's
      memory,' groaned the widow. 'When did you meet him again?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh-not for more than a fortnight.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A fortnight! How many times have ye seen him altogether?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'm sure, mamma, I've not seen him altogether a dozen times.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A dozen! And eighteen and a half years old barely!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Twice we met by accident,' pleaded Betty. 'Once at Abbot's-Cernel, and
      another time at the Red Lion, Melchester.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O thou deceitful girl!' cried Mrs. Dornell. 'An accident took you to the
      Red Lion whilst I was staying at the White Hart! I remember-you came in at
      twelve o'clock at night and said you'd been to see the cathedral by the
      light o' the moon!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'My ever-honoured mamma, so I had! I only went to the Red Lion with him
      afterwards.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh Betty, Betty! That my child should have deceived me even in my widowed
      days!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But, my dearest mamma, you made me marry him!' says Betty with spirit,
      'and of course I've to obey him more than you now!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Dornell sighed. 'All I have to say is, that you'd better get your
      husband to join you as soon as possible,' she remarked. 'To go on playing
      the maiden like this-I'm ashamed to see you!'
    </p>
    <p>
      She wrote instantly to Stephen Reynard: 'I wash my hands of the whole
      matter as between you two; though I should advise you to openly join each
      other as soon as you can-if you wish to avoid scandal.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He came, though not till the promised title had been granted, and he could
      call Betty archly 'My Lady.'
    </p>
    <p>
      People said in after years that she and her husband were very happy.
      However that may be, they had a numerous family; and she became in due
      course first Countess of Wessex, as he had foretold.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little white frock in which she had been married to him at the tender
      age of twelve was carefully preserved among the relics at King's- Hintock
      Court, where it may still be seen by the curious-a yellowing, pathetic
      testimony to the small count taken of the happiness of an innocent child
      in the social strategy of those days, which might have led, but
      providentially did not lead, to great unhappiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Earl died Betty wrote him an epitaph, in which she described him
      as the best of husbands, fathers, and friends, and called herself his
      disconsolate widow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such is woman; or rather (not to give offence by so sweeping an
      assertion), such was Betty Dornell.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      It was at a meeting of one of the Wessex Field and Antiquarian Clubs that
      the foregoing story, partly told, partly read from a manuscript, was made
      to do duty for the regulation papers on deformed butterflies, fossil
      ox-horns, prehistoric dung-mixens, and such like, that usually occupied
      the more serious attention of the members.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Club was of an inclusive and intersocial character; to a degree,
      indeed, remarkable for the part of England in which it had its being-dear,
      delightful Wessex, whose statuesque dynasties are even now only just
      beginning to feel the shaking of the new and strange spirit without, like
      that which entered the lonely valley of Ezekiel's vision and made the dry
      bones move: where the honest squires, tradesmen, parsons, clerks, and
      people still praise the Lord with one voice for His best of all possible
      worlds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The present meeting, which was to extend over two days, had opened its
      proceedings at the museum of the town whose buildings and environs were to
      be visited by the members. Lunch had ended, and the afternoon excursion
      had been about to be undertaken, when the rain came down in an obstinate
      spatter, which revealed no sign of cessation. As the members waited they
      grew chilly, although it was only autumn, and a fire was lighted, which
      threw a cheerful shine upon the varnished skulls, urns, penates, tessera,
      costumes, coats of mail, weapons, and missals, animated the fossilized
      ichthyosaurus and iguanodon; while the dead eyes of the stuffed
      birds-those never-absent familiars in such collections, though murdered to
      extinction out of doors-flashed as they had flashed to the rising sun
      above the neighbouring moors on the fatal morning when the trigger was
      pulled which ended their little flight. It was then that the historian
      produced his manuscript, which he had prepared, he said, with a view to
      publication. His delivery of the story having concluded as aforesaid, the
      speaker expressed his hope that the constraint of the weather, and the
      paucity of more scientific papers, would excuse any inappropriateness in
      his subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several members observed that a storm-bound club could not presume to be
      selective, and they were all very much obliged to him for such a curious
      chapter from the domestic histories of the county.
    </p>
    <p>
      The President looked gloomily from the window at the descending rain, and
      broke a short silence by saying that though the Club had met, there seemed
      little probability of its being able to visit the objects of interest set
      down among the agenda.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Treasurer observed that they had at least a roof over their heads; and
      they had also a second day before them.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sentimental member, leaning back in his chair, declared that he was in
      no hurry to go out, and that nothing would please him so much as another
      county story, with or without manuscript.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel added that the subject should be a lady, like the former, to
      which a gentleman known as the Spark said 'Hear, hear!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Though these had spoken in jest, a rural dean who was present observed
      blandly that there was no lack of materials. Many, indeed, were the
      legends and traditions of gentle and noble dames, renowned in times past
      in that part of England, whose actions and passions were now, but for
      men's memories, buried under the brief inscription on a tomb or an entry
      of dates in a dry pedigree.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another member, an old surgeon, a somewhat grim though sociable personage,
      was quite of the speaker's opinion, and felt quite sure that the memory of
      the reverend gentleman must abound with such curious tales of fair dames,
      of their loves and hates, their joys and their misfortunes, their beauty
      and their fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parson, a trifle confused, retorted that their friend the surgeon, the
      son of a surgeon, seemed to him, as a man who had seen much and heard more
      during the long course of his own and his father's practice, the member of
      all others most likely to be acquainted with such lore.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bookworm, the Colonel, the historian, the Vice-president, the
      churchwarden, the two curates, the gentleman-tradesman, the sentimental
      member, the crimson maltster, the quiet gentleman, the man of family, the
      Spark, and several others, quite agreed, and begged that he would recall
      something of the kind. The old surgeon said that, though a meeting of the
      Mid-Wessex Field and Antiquarian Club was the last place at which he
      should have expected to be called upon in this way, he had no objection;
      and the parson said he would come next. The surgeon then reflected, and
      decided to relate the history of a lady named Barbara, who lived towards
      the end of the last century, apologizing for his tale as being perhaps a
      little too professional. The crimson maltster winked to the Spark at
      hearing the nature of the apology, and the surgeon began.

    <h2>
      DAME THE SECOND-BARBARA OF THE HOUSE OF GREBE
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By the Old Surgeon
    </h3>
    <p>
      It was apparently an idea, rather than a passion, that inspired Lord
      Uplandtowers' resolve to win her. Nobody ever knew when he formed it, or
      whence he got his assurance of success in the face of her manifest dislike
      of him. Possibly not until after that first important act of her life
      which I shall presently mention. His matured and cynical doggedness at the
      age of nineteen, when impulse mostly rules calculation, was remarkable,
      and might have owed its existence as much to his succession to the earldom
      and its accompanying local honours in childhood, as to the family
      character; an elevation which jerked him into maturity, so to speak,
      without his having known adolescence. He had only reached his twelfth year
      when his father, the fourth Earl, died, after a course of the Bath waters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, the family character had a great deal to do with it.
      Determination was hereditary in the bearers of that escutcheon; sometimes
      for good, sometimes for evil.
    </p>
    <p>
      The seats of the two families were about ten miles apart, the way between
      them lying along the now old, then new, turnpike-road connecting Havenpool
      and Warborne with the city of Melchester: a road which, though only a
      branch from what was known as the Great Western Highway, is probably, even
      at present, as it has been for the last hundred years, one of the finest
      examples of a macadamized turnpike-track that can be found in England.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mansion of the Earl, as well as that of his neighbour, Barbara's
      father, stood back about a mile from the highway, with which each was
      connected by an ordinary drive and lodge. It was along this particular
      highway that the young Earl drove on a certain evening at Christmastide
      some twenty years before the end of the last century, to attend a ball at
      Chene Manor, the home of Barbara, and her parents Sir John and Lady Grebe.
      Sir John's was a baronetcy created a few years before the breaking out of
      the Civil War, and his lands were even more extensive than those of Lord
      Uplandtowers himself; comprising this Manor of Chene, another on the coast
      near, half the Hundred of Cockdene, and well- enclosed lands in several
      other parishes, notably Warborne and those contiguous. At this time
      Barbara was barely seventeen, and the ball is the first occasion on which
      we have any tradition of Lord Uplandtowers attempting tender relations
      with her; it was early enough, God knows.
    </p>
    <p>
      An intimate friend-one of the Drenkhards-is said to have dined with him
      that day, and Lord Uplandtowers had, for a wonder, communicated to his
      guest the secret design of his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You'll never get her-sure; you'll never get her!' this friend had said at
      parting. 'She's not drawn to your lordship by love: and as for thought of
      a good match, why, there's no more calculation in her than in a bird.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'We'll see,' said Lord Uplandtowers impassively.
    </p>
    <p>
      He no doubt thought of his friend's forecast as he travelled along the
      highway in his chariot; but the sculptural repose of his profile against
      the vanishing daylight on his right hand would have shown his friend that
      the Earl's equanimity was undisturbed. He reached the solitary wayside
      tavern called Lornton Inn-the rendezvous of many a daring poacher for
      operations in the adjoining forest; and he might have observed, if he had
      taken the trouble, a strange post-chaise standing in the halting-space
      before the inn. He duly sped past it, and half-an- hour after through the
      little town of Warborne. Onward, a mile farther, was the house of his
      entertainer.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this date it was an imposing edifice-or, rather, congeries of
      edifices-as extensive as the residence of the Earl himself; though far
      less regular. One wing showed extreme antiquity, having huge chimneys,
      whose substructures projected from the external walls like towers; and a
      kitchen of vast dimensions, in which (it was said) breakfasts had been
      cooked for John of Gaunt. Whilst he was yet in the forecourt he could hear
      the rhythm of French horns and clarionets, the favourite instruments of
      those days at such entertainments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Entering the long parlour, in which the dance had just been opened by Lady
      Grebe with a minuet-it being now seven o'clock, according to the
      tradition-he was received with a welcome befitting his rank, and looked
      round for Barbara. She was not dancing, and seemed to be
      preoccupied-almost, indeed, as though she had been waiting for him.
      Barbara at this time was a good and pretty girl, who never spoke ill of
      any one, and hated other pretty women the very least possible. She did not
      refuse him for the country-dance which followed, and soon after was his
      partner in a second.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening wore on, and the horns and clarionets tootled merrily. Barbara
      evinced towards her lover neither distinct preference nor aversion; but
      old eyes would have seen that she pondered something. However, after
      supper she pleaded a headache, and disappeared. To pass the time of her
      absence, Lord Uplandtowers went into a little room adjoining the long
      gallery, where some elderly ones were sitting by the fire-for he had a
      phlegmatic dislike of dancing for its own sake,-and, lifting the
      window-curtains, he looked out of the window into the park and wood, dark
      now as a cavern. Some of the guests appeared to be leaving even so soon as
      this, two lights showing themselves as turning away from the door and
      sinking to nothing in the distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      His hostess put her head into the room to look for partners for the
      ladies, and Lord Uplandtowers came out. Lady Grebe informed him that
      Barbara had not returned to the ball-room: she had gone to bed in sheer
      necessity.
    </p>
    <p>
      'She has been so excited over the ball all day,' her mother continued,
      'that I feared she would be worn out early . . . But sure, Lord
      Uplandtowers, you won't be leaving yet?'
    </p>
    <p>
      He said that it was near twelve o'clock, and that some had already left.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I protest nobody has gone yet,' said Lady Grebe.
    </p>
    <p>
      To humour her he stayed till midnight, and then set out. He had made no
      progress in his suit; but he had assured himself that Barbara gave no
      other guest the preference, and nearly everybody in the neighbourhood was
      there.
    </p>
    <p>
      ''Tis only a matter of time,' said the calm young philosopher.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning he lay till near ten o'clock, and he had only just come
      out upon the head of the staircase when he heard hoofs upon the gravel
      without; in a few moments the door had been opened, and Sir John Grebe met
      him in the hall, as he set foot on the lowest stair.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My lord-where's Barbara-my daughter?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Even the Earl of Uplandtowers could not repress amazement. 'What's the
      matter, my dear Sir John,' says he.
    </p>
    <p>
      The news was startling, indeed. From the Baronet's disjointed explanation
      Lord Uplandtowers gathered that after his own and the other guests'
      departure Sir John and Lady Grebe had gone to rest without seeing any more
      of Barbara; it being understood by them that she had retired to bed when
      she sent word to say that she could not join the dancers again. Before
      then she had told her maid that she would dispense with her services for
      this night; and there was evidence to show that the young lady had never
      lain down at all, the bed remaining unpressed. Circumstances seemed to
      prove that the deceitful girl had feigned indisposition to get an excuse
      for leaving the ball-room, and that she had left the house within ten
      minutes, presumably during the first dance after supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I saw her go,' said Lord Uplandtowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The devil you did!' says Sir John.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes.' And he mentioned the retreating carriage-lights, and how he was
      assured by Lady Grebe that no guest had departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Surely that was it!' said the father. 'But she's not gone alone, d'ye
      know!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah-who is the young man?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I can on'y guess. My worst fear is my most likely guess. I'll say no
      more. I thought-yet I would not believe-it possible that you was the
      sinner. Would that you had been! But 'tis t'other, 'tis t'other, by G-
      &mdash;! I must e'en up, and after 'em!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Whom do you suspect?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir John would not give a name, and, stultified rather than agitated, Lord
      Uplandtowers accompanied him back to Chene. He again asked upon whom were
      the Baronet's suspicions directed; and the impulsive Sir John was no match
      for the insistence of Uplandtowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said at length, 'I fear 'tis Edmond Willowes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who's he?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A young fellow of Shottsford-Forum-a widow-woman's son,' the other told
      him, and explained that Willowes's father, or grandfather, was the last of
      the old glass-painters in that place, where (as you may know) the art
      lingered on when it had died out in every other part of England.
    </p>
    <p>
      'By G&mdash;- that's bad-mighty bad!' said Lord Uplandtowers, throwing
      himself back in the chaise in frigid despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      They despatched emissaries in all directions; one by the Melchester Road,
      another by Shottsford-Forum, another coastwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the lovers had a ten-hours' start; and it was apparent that sound
      judgment had been exercised in choosing as their time of flight the
      particular night when the movements of a strange carriage would not be
      noticed, either in the park or on the neighbouring highway, owing to the
      general press of vehicles. The chaise which had been seen waiting at
      Lornton Inn was, no doubt, the one they had escaped in; and the pair of
      heads which had planned so cleverly thus far had probably contrived
      marriage ere now.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fears of her parents were realized. A letter sent by special messenger
      from Barbara, on the evening of that day, briefly informed them that her
      lover and herself were on the way to London, and before this communication
      reached her home they would be united as husband and wife. She had taken
      this extreme step because she loved her dear Edmond as she could love no
      other man, and because she had seen closing round her the doom of marriage
      with Lord Uplandtowers, unless she put that threatened fate out of
      possibility by doing as she had done. She had well considered the step
      beforehand, and was prepared to live like any other country-townsman's
      wife if her father repudiated her for her action.
    </p>
    <p>
      'D&mdash;- her!' said Lord Uplandtowers, as he drove homeward that night.
      'D&mdash;- her for a fool!'-which shows the kind of love he bore her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well; Sir John had already started in pursuit of them as a matter of duty,
      driving like a wild man to Melchester, and thence by the direct highway to
      the capital. But he soon saw that he was acting to no purpose; and by and
      by, discovering that the marriage had actually taken place, he forebore
      all attempts to unearth them in the City, and returned and sat down with
      his lady to digest the event as best they could.
    </p>
    <p>
      To proceed against this Willowes for the abduction of our heiress was,
      possibly, in their power; yet, when they considered the now unalterable
      facts, they refrained from violent retribution. Some six weeks passed,
      during which time Barbara's parents, though they keenly felt her loss,
      held no communication with the truant, either for reproach or condonation.
      They continued to think of the disgrace she had brought upon herself; for,
      though the young man was an honest fellow, and the son of an honest
      father, the latter had died so early, and his widow had had such struggles
      to maintain herself; that the son was very imperfectly educated. Moreover,
      his blood was, as far as they knew, of no distinction whatever, whilst
      hers, through her mother, was compounded of the best juices of ancient
      baronial distillation, containing tinctures of Maundeville, and Mohun, and
      Syward, and Peverell, and Culliford, and Talbot, and Plantagenet, and
      York, and Lancaster, and God knows what besides, which it was a thousand
      pities to throw away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The father and mother sat by the fireplace that was spanned by the four-
      centred arch bearing the family shields on its haunches, and groaned
      aloud-the lady more than Sir John.
    </p>
    <p>
      'To think this should have come upon us in our old age!' said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Speak for yourself!' she snapped through her sobs. 'I am only one-and-
      forty! . . . Why didn't ye ride faster and overtake 'em!'
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime the young married lovers, caring no more about their blood
      than about ditch-water, were intensely happy-happy, that is, in the
      descending scale which, as we all know, Heaven in its wisdom has ordained
      for such rash cases; that is to say, the first week they were in the
      seventh heaven, the second in the sixth, the third week temperate, the
      fourth reflective, and so on; a lover's heart after possession being
      comparable to the earth in its geologic stages, as described to us
      sometimes by our worthy President; first a hot coal, then a warm one, then
      a cooling cinder, then chilly-the simile shall be pursued no further. The
      long and the short of it was that one day a letter, sealed with their
      daughter's own little seal, came into Sir John and Lady Grebe's hands;
      and, on opening it, they found it to contain an appeal from the young
      couple to Sir John to forgive them for what they had done, and they would
      fall on their naked knees and be most dutiful children for evermore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Sir John and his lady sat down again by the fireplace with the
      four-centred arch, and consulted, and re-read the letter. Sir John Grebe,
      if the truth must be told, loved his daughter's happiness far more, poor
      man, than he loved his name and lineage; he recalled to his mind all her
      little ways, gave vent to a sigh; and, by this time acclimatized to the
      idea of the marriage, said that what was done could not be undone, and
      that he supposed they must not be too harsh with her. Perhaps Barbara and
      her husband were in actual need; and how could they let their only child
      starve?
    </p>
    <p>
      A slight consolation had come to them in an unexpected manner. They had
      been credibly informed that an ancestor of plebeian Willowes was once
      honoured with intermarriage with a scion of the aristocracy who had gone
      to the dogs. In short, such is the foolishness of distinguished parents,
      and sometimes of others also, that they wrote that very day to the address
      Barbara had given them, informing her that she might return home and bring
      her husband with her; they would not object to see him, would not reproach
      her, and would endeavour to welcome both, and to discuss with them what
      could best be arranged for their future.
    </p>
    <p>
      In three or four days a rather shabby post-chaise drew up at the door of
      Chene Manor-house, at sound of which the tender-hearted baronet and his
      wife ran out as if to welcome a prince and princess of the blood. They
      were overjoyed to see their spoilt child return safe and sound-though she
      was only Mrs. Willowes, wife of Edmond Willowes of nowhere. Barbara burst
      into penitential tears, and both husband and wife were contrite enough, as
      well they might be, considering that they had not a guinea to call their
      own.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the four had calmed themselves, and not a word of chiding had been
      uttered to the pair, they discussed the position soberly, young Willowes
      sitting in the background with great modesty till invited forward by Lady
      Grebe in no frigid tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How handsome he is!' she said to herself. 'I don't wonder at Barbara's
      craze for him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He was, indeed, one of the handsomest men who ever set his lips on a
      maid's. A blue coat, murrey waistcoat, and breeches of drab set off a
      figure that could scarcely be surpassed. He had large dark eyes, anxious
      now, as they glanced from Barbara to her parents and tenderly back again
      to her; observing whom, even now in her trepidation, one could see why the
      sang froid of Lord Uplandtowers had been raised to more than lukewarmness.
      Her fair young face (according to the tale handed down by old women)
      looked out from under a gray conical hat, trimmed with white
      ostrich-feathers, and her little toes peeped from a buff petticoat worn
      under a puce gown. Her features were not regular: they were almost
      infantine, as you may see from miniatures in possession of the family, her
      mouth showing much sensitiveness, and one could be sure that her faults
      would not lie on the side of bad temper unless for urgent reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, they discussed their state as became them, and the desire of the
      young couple to gain the goodwill of those upon whom they were literally
      dependent for everything induced them to agree to any temporizing measure
      that was not too irksome. Therefore, having been nearly two months united,
      they did not oppose Sir John's proposal that he should furnish Edmond
      Willowes with funds sufficient for him to travel a year on the Continent
      in the company of a tutor, the young man undertaking to lend himself with
      the utmost diligence to the tutor's instructions, till he became polished
      outwardly and inwardly to the degree required in the husband of such a
      lady as Barbara. He was to apply himself to the study of languages,
      manners, history, society, ruins, and everything else that came under his
      eyes, till he should return to take his place without blushing by
      Barbara's side.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And by that time,' said worthy Sir John, 'I'll get my little place out at
      Yewsholt ready for you and Barbara to occupy on your return. The house is
      small and out of the way; but it will do for a young couple for a while.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If 'twere no bigger than a summer-house it would do!' says Barbara.
    </p>
    <p>
      'If 'twere no bigger than a sedan-chair!' says Willowes. 'And the more
      lonely the better.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'We can put up with the loneliness,' said Barbara, with less zest. 'Some
      friends will come, no doubt.'
    </p>
    <p>
      All this being laid down, a travelled tutor was called in-a man of many
      gifts and great experience,-and on a fine morning away tutor and pupil
      went. A great reason urged against Barbara accompanying her youthful
      husband was that his attentions to her would naturally be such as to
      prevent his zealously applying every hour of his time to learning and
      seeing-an argument of wise prescience, and unanswerable. Regular days for
      letter-writing were fixed, Barbara and her Edmond exchanged their last
      kisses at the door, and the chaise swept under the archway into the drive.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wrote to her from Le Havre, as soon as he reached that port, which was
      not for seven days, on account of adverse winds; he wrote from Rouen, and
      from Paris; described to her his sight of the King and Court at
      Versailles, and the wonderful marble-work and mirrors in that palace;
      wrote next from Lyons; then, after a comparatively long interval, from
      Turin, narrating his fearful adventures in crossing Mont Cenis on mules,
      and how he was overtaken with a terrific snowstorm, which had well-nigh
      been the end of him, and his tutor, and his guides. Then he wrote
      glowingly of Italy; and Barbara could see the development of her husband's
      mind reflected in his letters month by month; and she much admired the
      forethought of her father in suggesting this education for Edmond. Yet she
      sighed sometimes-her husband being no longer in evidence to fortify her in
      her choice of him-and timidly dreaded what mortifications might be in
      store for her by reason of this mesalliance. She went out very little; for
      on the one or two occasions on which she had shown herself to former
      friends she noticed a distinct difference in their manner, as though they
      should say, 'Ah, my happy swain's wife; you're caught!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Edmond's letters were as affectionate as ever; even more affectionate,
      after a while, than hers were to him. Barbara observed this growing
      coolness in herself; and like a good and honest lady was horrified and
      grieved, since her only wish was to act faithfully and uprightly. It
      troubled her so much that she prayed for a warmer heart, and at last wrote
      to her husband to beg him, now that he was in the land of Art, to send her
      his portrait, ever so small, that she might look at it all day and every
      day, and never for a moment forget his features.
    </p>
    <p>
      Willowes was nothing loth, and replied that he would do more than she
      wished: he had made friends with a sculptor in Pisa, who was much
      interested in him and his history; and he had commissioned this artist to
      make a bust of himself in marble, which when finished he would send her.
      What Barbara had wanted was something immediate; but she expressed no
      objection to the delay; and in his next communication Edmund told her that
      the sculptor, of his own choice, had decided to increase the bust to a
      full-length statue, so anxious was he to get a specimen of his skill
      introduced to the notice of the English aristocracy. It was progressing
      well, and rapidly.
    </p>

      Meanwhile, Barbara's attention began to be occupied at home with Yewsholt
      Lodge, the house that her kind-hearted father was preparing for her
      residence when her husband returned. It was a small place on the plan of a
      large one-a cottage built in the form of a mansion, having a central hall
      with a wooden gallery running round it, and rooms no bigger than closets
      to follow this introduction. It stood on a slope so solitary, and
      surrounded by trees so dense, that the birds who inhabited the boughs sang
      at strange hours, as if they hardly could distinguish night from day.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the progress of repairs at this bower Barbara frequently visited
      it. Though so secluded by the dense growth, it was near the high road, and
      one day while looking over the fence she saw Lord Uplandtowers riding
      past. He saluted her courteously, yet with mechanical stiffness, and did
      not halt. Barbara went home, and continued to pray that she might never
      cease to love her husband. After that she sickened, and did not come out
      of doors again for a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The year of education had extended to fourteen months, and the house was
      in order for Edmond's return to take up his abode there with Barbara,
      when, instead of the accustomed letter for her, came one to Sir John Grebe
      in the handwriting of the said tutor, informing him of a terrible
      catastrophe that had occurred to them at Venice. Mr Willowes and himself
      had attended the theatre one night during the Carnival of the preceding
      week, to witness the Italian comedy, when, owing to the carelessness of
      one of the candle-snuffers, the theatre had caught fire, and been burnt to
      the ground. Few persons had lost their lives, owing to the superhuman
      exertions of some of the audience in getting out the senseless sufferers;
      and, among them all, he who had risked his own life the most heroically
      was Mr. Willowes. In re-entering for the fifth time to save his
      fellow-creatures some fiery beams had fallen upon him, and he had been
      given up for lost. He was, however, by the blessing of Providence,
      recovered, with the life still in him, though he was fearfully burnt; and
      by almost a miracle he seemed likely to survive, his constitution being
      wondrously sound. He was, of course, unable to write, but he was receiving
      the attention of several skilful surgeons. Further report would be made by
      the next mail or by private hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tutor said nothing in detail of poor Willowes's sufferings, but as
      soon as the news was broken to Barbara she realized how intense they must
      have been, and her immediate instinct was to rush to his side, though, on
      consideration, the journey seemed impossible to her. Her health was by no
      means what it had been, and to post across Europe at that season of the
      year, or to traverse the Bay of Biscay in a sailing- craft, was an
      undertaking that would hardly be justified by the result. But she was
      anxious to go till, on reading to the end of the letter, her husband's
      tutor was found to hint very strongly against such a step if it should be
      contemplated, this being also the opinion of the surgeons. And though
      Willowes's comrade refrained from giving his reasons, they disclosed
      themselves plainly enough in the sequel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth was that the worst of the wounds resulting from the fire had
      occurred to his head and face-that handsome face which had won her heart
      from her,-and both the tutor and the surgeons knew that for a sensitive
      young woman to see him before his wounds had healed would cause more
      misery to her by the shock than happiness to him by her ministrations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Grebe blurted out what Sir John and Barbara had thought, but had had
      too much delicacy to express.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sure, 'tis mighty hard for you, poor Barbara, that the one little gift he
      had to justify your rash choice of him-his wonderful good looks-should be
      taken away like this, to leave 'ee no excuse at all for your conduct in
      the world's eyes . . . Well, I wish you'd married t'other-that do I!' And
      the lady sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He'll soon get right again,' said her father soothingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such remarks as the above were not often made; but they were frequent
      enough to cause Barbara an uneasy sense of self-stultification. She
      determined to hear them no longer; and the house at Yewsholt being ready
      and furnished, she withdrew thither with her maids, where for the first
      time she could feel mistress of a home that would be hers and her
      husband's exclusively, when he came.
    </p>
    <p>
      After long weeks Willowes had recovered sufficiently to be able to write
      himself; and slowly and tenderly he enlightened her upon the full extent
      of his injuries. It was a mercy, he said, that he had not lost his sight
      entirely; but he was thankful to say that he still retained full vision in
      one eye, though the other was dark for ever. The sparing manner in which
      he meted out particulars of his condition told Barbara how appalling had
      been his experience. He was grateful for her assurance that nothing could
      change her; but feared she did not fully realize that he was so sadly
      disfigured as to make it doubtful if she would recognize him. However, in
      spite of all, his heart was as true to her as it ever had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barbara saw from his anxiety how much lay behind. She replied that she
      submitted to the decrees of Fate, and would welcome him in any shape as
      soon as he could come. She told him of the pretty retreat in which she had
      taken up her abode, pending their joint occupation of it, and did not
      reveal how much she had sighed over the information that all his good
      looks were gone. Still less did she say that she felt a certain
      strangeness in awaiting him, the weeks they had lived together having been
      so short by comparison with the length of his absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly drew on the time when Willowes found himself well enough to come
      home. He landed at Southampton, and posted thence towards Yewsholt.
      Barbara arranged to go out to meet him as far as Lornton Inn-the spot
      between the Forest and the Chase at which he had waited for night on the
      evening of their elopement. Thither she drove at the appointed hour in a
      little pony-chaise, presented her by her father on her birthday for her
      especial use in her new house; which vehicle she sent back on arriving at
      the inn, the plan agreed upon being that she should perform the return
      journey with her husband in his hired coach.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was not much accommodation for a lady at this wayside tavern; but,
      as it was a fine evening in early summer, she did not mind-walking about
      outside, and straining her eyes along the highway for the expected one.
      But each cloud of dust that enlarged in the distance and drew near was
      found to disclose a conveyance other than his post-chaise. Barbara
      remained till the appointment was two hours passed, and then began to fear
      that owing to some adverse wind in the Channel he was not coming that
      night.
    </p>
    <p>
      While waiting she was conscious of a curious trepidation that was not
      entirely solicitude, and did not amount to dread; her tense state of
      incertitude bordered both on disappointment and on relief. She had lived
      six or seven weeks with an imperfectly educated yet handsome husband whom
      now she had not seen for seventeen months, and who was so changed
      physically by an accident that she was assured she would hardly know him.
      Can we wonder at her compound state of mind?
    </p>
    <p>
      But her immediate difficulty was to get away from Lornton Inn, for her
      situation was becoming embarrassing. Like too many of Barbara's actions,
      this drive had been undertaken without much reflection. Expecting to wait
      no more than a few minutes for her husband in his post-chaise, and to
      enter it with him, she had not hesitated to isolate herself by sending
      back her own little vehicle. She now found that, being so well known in
      this neighbourhood, her excursion to meet her long-absent husband was
      exciting great interest. She was conscious that more eyes were watching
      her from the inn-windows than met her own gaze. Barbara had decided to get
      home by hiring whatever kind of conveyance the tavern afforded, when,
      straining her eyes for the last time over the now darkening highway, she
      perceived yet another dust-cloud drawing near. She paused; a chariot
      ascended to the inn, and would have passed had not its occupant caught
      sight of her standing expectantly. The horses were checked on the instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You here-and alone, my dear Mrs. Willowes?' said Lord Uplandtowers, whose
      carriage it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      She explained what had brought her into this lonely situation; and, as he
      was going in the direction of her own home, she accepted his offer of a
      seat beside him. Their conversation was embarrassed and fragmentary at
      first; but when they had driven a mile or two she was surprised to find
      herself talking earnestly and warmly to him: her impulsiveness was in
      truth but the natural consequence of her late existence-a somewhat
      desolate one by reason of the strange marriage she had made; and there is
      no more indiscreet mood than that of a woman surprised into talk who has
      long been imposing upon herself a policy of reserve. Therefore her
      ingenuous heart rose with a bound into her throat when, in response to his
      leading questions, or rather hints, she allowed her troubles to leak out
      of her. Lord Uplandtowers took her quite to her own door, although he had
      driven three miles out of his way to do so; and in handing her down she
      heard from him a whisper of stern reproach: 'It need not have been thus if
      you had listened to me!'
    </p>
    <p>
      She made no reply, and went indoors. There, as the evening wore away, she
      regretted more and more that she had been so friendly with Lord
      Uplandtowers. But he had launched himself upon her so unexpectedly: if she
      had only foreseen the meeting with him, what a careful line of conduct she
      would have marked out! Barbara broke into a perspiration of disquiet when
      she thought of her unreserve, and, in self-chastisement, resolved to sit
      up till midnight on the bare chance of Edmond's return; directing that
      supper should be laid for him, improbable as his arrival till the morrow
      was.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hours went past, and there was dead silence in and round about
      Yewsholt Lodge, except for the soughing of the trees; till, when it was
      near upon midnight, she heard the noise of hoofs and wheels approaching
      the door. Knowing that it could only be her husband, Barbara instantly
      went into the hall to meet him. Yet she stood there not without a
      sensation of faintness, so many were the changes since their parting! And,
      owing to her casual encounter with Lord Uplandtowers, his voice and image
      still remained with her, excluding Edmond, her husband, from the inner
      circle of her impressions.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she went to the door, and the next moment a figure stepped inside, of
      which she knew the outline, but little besides. Her husband was attired in
      a flapping black cloak and slouched hat, appearing altogether as a
      foreigner, and not as the young English burgess who had left her side.
      When he came forward into the light of the lamp, she perceived with
      surprise, and almost with fright, that he wore a mask. At first she had
      not noticed this-there being nothing in its colour which would lead a
      casual observer to think he was looking on anything but a real
      countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      He must have seen her start of dismay at the unexpectedness of his
      appearance, for he said hastily: 'I did not mean to come in to you like
      this-I thought you would have been in bed. How good you are, dear
      Barbara!' He put his arm round her, but he did not attempt to kiss her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O Edmond-it is you?-it must be?' she said, with clasped hands, for though
      his figure and movement were almost enough to prove it, and the tones were
      not unlike the old tones, the enunciation was so altered as to seem that
      of a stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am covered like this to hide myself from the curious eyes of the inn-
      servants and others,' he said, in a low voice. 'I will send back the
      carriage and join you in a moment.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are quite alone?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Quite. My companion stopped at Southampton.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The wheels of the post-chaise rolled away as she entered the dining- room,
      where the supper was spread; and presently he rejoined her there. He had
      removed his cloak and hat, but the mask was still retained; and she could
      now see that it was of special make, of some flexible material like silk,
      coloured so as to represent flesh; it joined naturally to the front hair,
      and was otherwise cleverly executed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Barbara-you look ill,' he said, removing his glove, and taking her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes-I have been ill,' said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is this pretty little house ours?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O-yes.' She was hardly conscious of her words, for the hand he had
      ungloved in order to take hers was contorted, and had one or two of its
      fingers missing; while through the mask she discerned the twinkle of one
      eye only.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I would give anything to kiss you, dearest, now, at this moment!' he
      continued, with mournful passionateness. 'But I cannot-in this guise. The
      servants are abed, I suppose?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' said she. 'But I can call them? You will have some supper?'
    </p>
    <p>
      He said he would have some, but that it was not necessary to call anybody
      at that hour. Thereupon they approached the table, and sat down, facing
      each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite Barbara's scared state of mind, it was forced upon her notice that
      her husband trembled, as if he feared the impression he was producing, or
      was about to produce, as much as, or more than, she. He drew nearer, and
      took her hand again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I had this mask made at Venice,' he began, in evident embarrassment. 'My
      darling Barbara-my dearest wife-do you think you-will mind when I take it
      off? You will not dislike me-will you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O Edmond, of course I shall not mind,' said she. 'What has happened to
      you is our misfortune; but I am prepared for it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Are you sure you are prepared?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O yes! You are my husband.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You really feel quite confident that nothing external can affect you?' he
      said again, in a voice rendered uncertain by his agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I think I am-quite,' she answered faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bent his head. 'I hope, I hope you are,' he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the pause which followed, the ticking of the clock in the hall seemed
      to grow loud; and he turned a little aside to remove the mask. She
      breathlessly awaited the operation, which was one of some tediousness,
      watching him one moment, averting her face the next; and when it was done
      she shut her eyes at the hideous spectacle that was revealed. A quick
      spasm of horror had passed through her; but though she quailed she forced
      herself to regard him anew, repressing the cry that would naturally have
      escaped from her ashy lips. Unable to look at him longer, Barbara sank
      down on the floor beside her chair, covering her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You cannot look at me!' he groaned in a hopeless way. 'I am too terrible
      an object even for you to bear! I knew it; yet I hoped against it. Oh,
      this is a bitter fate-curse the skill of those Venetian surgeons who saved
      me alive! . . . Look up, Barbara,' he continued beseechingly; 'view me
      completely; say you loathe me, if you do loathe me, and settle the case
      between us for ever!'
    </p>
    <p>
      His unhappy wife pulled herself together for a desperate strain. He was
      her Edmond; he had done her no wrong; he had suffered. A momentary
      devotion to him helped her, and lifting her eyes as bidden she regarded
      this human remnant, this ecorche, a second time. But the sight was too
      much. She again involuntarily looked aside and shuddered.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you think you can get used to this?' he said. 'Yes or no! Can you bear
      such a thing of the charnel-house near you? Judge for yourself; Barbara.
      Your Adonis, your matchless man, has come to this!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor lady stood beside him motionless, save for the restlessness of
      her eyes. All her natural sentiments of affection and pity were driven
      clean out of her by a sort of panic; she had just the same sense of dismay
      and fearfulness that she would have had in the presence of an apparition.
      She could nohow fancy this to be her chosen one-the man she had loved; he
      was metamorphosed to a specimen of another species. 'I do not loathe you,'
      she said with trembling. 'But I am so horrified-so overcome! Let me
      recover myself. Will you sup now? And while you do so may I go to my room
      to-regain my old feeling for you? I will try, if I may leave you awhile?
      Yes, I will try!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Without waiting for an answer from him, and keeping her gaze carefully
      averted, the frightened woman crept to the door and out of the room. She
      heard him sit down to the table, as if to begin supper though, Heaven
      knows, his appetite was slight enough after a reception which had
      confirmed his worst surmises. When Barbara had ascended the stairs and
      arrived in her chamber she sank down, and buried her face in the coverlet
      of the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus she remained for some time. The bed-chamber was over the dining-
      room, and presently as she knelt Barbara heard Willowes thrust back his
      chair, and rise to go into the hall. In five minutes that figure would
      probably come up the stairs and confront her again; it,-this new and
      terrible form, that was not her husband's. In the loneliness of this
      night, with neither maid nor friend beside her, she lost all self-
      control, and at the first sound of his footstep on the stairs, without so
      much as flinging a cloak round her, she flew from the room, ran along the
      gallery to the back staircase, which she descended, and, unlocking the
      back door, let herself out. She scarcely was aware what she had done till
      she found herself in the greenhouse, crouching on a flower- stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here she remained, her great timid eyes strained through the glass upon
      the garden without, and her skirts gathered up, in fear of the field- mice
      which sometimes came there. Every moment she dreaded to hear footsteps
      which she ought by law to have longed for, and a voice that should have
      been as music to her soul. But Edmond Willowes came not that way. The
      nights were getting short at this season, and soon the dawn appeared, and
      the first rays of the sun. By daylight she had less fear than in the dark.
      She thought she could meet him, and accustom herself to the spectacle.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the much-tried young woman unfastened the door of the hot-house, and
      went back by the way she had emerged a few hours ago. Her poor husband was
      probably in bed and asleep, his journey having been long; and she made as
      little noise as possible in her entry. The house was just as she had left
      it, and she looked about in the hall for his cloak and hat, but she could
      not see them; nor did she perceive the small trunk which had been all that
      he brought with him, his heavier baggage having been left at Southampton
      for the road-waggon. She summoned courage to mount the stairs; the
      bedroom-door was open as she had left it. She fearfully peeped round; the
      bed had not been pressed. Perhaps he had lain down on the dining-room
      sofa. She descended and entered; he was not there. On the table beside his
      unsoiled plate lay a note, hastily written on the leaf of a pocket-book.
      It was something like this:
    </p>
    <p>
      'My ever-beloved Wife-The effect that my forbidding appearance has
      produced upon you was one which I foresaw as quite possible. I hoped
      against it, but foolishly so. I was aware that no human love could survive
      such a catastrophe. I confess I thought yours divine; but, after so long
      an absence, there could not be left sufficient warmth to overcome the too
      natural first aversion. It was an experiment, and it has failed. I do not
      blame you; perhaps, even, it is better so. Good- bye. I leave England for
      one year. You will see me again at the expiration of that time, if I live.
      Then I will ascertain your true feeling; and, if it be against me, go away
      for ever. E. W.'
    </p>
    <p>
      On recovering from her surprise, Barbara's remorse was such that she felt
      herself absolutely unforgiveable. She should have regarded him as an
      afflicted being, and not have been this slave to mere eyesight, like a
      child. To follow him and entreat him to return was her first thought. But
      on making inquiries she found that nobody had seen him: he had silently
      disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      More than this, to undo the scene of last night was impossible. Her terror
      had been too plain, and he was a man unlikely to be coaxed back by her
      efforts to do her duty. She went and confessed to her parents all that had
      occurred; which, indeed, soon became known to more persons than those of
      her own family.
    </p>
    <p>
      The year passed, and he did not return; and it was doubted if he were
      alive. Barbara's contrition for her unconquerable repugnance was now such
      that she longed to build a church-aisle, or erect a monument, and devote
      herself to deeds of charity for the remainder of her days. To that end she
      made inquiry of the excellent parson under whom she sat on Sundays, at a
      vertical distance of twenty feet. But he could only adjust his wig and tap
      his snuff-box; for such was the lukewarm state of religion in those days,
      that not an aisle, steeple, porch, east window, Ten-Commandment board,
      lion-and-unicorn, or brass candlestick, was required anywhere at all in
      the neighbourhood as a votive offering from a distracted soul-the last
      century contrasting greatly in this respect with the happy times in which
      we live, when urgent appeals for contributions to such objects pour in by
      every morning's post, and nearly all churches have been made to look like
      new pennies. As the poor lady could not ease her conscience this way, she
      determined at least to be charitable, and soon had the satisfaction of
      finding her porch thronged every morning by the raggedest, idlest, most
      drunken, hypocritical, and worthless tramps in Christendom.
    </p>
    <p>
      But human hearts are as prone to change as the leaves of the creeper on
      the wall, and in the course of time, hearing nothing of her husband,
      Barbara could sit unmoved whilst her mother and friends said in her
      hearing, 'Well, what has happened is for the best.' She began to think so
      herself; for even now she could not summon up that lopped and mutilated
      form without a shiver, though whenever her mind flew back to her early
      wedded days, and the man who had stood beside her then, a thrill of
      tenderness moved her, which if quickened by his living presence might have
      become strong. She was young and inexperienced, and had hardly on his late
      return grown out of the capricious fancies of girlhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he did not come again, and when she thought of his word that he would
      return once more, if living, and how unlikely he was to break his word,
      she gave him up for dead. So did her parents; so also did another
      person-that man of silence, of irresistible incisiveness, of still
      countenance, who was as awake as seven sentinels when he seemed to be as
      sound asleep as the figures on his family monument. Lord Uplandtowers,
      though not yet thirty, had chuckled like a caustic fogey of threescore
      when he heard of Barbara's terror and flight at her husband's return, and
      of the latter's prompt departure. He felt pretty sure, however, that
      Willowes, despite his hurt feelings, would have reappeared to claim his
      bright-eyed property if he had been alive at the end of the twelve months.
    </p>
    <p>
      As there was no husband to live with her, Barbara had relinquished the
      house prepared for them by her father, and taken up her abode anew at
      Chene Manor, as in the days of her girlhood. By degrees the episode with
      Edmond Willowes seemed but a fevered dream, and as the months grew to
      years Lord Uplandtowers' friendship with the people at Chene-which had
      somewhat cooled after Barbara's elopement-revived considerably, and he
      again became a frequent visitor there. He could not make the most trivial
      alteration or improvement at Knollingwood Hall, where he lived, without
      riding off to consult with his friend Sir John at Chene; and thus putting
      himself frequently under her eyes, Barbara grew accustomed to him, and
      talked to him as freely as to a brother. She even began to look up to him
      as a person of authority, judgment, and prudence; and though his severity
      on the bench towards poachers, smugglers, and turnip-stealers was matter
      of common notoriety, she trusted that much of what was said might be
      misrepresentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus they lived on till her husband's absence had stretched to years, and
      there could be no longer any doubt of his death. A passionless manner of
      renewing his addresses seemed no longer out of place in Lord Uplandtowers.
      Barbara did not love him, but hers was essentially one of those sweet-pea
      or with-wind natures which require a twig of stouter fibre than its own to
      hang upon and bloom. Now, too, she was older, and admitted to herself that
      a man whose ancestor had run scores of Saracens through and through in
      fighting for the site of the Holy Sepulchre was a more desirable husband,
      socially considered, than one who could only claim with certainty to know
      that his father and grandfather were respectable burgesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir John took occasion to inform her that she might legally consider
      herself a widow; and, in brief; Lord Uplandtowers carried his point with
      her, and she married him, though he could never get her to own that she
      loved him as she had loved Willowes. In my childhood I knew an old lady
      whose mother saw the wedding, and she said that when Lord and Lady
      Uplandtowers drove away from her father's house in the evening it was in a
      coach-and-four, and that my lady was dressed in green and silver, and wore
      the gayest hat and feather that ever were seen; though whether it was that
      the green did not suit her complexion, or otherwise, the Countess looked
      pale, and the reverse of blooming. After their marriage her husband took
      her to London, and she saw the gaieties of a season there; then they
      returned to Knollingwood Hall, and thus a year passed away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before their marriage her husband had seemed to care but little about her
      inability to love him passionately. 'Only let me win you,' he had said,
      'and I will submit to all that.' But now her lack of warmth seemed to
      irritate him, and he conducted himself towards her with a resentfulness
      which led to her passing many hours with him in painful silence. The
      heir-presumptive to the title was a remote relative, whom Lord
      Uplandtowers did not exclude from the dislike he entertained towards many
      persons and things besides, and he had set his mind upon a lineal
      successor. He blamed her much that there was no promise of this, and asked
      her what she was good for.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a particular day in her gloomy life a letter, addressed to her as Mrs.
      Willowes, reached Lady Uplandtowers from an unexpected quarter. A sculptor
      in Pisa, knowing nothing of her second marriage, informed her that the
      long-delayed life-size statue of Mr. Willowes, which, when her husband
      left that city, he had been directed to retain till it was sent for, was
      still in his studio. As his commission had not wholly been paid, and the
      statue was taking up room he could ill spare, he should be glad to have
      the debt cleared off, and directions where to forward the figure. Arriving
      at a time when the Countess was beginning to have little secrets (of a
      harmless kind, it is true) from her husband, by reason of their growing
      estrangement, she replied to this letter without saying a word to Lord
      Uplandtowers, sending off the balance that was owing to the sculptor, and
      telling him to despatch the statue to her without delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was some weeks before it arrived at Knollingwood Hall, and, by a
      singular coincidence, during the interval she received the first
      absolutely conclusive tidings of her Edmond's death. It had taken place
      years before, in a foreign land, about six months after their parting, and
      had been induced by the sufferings he had already undergone, coupled with
      much depression of spirit, which had caused him to succumb to a slight
      ailment. The news was sent her in a brief and formal letter from some
      relative of Willowes's in another part of England.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her grief took the form of passionate pity for his misfortunes, and of
      reproach to herself for never having been able to conquer her aversion to
      his latter image by recollection of what Nature had originally made him.
      The sad spectacle that had gone from earth had never been her Edmond at
      all to her. O that she could have met him as he was at first! Thus Barbara
      thought. It was only a few days later that a waggon with two horses,
      containing an immense packing-case, was seen at breakfast- time both by
      Barbara and her husband to drive round to the back of the house, and
      by-and-by they were informed that a case labelled 'Sculpture' had arrived
      for her ladyship.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What can that be?' said Lord Uplandtowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is the statue of poor Edmond, which belongs to me, but has never been
      sent till now,' she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Where are you going to put it?' asked he.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have not decided,' said the Countess. 'Anywhere, so that it will not
      annoy you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, it won't annoy me,' says he.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it had been unpacked in a back room of the house, they went to
      examine it. The statue was a full-length figure, in the purest Carrara
      marble, representing Edmond Willowes in all his original beauty, as he had
      stood at parting from her when about to set out on his travels; a specimen
      of manhood almost perfect in every line and contour. The work had been
      carried out with absolute fidelity.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Phoebus-Apollo, sure,' said the Earl of Uplandtowers, who had never seen
      Willowes, real or represented, till now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barbara did not hear him. She was standing in a sort of trance before the
      first husband, as if she had no consciousness of the other husband at her
      side. The mutilated features of Willowes had disappeared from her mind's
      eye; this perfect being was really the man she had loved, and not that
      later pitiable figure; in whom love and truth should have seen this image
      always, but had not done so.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not till Lord Uplandtowers said roughly, 'Are you going to stay
      here all the morning worshipping him?' that she roused herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband had not till now the least suspicion that Edmond Willowes
      originally looked thus, and he thought how deep would have been his
      jealousy years ago if Willowes had been known to him. Returning to the
      Hall in the afternoon he found his wife in the gallery, whither the statue
      had been brought.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was lost in reverie before it, just as in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What are you doing?' he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She started and turned. 'I am looking at my husb&mdash;- my statue, to see
      if it is well done,' she stammered. 'Why should I not?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'There's no reason why,' he said. 'What are you going to do with the
      monstrous thing? It can't stand here for ever.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't wish it,' she said. 'I'll find a place.'
    </p>
    <p>
      In her boudoir there was a deep recess, and while the Earl was absent from
      home for a few days in the following week, she hired joiners from the
      village, who under her directions enclosed the recess with a panelled
      door. Into the tabernacle thus formed she had the statue placed, fastening
      the door with a lock, the key of which she kept in her pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      When her husband returned he missed the statue from the gallery, and,
      concluding that it had been put away out of deference to his feelings,
      made no remark. Yet at moments he noticed something on his lady's face
      which he had never noticed there before. He could not construe it; it was
      a sort of silent ecstasy, a reserved beatification. What had become of the
      statue he could not divine, and growing more and more curious, looked
      about here and there for it till, thinking of her private room, he went
      towards that spot. After knocking he heard the shutting of a door, and the
      click of a key; but when he entered his wife was sitting at work, on what
      was in those days called knotting. Lord Uplandtowers' eye fell upon the
      newly-painted door where the recess had formerly been.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You have been carpentering in my absence then, Barbara,' he said
      carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, Uplandtowers.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why did you go putting up such a tasteless enclosure as that-spoiling the
      handsome arch of the alcove?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I wanted more closet-room; and I thought that as this was my own
      apartment-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of course,' he returned. Lord Uplandtowers knew now where the statue of
      young Willowes was.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night, or rather in the smallest hours of the morning, he missed the
      Countess from his side. Not being a man of nervous imaginings he fell
      asleep again before he had much considered the matter, and the next
      morning had forgotten the incident. But a few nights later the same
      circumstances occurred. This time he fully roused himself; but before he
      had moved to search for her, she entered the chamber in her dressing-
      gown, carrying a candle, which she extinguished as she approached, deeming
      him asleep. He could discover from her breathing that she was strangely
      moved; but not on this occasion either did he reveal that he had seen her.
      Presently, when she had lain down, affecting to wake, he asked her some
      trivial questions. 'Yes, Edmond,' she replied absently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Uplandtowers became convinced that she was in the habit of leaving
      the chamber in this queer way more frequently than he had observed, and he
      determined to watch. The next midnight he feigned deep sleep, and shortly
      after perceived her stealthily rise and let herself out of the room in the
      dark. He slipped on some clothing and followed. At the farther end of the
      corridor, where the clash of flint and steel would be out of the hearing
      of one in the bed-chamber, she struck a light. He stepped aside into an
      empty room till she had lit a taper and had passed on to her boudoir. In a
      minute or two he followed. Arrived at the door of the boudoir, he beheld
      the door of the private recess open, and Barbara within it, standing with
      her arms clasped tightly round the neck of her Edmond, and her mouth on
      his. The shawl which she had thrown round her nightclothes had slipped
      from her shoulders, and her long white robe and pale face lent her the
      blanched appearance of a second statue embracing the first. Between her
      kisses, she apostrophized it in a low murmur of infantine tenderness:
    </p>
    <p>
      'My only love-how could I be so cruel to you, my perfect one-so good and
      true-I am ever faithful to you, despite my seeming infidelity! I always
      think of you-dream of you-during the long hours of the day, and in the
      night-watches! O Edmond, I am always yours!' Such words as these,
      intermingled with sobs, and streaming tears, and dishevelled hair,
      testified to an intensity of feeling in his wife which Lord Uplandtowers
      had not dreamed of her possessing.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ha, ha!' says he to himself. 'This is where we evaporate-this is where my
      hopes of a successor in the title dissolve-ha, ha! This must be seen to,
      verily!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Uplandtowers was a subtle man when once he set himself to strategy;
      though in the present instance he never thought of the simple stratagem of
      constant tenderness. Nor did he enter the room and surprise his wife as a
      blunderer would have done, but went back to his chamber as silently as he
      had left it. When the Countess returned thither, shaken by spent sobs and
      sighs, he appeared to be soundly sleeping as usual. The next day he began
      his countermoves by making inquiries as to the whereabouts of the tutor
      who had travelled with his wife's first husband; this gentleman, he found,
      was now master of a grammar-school at no great distance from Knollingwood.
      At the first convenient moment Lord Uplandtowers went thither and obtained
      an interview with the said gentleman. The schoolmaster was much gratified
      by a visit from such an influential neighbour, and was ready to
      communicate anything that his lordship desired to know.
    </p>
    <p>
      After some general conversation on the school and its progress, the
      visitor observed that he believed the schoolmaster had once travelled a
      good deal with the unfortunate Mr. Willowes, and had been with him on the
      occasion of his accident. He, Lord Uplandtowers, was interested in knowing
      what had really happened at that time, and had often thought of inquiring.
      And then the Earl not only heard by word of mouth as much as he wished to
      know, but, their chat becoming more intimate, the schoolmaster drew upon
      paper a sketch of the disfigured head, explaining with bated breath
      various details in the representation.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It was very strange and terrible!' said Lord Uplandtowers, taking the
      sketch in his hand. 'Neither nose nor ears!'
    </p>
    <p>
      A poor man in the town nearest to Knollingwood Hall, who combined the art
      of sign-painting with ingenious mechanical occupations, was sent for by
      Lord Uplandtowers to come to the Hall on a day in that week when the
      Countess had gone on a short visit to her parents. His employer made the
      man understand that the business in which his assistance was demanded was
      to be considered private, and money insured the observance of this
      request. The lock of the cupboard was picked, and the ingenious mechanic
      and painter, assisted by the schoolmaster's sketch, which Lord
      Uplandtowers had put in his pocket, set to work upon the god-like
      countenance of the statue under my lord's direction. What the fire had
      maimed in the original the chisel maimed in the copy. It was a fiendish
      disfigurement, ruthlessly carried out, and was rendered still more
      shocking by being tinted to the hues of life, as life had been after the
      wreck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six hours after, when the workman was gone, Lord Uplandtowers looked upon
      the result, and smiled grimly, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      'A statue should represent a man as he appeared in life, and that's as he
      appeared. Ha! ha! But 'tis done to good purpose, and not idly.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He locked the door of the closet with a skeleton key, and went his way to
      fetch the Countess home.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night she slept, but he kept awake. According to the tale, she
      murmured soft words in her dream; and he knew that the tender converse of
      her imaginings was held with one whom he had supplanted but in name. At
      the end of her dream the Countess of Uplandtowers awoke and arose, and
      then the enactment of former nights was repeated. Her husband remained
      still and listened. Two strokes sounded from the clock in the pediment
      without, when, leaving the chamber-door ajar, she passed along the
      corridor to the other end, where, as usual, she obtained a light. So deep
      was the silence that he could even from his bed hear her softly blowing
      the tinder to a glow after striking the steel. She moved on into the
      boudoir, and he heard, or fancied he heard, the turning of the key in the
      closet-door. The next moment there came from that direction a loud and
      prolonged shriek, which resounded to the farthest corners of the house. It
      was repeated, and there was the noise of a heavy fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Uplandtowers sprang out of bed. He hastened along the dark corridor
      to the door of the boudoir, which stood ajar, and, by the light of the
      candle within, saw his poor young Countess lying in a heap in her
      nightdress on the floor of the closet. When he reached her side he found
      that she had fainted, much to the relief of his fears that matters were
      worse. He quickly shut up and locked in the hated image which had done the
      mischief; and lifted his wife in his arms, where in a few instants she
      opened her eyes. Pressing her face to his without saying a word, he
      carried her back to her room, endeavouring as he went to disperse her
      terrors by a laugh in her ear, oddly compounded of causticity,
      predilection, and brutality.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ho-ho-ho!' says he. 'Frightened, dear one, hey? What a baby 'tis! Only a
      joke, sure, Barbara-a splendid joke! But a baby should not go to closets
      at midnight to look for the ghost of the dear departed! If it do it must
      expect to be terrified at his aspect-ho-ho-ho!'
    </p>
    <p>
      When she was in her bed-chamber, and had quite come to herself; though her
      nerves were still much shaken, he spoke to her more sternly. 'Now, my
      lady, answer me: do you love him-eh?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No-no!' she faltered, shuddering, with her expanded eyes fixed on her
      husband. 'He is too terrible-no, no!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are sure?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Quite sure!' replied the poor broken-spirited Countess. But her natural
      elasticity asserted itself. Next morning he again inquired of her: 'Do you
      love him now?'
    </p>
    <p>
      She quailed under his gaze, but did not reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      'That means that you do still, by G&mdash;-!' he continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It means that I will not tell an untruth, and do not wish to incense my
      lord,' she answered, with dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then suppose we go and have another look at him?' As he spoke, he
      suddenly took her by the wrist, and turned as if to lead her towards the
      ghastly closet.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No-no! Oh-no!' she cried, and her desperate wriggle out of his hand
      revealed that the fright of the night had left more impression upon her
      delicate soul than superficially appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Another dose or two, and she will be cured,' he said to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now so generally known that the Earl and Countess were not in
      accord, that he took no great trouble to disguise his deeds in relation to
      this matter. During the day he ordered four men with ropes and rollers to
      attend him in the boudoir. When they arrived, the closet was open, and the
      upper part of the statue tied up in canvas. He had it taken to the
      sleeping-chamber. What followed is more or less matter of conjecture. The
      story, as told to me, goes on to say that, when Lady Uplandtowers retired
      with him that night, she saw near the foot of the heavy oak four-poster, a
      tall dark wardrobe, which had not stood there before; but she did not ask
      what its presence meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have had a little whim,' he explained when they were in the dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Have you?' says she.
    </p>
    <p>
      'To erect a little shrine, as it may be called.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A little shrine?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes; to one whom we both equally adore-eh? I'll show you what it
      contains.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He pulled a cord which hung covered by the bed-curtains, and the doors of
      the wardrobe slowly opened, disclosing that the shelves within had been
      removed throughout, and the interior adapted to receive the ghastly
      figure, which stood there as it had stood in the boudoir, but with a
      wax-candle burning on each side of it to throw the cropped and distorted
      features into relief. She clutched him, uttered a low scream, and buried
      her head in the bedclothes. 'Oh, take it away-please take it away!' she
      implored.
    </p>
    <p>
      'All in good time namely, when you love me best,' he returned calmly. 'You
      don't quite yet-eh?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't know-I think-O Uplandtowers, have mercy-I cannot bear it-O, in
      pity, take it away!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nonsense; one gets accustomed to anything. Take another gaze.'
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, he allowed the doors to remain unclosed at the foot of the bed,
      and the wax-tapers burning; and such was the strange fascination of the
      grisly exhibition that a morbid curiosity took possession of the Countess
      as she lay, and, at his repeated request, she did again look out from the
      coverlet, shuddered, hid her eyes, and looked again, all the while begging
      him to take it away, or it would drive her out of her senses. But he would
      not do so as yet, and the wardrobe was not locked till dawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scene was repeated the next night. Firm in enforcing his ferocious
      correctives, he continued the treatment till the nerves of the poor lady
      were quivering in agony under the virtuous tortures inflicted by her lord,
      to bring her truant heart back to faithfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third night, when the scene had opened as usual, and she lay staring
      with immense wild eyes at the horrid fascination, on a sudden she gave an
      unnatural laugh; she laughed more and more, staring at the image, till she
      literally shrieked with laughter: then there was silence, and he found her
      to have become insensible. He thought she had fainted, but soon saw that
      the event was worse: she was in an epileptic fit. He started up, dismayed
      by the sense that, like many other subtle personages, he had been too
      exacting for his own interests. Such love as he was capable of, though
      rather a selfish gloating than a cherishing solicitude, was fanned into
      life on the instant. He closed the wardrobe with the pulley, clasped her
      in his arms, took her gently to the window, and did all he could to
      restore her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a long time before the Countess came to herself, and when she did
      so, a considerable change seemed to have taken place in her emotions. She
      flung her arms around him, and with gasps of fear abjectly kissed him many
      times, at last bursting into tears. She had never wept in this scene
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You'll take it away, dearest-you will!' she begged plaintively.
    </p>
    <p>
      'If you love me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I do-oh, I do!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And hate him, and his memory?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes-yes!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Thoroughly?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I cannot endure recollection of him!' cried the poor Countess slavishly.
      'It fills me with shame-how could I ever be so depraved! I'll never behave
      badly again, Uplandtowers; and you will never put the hated statue again
      before my eyes?'
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt that he could promise with perfect safety. 'Never,' said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And then I'll love you,' she returned eagerly, as if dreading lest the
      scourge should be applied anew. 'And I'll never, never dream of thinking a
      single thought that seems like faithlessness to my marriage vow.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The strange thing now was that this fictitious love wrung from her by
      terror took on, through mere habit of enactment, a certain quality of
      reality. A servile mood of attachment to the Earl became distinctly
      visible in her contemporaneously with an actual dislike for her late
      husband's memory. The mood of attachment grew and continued when the
      statue was removed. A permanent revulsion was operant in her, which
      intensified as time wore on. How fright could have effected such a change
      of idiosyncrasy learned physicians alone can say; but I believe such cases
      of reactionary instinct are not unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      The upshot was that the cure became so permanent as to be itself a new
      disease. She clung to him so tightly, that she would not willingly be out
      of his sight for a moment. She would have no sitting-room apart from his,
      though she could not help starting when he entered suddenly to her. Her
      eyes were well-nigh always fixed upon him. If he drove out, she wished to
      go with him; his slightest civilities to other women made her frantically
      jealous; till at length her very fidelity became a burden to him,
      absorbing his time, and curtailing his liberty, and causing him to curse
      and swear. If he ever spoke sharply to her now, she did not revenge
      herself by flying off to a mental world of her own; all that affection for
      another, which had provided her with a resource, was now a cold black
      cinder.
    </p>
    <p>
      From that time the life of this scared and enervated lady-whose existence
      might have been developed to so much higher purpose but for the ignoble
      ambition of her parents and the conventions of the time-was one of
      obsequious amativeness towards a perverse and cruel man. Little personal
      events came to her in quick succession-half a dozen, eight, nine, ten such
      events,-in brief; she bore him no less than eleven children in the eight
      following years, but half of them came prematurely into the world, or died
      a few days old; only one, a girl, attained to maturity; she in after years
      became the wife of the Honourable Mr. Beltonleigh, who was created Lord
      D'Almaine, as may be remembered.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no living son and heir. At length, completely worn out in mind
      and body, Lady Uplandtowers was taken abroad by her husband, to try the
      effect of a more genial climate upon her wasted frame. But nothing availed
      to strengthen her, and she died at Florence, a few months after her
      arrival in Italy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Contrary to expectation, the Earl of Uplandtowers did not marry again.
      Such affection as existed in him-strange, hard, brutal as it was-seemed
      untransferable, and the title, as is known, passed at his death to his
      nephew. Perhaps it may not be so generally known that, during the
      enlargement of the Hall for the sixth Earl, while digging in the grounds
      for the new foundations, the broken fragments of a marble statue were
      unearthed. They were submitted to various antiquaries, who said that, so
      far as the damaged pieces would allow them to form an opinion, the statue
      seemed to be that of a mutilated Roman satyr; or if not, an allegorical
      figure of Death. Only one or two old inhabitants guessed whose statue
      those fragments had composed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I should have added that, shortly after the death of the Countess, an
      excellent sermon was preached by the Dean of Melchester, the subject of
      which, though names were not mentioned, was unquestionably suggested by
      the aforesaid events. He dwelt upon the folly of indulgence in sensuous
      love for a handsome form merely; and showed that the only rational and
      virtuous growths of that affection were those based upon intrinsic worth.
      In the case of the tender but somewhat shallow lady whose life I have
      related, there is no doubt that an infatuation for the person of young
      Willowes was the chief feeling that induced her to marry him; which was
      the more deplorable in that his beauty, by all tradition, was the least of
      his recommendations, every report bearing out the inference that he must
      have been a man of steadfast nature, bright intelligence, and promising
      life.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The company thanked the old surgeon for his story, which the rural dean
      declared to be a far more striking one than anything he could hope to
      tell. An elderly member of the Club, who was mostly called the Bookworm,
      said that a woman's natural instinct of fidelity would, indeed, send back
      her heart to a man after his death in a truly wonderful manner
      sometimes-if anything occurred to put before her forcibly the original
      affection between them, and his original aspect in her eyes,-whatever his
      inferiority may have been, social or otherwise; and then a general
      conversation ensued upon the power that a woman has of seeing the actual
      in the representation, the reality in the dream-a power which (according
      to the sentimental member) men have no faculty of equalling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rural dean thought that such cases as that related by the surgeon were
      rather an illustration of passion electrified back to life than of a
      latent, true affection. The story had suggested that he should try to
      recount to them one which he had used to hear in his youth, and which
      afforded an instance of the latter and better kind of feeling, his heroine
      being also a lady who had married beneath her, though he feared his
      narrative would be of a much slighter kind than the surgeon's. The Club
      begged him to proceed, and the parson began.

    <h2>
      DAME THE THIRD-THE MARCHIONESS OF STONEHENGE
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By the Rural Dean
    </h3>
    <p>
      I would have you know, then, that a great many years ago there lived in a
      classical mansion with which I used to be familiar, standing not a hundred
      miles from the city of Melchester, a lady whose personal charms were so
      rare and unparalleled that she was courted, flattered, and spoilt by
      almost all the young noblemen and gentlemen in that part of Wessex. For a
      time these attentions pleased her well. But as, in the words of good
      Robert South (whose sermons might be read much more than they are), the
      most passionate lover of sport, if tied to follow his hawks and hounds
      every day of his life, would find the pursuit the greatest torment and
      calamity, and would fly to the mines and galleys for his recreation, so
      did this lofty and beautiful lady after a while become satiated with the
      constant iteration of what she had in its novelty enjoyed; and by an
      almost natural revulsion turned her regards absolutely netherward,
      socially speaking. She perversely and passionately centred her affection
      on quite a plain-looking young man of humble birth and no position at all;
      though it is true that he was gentle and delicate in nature, of good
      address, and guileless heart. In short, he was the parish-clerk's son,
      acting as assistant to the land- steward of her father, the Earl of Avon,
      with the hope of becoming some day a land-steward himself. It should be
      said that perhaps the Lady Caroline (as she was called) was a little
      stimulated in this passion by the discovery that a young girl of the
      village already loved the young man fondly, and that he had paid some
      attentions to her, though merely of a casual and good-natured kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since his occupation brought him frequently to the manor-house and its
      environs, Lady Caroline could make ample opportunities of seeing and
      speaking to him. She had, in Chaucer's phrase, 'all the craft of fine
      loving' at her fingers' ends, and the young man, being of a readily-
      kindling heart, was quick to notice the tenderness in her eyes and voice.
      He could not at first believe in his good fortune, having no understanding
      of her weariness of more artificial men; but a time comes when the
      stupidest sees in an eye the glance of his other half; and it came to him,
      who was quite the reverse of dull. As he gained confidence accidental
      encounters led to encounters by design; till at length when they were
      alone together there was no reserve on the matter. They whispered tender
      words as other lovers do, and were as devoted a pair as ever was seen. But
      not a ray or symptom of this attachment was allowed to show itself to the
      outer world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, as she became less and less scrupulous towards him under the
      influence of her affection, and he became more and more reverential under
      the influence of his, and they looked the situation in the face together,
      their condition seemed intolerable in its hopelessness. That she could
      ever ask to be allowed to marry him, or could hold her tongue and quietly
      renounce him, was equally beyond conception. They resolved upon a third
      course, possessing neither of the disadvantages of these two: to wed
      secretly, and live on in outward appearance the same as before. In this
      they differed from the lovers of my friend's story.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a soul in the parental mansion guessed, when Lady Caroline came coolly
      into the hall one day after a visit to her aunt, that, during that visit,
      her lover and herself had found an opportunity of uniting themselves till
      death should part them. Yet such was the fact; the young woman who rode
      fine horses, and drove in pony-chaises, and was saluted deferentially by
      every one, and the young man who trudged about, and directed the
      tree-felling, and the laying out of fish-ponds in the park, were husband
      and wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they had planned, so they acted to the letter for the space of a month
      and more, clandestinely meeting when and where they best could do so; both
      being supremely happy and content. To be sure, towards the latter part of
      that month, when the first wild warmth of her love had gone off, the Lady
      Caroline sometimes wondered within herself how she, who might have chosen
      a peer of the realm, baronet, knight; or, if serious-minded, a bishop or
      judge of the more gallant sort who prefer young wives, could have brought
      herself to do a thing so rash as to make this marriage; particularly when,
      in their private meetings, she perceived that though her young husband was
      full of ideas, and fairly well read, they had not a single social
      experience in common. It was his custom to visit her after nightfall, in
      her own house, when he could find no opportunity for an interview
      elsewhere; and to further this course she would contrive to leave
      unfastened a window on the ground- floor overlooking the lawn, by entering
      which a back stair-case was accessible; so that he could climb up to her
      apartments, and gain audience of his lady when the house was still.
    </p>
    <p>
      One dark midnight, when he had not been able to see her during the day, he
      made use of this secret method, as he had done many times before; and when
      they had remained in company about an hour he declared that it was time
      for him to descend.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would have stayed longer, but that the interview had been a somewhat
      painful one. What she had said to him that night had much excited and
      angered him, for it had revealed a change in her; cold reason had come to
      his lofty wife; she was beginning to have more anxiety about her own
      position and prospects than ardour for him. Whether from the agitation of
      this perception or not, he was seized with a spasm; he gasped, rose, and
      in moving towards the window for air he uttered in a short thick whisper,
      'Oh, my heart!'
    </p>
    <p>
      With his hand upon his chest he sank down to the floor before he had gone
      another step. By the time that she had relighted the candle, which had
      been extinguished in case any eye in the opposite grounds should witness
      his egress, she found that his poor heart had ceased to beat; and there
      rushed upon her mind what his cottage-friends had once told her, that he
      was liable to attacks of heart-disease, one of which, the doctor had
      informed them, might some day carry him off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accustomed as she was to doctoring the other parishioners, nothing that
      she could effect upon him in that kind made any difference whatever; and
      his stillness, and the increasing coldness of his feet and hands,
      disclosed too surely to the affrighted young woman that her husband was
      dead indeed. For more than an hour, however, she did not abandon her
      efforts to restore him; when she fully realized the fact that he was a
      corpse she bent over his body, distracted and bewildered as to what step
      she next should take.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her first feelings had undoubtedly been those of passionate grief at the
      loss of him; her second thoughts were concern at her own position as the
      daughter of an earl. 'Oh, why, why, my unfortunate husband, did you die in
      my chamber at this hour!' she said piteously to the corpse. 'Why not have
      died in your own cottage if you would die! Then nobody would ever have
      known of our imprudent union, and no syllable would have been breathed of
      how I mismated myself for love of you!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The clock in the courtyard striking the hour of one aroused Lady Caroline
      from the stupor into which she had fallen, and she stood up, and went
      towards the door. To awaken and tell her mother seemed her only way out of
      this terrible situation; yet when she put her hand on the key to unlock it
      she withdrew herself again. It would be impossible to call even her
      mother's assistance without risking a revelation to all the world through
      the servants; while if she could remove the body unassisted to a distance
      she might avert suspicion of their union even now. This thought of
      immunity from the social consequences of her rash act, of renewed freedom,
      was indubitably a relief to her, for, as has been said, the constraint and
      riskiness of her position had begun to tell upon the Lady Caroline's
      nerves.
    </p>
    <p>
      She braced herself for the effort, and hastily dressed herself; and then
      dressed him. Tying his dead hands together with a handkerchief; she laid
      his arms round her shoulders, and bore him to the landing and down the
      narrow stairs. Reaching the bottom by the window, she let his body slide
      slowly over the sill till it lay on the ground without. She then climbed
      over the window-sill herself, and, leaving the sash open, dragged him on
      to the lawn with a rustle not louder than the rustle of a broom. There she
      took a securer hold, and plunged with him under the trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Away from the precincts of the house she could apply herself more
      vigorously to her task, which was a heavy one enough for her, robust as
      she was; and the exertion and fright she had already undergone began to
      tell upon her by the time she reached the corner of a beech-plantation
      which intervened between the manor-house and the village. Here she was so
      nearly exhausted that she feared she might have to leave him on the spot.
      But she plodded on after a while, and keeping upon the grass at every
      opportunity she stood at last opposite the poor young man's garden-gate,
      where he lived with his father, the parish-clerk. How she accomplished the
      end of her task Lady Caroline never quite knew; but, to avoid leaving
      traces in the road, she carried him bodily across the gravel, and laid him
      down at the door. Perfectly aware of his ways of coming and going, she
      searched behind the shutter for the cottage door- key, which she placed in
      his cold hand. Then she kissed his face for the last time, and with silent
      little sobs bade him farewell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Caroline retraced her steps, and reached the mansion without
      hindrance; and to her great relief found the window open just as she had
      left it. When she had climbed in she listened attentively, fastened the
      window behind her, and ascending the stairs noiselessly to her room, set
      everything in order, and returned to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning it was speedily echoed around that the amiable and gentle
      young villager had been found dead outside his father's door, which he had
      apparently been in the act of unlocking when he fell. The circumstances
      were sufficiently exceptional to justify an inquest, at which syncope from
      heart-disease was ascertained to be beyond doubt the explanation of his
      death, and no more was said about the matter then. But, after the funeral,
      it was rumoured that some man who had been returning late from a distant
      horse-fair had seen in the gloom of night a person, apparently a woman,
      dragging a heavy body of some sort towards the cottage-gate, which, by the
      light of after events, would seem to have been the corpse of the young
      fellow. His clothes were thereupon examined more particularly than at
      first, with the result that marks of friction were visible upon them here
      and there, precisely resembling such as would be left by dragging on the
      ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our beautiful and ingenious Lady Caroline was now in great consternation;
      and began to think that, after all, it might have been better to honestly
      confess the truth. But having reached this stage without discovery or
      suspicion, she determined to make another effort towards concealment; and
      a bright idea struck her as a means of securing it. I think I mentioned
      that, before she cast eyes on the unfortunate steward's clerk, he had been
      the beloved of a certain village damsel, the woodman's daughter, his
      neighbour, to whom he had paid some attentions; and possibly he was
      beloved of her still. At any rate, the Lady Caroline's influence on the
      estates of her father being considerable, she resolved to seek an
      interview with the young girl in furtherance of her plan to save her
      reputation, about which she was now exceedingly anxious; for by this time,
      the fit being over, she began to be ashamed of her mad passion for her
      late husband, and almost wished she had never seen him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of her parish-visiting she lighted on the young girl without
      much difficulty, and found her looking pale and sad, and wearing a simple
      black gown, which she had put on out of respect for the young man's
      memory, whom she had tenderly loved, though he had not loved her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, you have lost your lover, Milly,' said Lady Caroline.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young woman could not repress her tears. 'My lady, he was not quite my
      lover,' she said. 'But I was his-and now he is dead I don't care to live
      any more!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Can you keep a secret about him?' asks the lady; 'one in which his honour
      is involved-which is known to me alone, but should be known to you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl readily promised, and, indeed, could be safely trusted on such a
      subject, so deep was her affection for the youth she mourned.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then meet me at his grave to-night, half-an-hour after sunset, and I will
      tell it to you,' says the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the dusk of that spring evening the two shadowy figures of the young
      women converged upon the assistant-steward's newly-turfed mound; and at
      that solemn place and hour, the one of birth and beauty unfolded her tale:
      how she had loved him and married him secretly; how he had died in her
      chamber; and how, to keep her secret, she had dragged him to his own door.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Married him, my lady!' said the rustic maiden, starting back.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have said so,' replied Lady Caroline. 'But it was a mad thing, and a
      mistaken course. He ought to have married you. You, Milly, were peculiarly
      his. But you lost him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' said the poor girl; 'and for that they laughed at me. "Ha-ha, you
      mid love him, Milly," they said; "but he will not love you!"'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Victory over such unkind jeerers would be sweet,' said Lady Caroline.
      'You lost him in life; but you may have him in death as if you had had him
      in life; and so turn the tables upon them.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How?' said the breathless girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young lady then unfolded her plan, which was that Milly should go
      forward and declare that the young man had contracted a secret marriage
      (as he truly had done); that it was with her, Milly, his sweetheart; that
      he had been visiting her in her cottage on the evening of his death; when,
      on finding he was a corpse, she had carried him to his house to prevent
      discovery by her parents, and that she had meant to keep the whole matter
      a secret till the rumours afloat had forced it from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And how shall I prove this?' said the woodman's daughter, amazed at the
      boldness of the proposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Quite sufficiently. You can say, if necessary, that you were married to
      him at the church of St. Michael, in Bath City, in my name, as the first
      that occurred to you, to escape detection. That was where he married me. I
      will support you in this.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh-I don't quite like-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If you will do so,' said the lady peremptorily, 'I will always be your
      father's friend and yours; if not, it will be otherwise. And I will give
      you my wedding-ring, which you shall wear as yours.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Have you worn it, my lady?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Only at night.'
    </p>
    <p>
      There was not much choice in the matter, and Milly consented. Then this
      noble lady took from her bosom the ring she had never been able openly to
      exhibit, and, grasping the young girl's hand, slipped it upon her finger
      as she stood upon her lover's grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly shivered, and bowed her head, saying, 'I feel as if I had become a
      corpse's bride!'
    </p>
    <p>
      But from that moment the maiden was heart and soul in the substitution. A
      blissful repose came over her spirit. It seemed to her that she had
      secured in death him whom in life she had vainly idolized; and she was
      almost content. After that the lady handed over to the young man's new
      wife all the little mementoes and trinkets he had given herself; even to a
      locket containing his hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day the girl made her so-called confession, which the simple
      mourning she had already worn, without stating for whom, seemed to bear
      out; and soon the story of the little romance spread through the village
      and country-side, almost as far as Melchester. It was a curious
      psychological fact that, having once made the avowal, Milly seemed
      possessed with a spirit of ecstasy at her position. With the liberal sum
      of money supplied to her by Lady Caroline she now purchased the garb of a
      widow, and duly appeared at church in her weeds, her simple face looking
      so sweet against its margin of crape that she was almost envied her state
      by the other village-girls of her age. And when a woman's sorrow for her
      beloved can maim her young life so obviously as it had done Milly's there
      was, in truth, little subterfuge in the case. Her explanation tallied so
      well with the details of her lover's latter movements-those strange
      absences and sudden returnings, which had occasionally puzzled his
      friends-that nobody supposed for a moment that the second actor in these
      secret nuptials was other than she. The actual and whole truth would
      indeed have seemed a preposterous assertion beside this plausible one, by
      reason of the lofty demeanour of the Lady Caroline and the unassuming
      habits of the late villager. There being no inheritance in question, not a
      soul took the trouble to go to the city church, forty miles off, and
      search the registers for marriage signatures bearing out so humble a
      romance.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a short time Milly caused a decent tombstone to be erected over her
      nominal husband's grave, whereon appeared the statement that it was placed
      there by his heartbroken widow, which, considering that the payment for it
      came from Lady Caroline and the grief from Milly, was as truthful as such
      inscriptions usually are, and only required pluralizing to render it yet
      more nearly so.
    </p>
    <p>
      The impressionable and complaisant Milly, in her character of widow, took
      delight in going to his grave every day, and indulging in sorrow which was
      a positive luxury to her. She placed fresh flowers on his grave, and so
      keen was her emotional imaginativeness that she almost believed herself to
      have been his wife indeed as she walked to and fro in her garb of woe. One
      afternoon, Milly being busily engaged in this labour of love at the grave,
      Lady Caroline passed outside the churchyard wall with some of her visiting
      friends, who, seeing Milly there, watched her actions with interest,
      remarked upon the pathos of the scene, and upon the intense affection the
      young man must have felt for such a tender creature as Milly. A strange
      light, as of pain, shot from the Lady Caroline's eye, as if for the first
      time she begrudged to the young girl the position she had been at such
      pains to transfer to her; it showed that a slumbering affection for her
      husband still had life in Lady Caroline, obscured and stifled as it was by
      social considerations.
    </p>
    <p>
      An end was put to this smooth arrangement by the sudden appearance in the
      churchyard one day of the Lady Caroline, when Milly had come there on her
      usual errand of laying flowers. Lady Caroline had been anxiously awaiting
      her behind the chancel, and her countenance was pale and agitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Milly!' she said, 'come here! I don't know how to say to you what I am
      going to say. I am half dead!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am sorry for your ladyship,' says Milly, wondering.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Give me that ring!' says the lady, snatching at the girl's left hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly drew it quickly away.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I tell you give it to me!' repeated Caroline, almost fiercely. 'Oh-but
      you don't know why? I am in a grief and a trouble I did not expect!' And
      Lady Caroline whispered a few words to the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O my lady!' said the thunderstruck Milly. 'What will you do?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You must say that your statement was a wicked lie, an invention, a
      scandal, a deadly sin-that I told you to make it to screen me! That it was
      I whom he married at Bath. In short, we must tell the truth, or I am
      ruined-body, mind, and reputation-for ever!'
    </p>
    <p>
      But there is a limit to the flexibility of gentle-souled women. Milly by
      this time had so grown to the idea of being one flesh with this young man,
      of having the right to bear his name as she bore it; had so thoroughly
      come to regard him as her husband, to dream of him as her husband, to
      speak of him as her husband, that she could not relinquish him at a
      moment's peremptory notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, no,' she said desperately, 'I cannot, I will not give him up! Your
      ladyship took him away from me alive, and gave him back to me only when he
      was dead. Now I will keep him! I am truly his widow. More truly than you,
      my lady! for I love him and mourn for him, and call myself by his dear
      name, and your ladyship does neither!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I do love him!' cries Lady Caroline with flashing eyes, 'and I cling to
      him, and won't let him go to such as you! How can I, when he is the father
      of this poor babe that's coming to me? I must have him back again! Milly,
      Milly, can't you pity and understand me, perverse girl that you are, and
      the miserable plight that I am in? Oh, this precipitancy-it is the ruin of
      women! Why did I not consider, and wait! Come, give me back all that I
      have given you, and assure me you will support me in confessing the
      truth!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never, never!' persisted Milly, with woe-begone passionateness. 'Look at
      this headstone! Look at my gown and bonnet of crape-this ring: listen to
      the name they call me by! My character is worth as much to me as yours is
      to you! After declaring my Love mine, myself his, taking his name, making
      his death my own particular sorrow, how can I say it was not so? No such
      dishonour for me! I will outswear you, my lady; and I shall be believed.
      My story is so much the more likely that yours will be thought false. But,
      O please, my lady, do not drive me to this! In pity let me keep him!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor nominal widow exhibited such anguish at a proposal which would
      have been truly a bitter humiliation to her, that Lady Caroline was warmed
      to pity in spite of her own condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, I see your position,' she answered. 'But think of mine! What can I
      do? Without your support it would seem an invention to save me from
      disgrace; even if I produced the register, the love of scandal in the
      world is such that the multitude would slur over the fact, say it was a
      fabrication, and believe your story. I do not know who were the witnesses,
      or anything!'
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes these two poor young women felt, as so many in a strait
      have felt before, that union was their greatest strength, even now; and
      they consulted calmly together. The result of their deliberations was that
      Milly went home as usual, and Lady Caroline also, the latter confessing
      that very night to the Countess her mother of the marriage, and to nobody
      else in the world. And, some time after, Lady Caroline and her mother went
      away to London, where a little while later still they were joined by
      Milly, who was supposed to have left the village to proceed to a
      watering-place in the North for the benefit of her health, at the expense
      of the ladies of the Manor, who had been much interested in her state of
      lonely and defenceless widowhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early the next year the widow Milly came home with an infant in her arms,
      the family at the Manor House having meanwhile gone abroad. They did not
      return from their tour till the autumn ensuing, by which time Milly and
      the child had again departed from the cottage of her father the woodman,
      Milly having attained to the dignity of dwelling in a cottage of her own,
      many miles to the eastward of her native village; a comfortable little
      allowance had moreover been settled on her and the child for life, through
      the instrumentality of Lady Caroline and her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two or three years passed away, and the Lady Caroline married a
      nobleman-the Marquis of Stonehenge-considerably her senior, who had wooed
      her long and phlegmatically. He was not rich, but she led a placid life
      with him for many years, though there was no child of the marriage.
      Meanwhile Milly's boy, as the youngster was called, and as Milly herself
      considered him, grew up, and throve wonderfully, and loved her as she
      deserved to be loved for her devotion to him, in whom she every day traced
      more distinctly the lineaments of the man who had won her girlish heart,
      and kept it even in the tomb.
    </p>
    <p>
      She educated him as well as she could with the limited means at her
      disposal, for the allowance had never been increased, Lady Caroline, or
      the Marchioness of Stonehenge as she now was, seeming by degrees to care
      little what had become of them. Milly became extremely ambitious on the
      boy's account; she pinched herself almost of necessaries to send him to
      the Grammar School in the town to which they retired, and at twenty he
      enlisted in a cavalry regiment, joining it with a deliberate intent of
      making the Army his profession, and not in a freak of idleness. His
      exceptional attainments, his manly bearing, his steady conduct, speedily
      won him promotion, which was furthered by the serious war in which this
      country was at that time engaged. On his return to England after the peace
      he had risen to the rank of riding-master, and was soon after advanced
      another stage, and made quartermaster, though still a young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother-his corporeal mother, that is, the Marchioness of
      Stonehenge-heard tidings of this unaided progress; it reawakened her
      maternal instincts, and filled her with pride. She became keenly
      interested in her successful soldier-son; and as she grew older much
      wished to see him again, particularly when, the Marquis dying, she was
      left a solitary and childless widow. Whether or not she would have gone to
      him of her own impulse I cannot say; but one day, when she was driving in
      an open carriage in the outskirts of a neighbouring town, the troops lying
      at the barracks hard by passed her in marching order. She eyed them
      narrowly, and in the finest of the horsemen recognized her son from his
      likeness to her first husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      This sight of him doubly intensified the motherly emotions which had lain
      dormant in her for so many years, and she wildly asked herself how she
      could so have neglected him? Had she possessed the true courage of
      affection she would have owned to her first marriage, and have reared him
      as her son! What would it have mattered if she had never obtained this
      precious coronet of pearls and gold leaves, by comparison with the gain of
      having the love and protection of such a noble and worthy son? These and
      other sad reflections cut the gloomy and solitary lady to the heart; and
      she repented of her pride in disclaiming her first husband more bitterly
      than she had ever repented of her infatuation in marrying him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her yearning was so strong, that at length it seemed to her that she could
      not live without announcing herself to him as his mother. Come what might,
      she would do it: late as it was, she would have him away from that woman
      whom she began to hate with the fierceness of a deserted heart, for having
      taken her place as the mother of her only child. She felt confidently
      enough that her son would only too gladly exchange a cottage-mother for
      one who was a peeress of the realm. Being now, in her widowhood, free to
      come and go as she chose, without question from anybody, Lady Stonehenge
      started next day for the little town where Milly yet lived, still in her
      robes of sable for the lost lover of her youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He is my son,' said the Marchioness, as soon as she was alone in the
      cottage with Milly. 'You must give him back to me, now that I am in a
      position in which I can defy the world's opinion. I suppose he comes to
      see you continually?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Every month since he returned from the war, my lady. And sometimes he
      stays two or three days, and takes me about seeing sights everywhere!' She
      spoke with quiet triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, you will have to give him up,' said the Marchioness calmly. 'It
      shall not be the worse for you-you may see him when you choose. I am going
      to avow my first marriage, and have him with me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You forget that there are two to be reckoned with, my lady. Not only me,
      but himself.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That can be arranged. You don't suppose that he wouldn't-' But not
      wishing to insult Milly by comparing their positions, she said, 'He is my
      own flesh and blood, not yours.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Flesh and blood's nothing!' said Milly, flashing with as much scorn as a
      cottager could show to a peeress, which, in this case, was not so little
      as may be supposed. 'But I will agree to put it to him, and let him settle
      it for himself.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's all I require,' said Lady Stonehenge. 'You must ask him to come,
      and I will meet him here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The soldier was written to, and the meeting took place. He was not so much
      astonished at the disclosure of his parentage as Lady Stonehenge had been
      led to expect, having known for years that there was a little mystery
      about his birth. His manner towards the Marchioness, though respectful,
      was less warm than she could have hoped. The alternatives as to his choice
      of a mother were put before him. His answer amazed and stupefied her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, my lady,' he said. 'Thank you much, but I prefer to let things be as
      they have been. My father's name is mine in any case. You see, my lady,
      you cared little for me when I was weak and helpless; why should I come to
      you now I am strong? She, dear devoted soul [pointing to Milly], tended me
      from my birth, watched over me, nursed me when I was ill, and deprived
      herself of many a little comfort to push me on. I cannot love another
      mother as I love her. She is my mother, and I will always be her son!' As
      he spoke he put his manly arm round Milly's neck, and kissed her with the
      tenderest affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      The agony of the poor Marchioness was pitiable. 'You kill me!' she said,
      between her shaking sobs. 'Cannot you-love-me-too?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, my lady. If I must say it, you were ashamed of my poor father, who
      was a sincere and honest man; therefore, I am ashamed of you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing would move him; and the suffering woman at last gasped,
      'Cannot-oh, cannot you give one kiss to me-as you did to her? It is not
      much-it is all I ask-all!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Certainly,' he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      He kissed her coldly, and the painful scene came to an end. That day was
      the beginning of death to the unfortunate Marchioness of Stonehenge. It
      was in the perverseness of her human heart that his denial of her should
      add fuel to the fire of her craving for his love. How long afterwards she
      lived I do not know with any exactness, but it was no great length of
      time. That anguish that is sharper than a serpent's tooth wore her out
      soon. Utterly reckless of the world, its ways, and its opinions, she
      allowed her story to become known; and when the welcome end supervened
      (which, I grieve to say, she refused to lighten by the consolations of
      religion), a broken heart was the truest phrase in which to sum up its
      cause.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The rural dean having concluded, some observations upon his tale were made
      in due course. The sentimental member said that Lady Caroline's history
      afforded a sad instance of how an honest human affection will become
      shamefaced and mean under the frost of class-division and social
      prejudices. She probably deserved some pity; though her offspring, before
      he grew up to man's estate, had deserved more. There was no pathos like
      the pathos of childhood, when a child found itself in a world where it was
      not wanted, and could not understand the reason why. A tale by the
      speaker, further illustrating the same subject, though with different
      results from the last, naturally followed.

      DAME THE FOURTH-LADY MOTTISFONT
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By the Sentimental Member
    </h3>
    <p>
      Of all the romantic towns in Wessex, Wintoncester is probably the most
      convenient for meditative people to live in; since there you have a
      cathedral with a nave so long that it affords space in which to walk and
      summon your remoter moods without continually turning on your heel, or
      seeming to do more than take an afternoon stroll under cover from the rain
      or sun. In an uninterrupted course of nearly three hundred steps eastward,
      and again nearly three hundred steps westward amid those magnificent
      tombs, you can, for instance, compare in the most leisurely way the dry
      dustiness which ultimately pervades the persons of kings and bishops with
      the damper dustiness that is usually the final shape of commoners,
      curates, and others who take their last rest out of doors. Then, if you
      are in love, you can, by sauntering in the chapels and behind the
      episcopal chantries with the bright-eyed one, so steep and mellow your
      ecstasy in the solemnities around, that it will assume a rarer and finer
      tincture, even more grateful to the understanding, if not to the senses,
      than that form of the emotion which arises from such companionship in
      spots where all is life, and growth, and fecundity.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in this solemn place, whither they had withdrawn from the sight of
      relatives on one cold day in March, that Sir Ashley Mottisfont asked in
      marriage, as his second wife, Philippa, the gentle daughter of plain
      Squire Okehall. Her life had been an obscure one thus far; while Sir
      Ashley, though not a rich man, had a certain distinction about him; so
      that everybody thought what a convenient, elevating, and, in a word,
      blessed match it would be for such a supernumerary as she. Nobody thought
      so more than the amiable girl herself. She had been smitten with such
      affection for him that, when she walked the cathedral aisles at his side
      on the before-mentioned day, she did not know that her feet touched hard
      pavement; it seemed to her rather that she was floating in space. Philippa
      was an ecstatic, heart-thumping maiden, and could not understand how she
      had deserved to have sent to her such an illustrious lover, such a
      travelled personage, such a handsome man.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he put the question, it was in no clumsy language, such as the
      ordinary bucolic county landlords were wont to use on like quivering
      occasions, but as elegantly as if he had been taught it in Enfield's
      Speaker. Yet he hesitated a little-for he had something to add.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My pretty Philippa,' he said (she was not very pretty by the way), 'I
      have, you must know, a little girl dependent upon me: a little waif I
      found one day in a patch of wild oats [such was this worthy baronet's
      humour] when I was riding home: a little nameless creature, whom I wish to
      take care of till she is old enough to take care of herself; and to
      educate in a plain way. She is only fifteen months old, and is at present
      in the hands of a kind villager's wife in my parish. Will you object to
      give some attention to the little thing in her helplessness?'
    </p>
    <p>
      It need hardly be said that our innocent young lady, loving him so deeply
      and joyfully as she did, replied that she would do all she could for the
      nameless child; and, shortly afterwards, the pair were married in the same
      cathedral that had echoed the whispers of his declaration, the officiating
      minister being the Bishop himself; a venerable and experienced man, so
      well accomplished in uniting people who had a mind for that sort of
      experiment, that the couple, with some sense of surprise, found themselves
      one while they were still vaguely gazing at each other as two independent
      beings.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this operation they went home to Deansleigh Park, and made a
      beginning of living happily ever after. Lady Mottisfont, true to her
      promise, was always running down to the village during the following weeks
      to see the baby whom her husband had so mysteriously lighted on during his
      ride home-concerning which interesting discovery she had her own opinion;
      but being so extremely amiable and affectionate that she could have loved
      stocks and stones if there had been no living creatures to love, she
      uttered none of her thoughts. The little thing, who had been christened
      Dorothy, took to Lady Mottisfont as if the baronet's young wife had been
      her mother; and at length Philippa grew so fond of the child that she
      ventured to ask her husband if she might have Dorothy in her own home, and
      bring her up carefully, just as if she were her own. To this he answered
      that, though remarks might be made thereon, he had no objection; a fact
      which was obvious, Sir Ashley seeming rather pleased than otherwise with
      the proposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this they lived quietly and uneventfully for two or three years at
      Sir Ashley Mottisfont's residence in that part of England, with as near an
      approach to bliss as the climate of this country allows. The child had
      been a godsend to Philippa, for there seemed no great probability of her
      having one of her own: and she wisely regarded the possession of Dorothy
      as a special kindness of Providence, and did not worry her mind at all as
      to Dorothy's possible origin. Being a tender and impulsive creature, she
      loved her husband without criticism, exhaustively and religiously, and the
      child not much otherwise. She watched the little foundling as if she had
      been her own by nature, and Dorothy became a great solace to her when her
      husband was absent on pleasure or business; and when he came home he
      looked pleased to see how the two had won each other's hearts. Sir Ashley
      would kiss his wife, and his wife would kiss little Dorothy, and little
      Dorothy would kiss Sir Ashley, and after this triangular burst of
      affection Lady Mottisfont would say, 'Dear me-I forget she is not mine!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What does it matter?' her husband would reply. 'Providence is fore-
      knowing. He has sent us this one because he is not intending to send us
      one by any other channel.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Their life was of the simplest. Since his travels the baronet had taken to
      sporting and farming; while Philippa was a pattern of domesticity. Their
      pleasures were all local. They retired early to rest, and rose with the
      cart-horses and whistling waggoners. They knew the names of every bird and
      tree not exceptionally uncommon, and could foretell the weather almost as
      well as anxious farmers and old people with corns.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day Sir Ashley Mottisfont received a letter, which he read, and
      musingly laid down on the table without remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What is it, dearest?' asked his wife, glancing at the sheet.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, it is from an old lawyer at Bath whom I used to know. He reminds me
      of something I said to him four or five years ago-some little time before
      we were married-about Dorothy.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What about her?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It was a casual remark I made to him, when I thought you might not take
      kindly to her, that if he knew a lady who was anxious to adopt a child,
      and could insure a good home to Dorothy, he was to let me know.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But that was when you had nobody to take care of her,' she said quickly.
      'How absurd of him to write now! Does he know you are married? He must,
      surely.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh yes!'
    </p>
    <p>
      He handed her the letter. The solicitor stated that a widow-lady of
      position, who did not at present wish her name to be disclosed, had lately
      become a client of his while taking the waters, and had mentioned to him
      that she would like a little girl to bring up as her own, if she could be
      certain of finding one of good and pleasing disposition; and, the better
      to insure this, she would not wish the child to be too young for judging
      her qualities. He had remembered Sir Ashley's observation to him a long
      while ago, and therefore brought the matter before him. It would be an
      excellent home for the little girl-of that he was positive-if she had not
      already found such a home.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But it is absurd of the man to write so long after!' said Lady
      Mottisfont, with a lumpiness about the back of her throat as she thought
      how much Dorothy had become to her. 'I suppose it was when you first-found
      her-that you told him this?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Exactly-it was then.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He fell into thought, and neither Sir Ashley nor Lady Mottisfont took the
      trouble to answer the lawyer's letter; and so the matter ended for the
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day at dinner, on their return from a short absence in town, whither
      they had gone to see what the world was doing, hear what it was saying,
      and to make themselves generally fashionable after rusticating for so
      long-on this occasion, I say, they learnt from some friend who had joined
      them at dinner that Fernell Hall-the manorial house of the estate next
      their own, which had been offered on lease by reason of the impecuniosity
      of its owner-had been taken for a term by a widow lady, an Italian
      Contessa, whose name I will not mention for certain reasons which may by
      and by appear. Lady Mottisfont expressed her surprise and interest at the
      probability of having such a neighbour. 'Though, if I had been born in
      Italy, I think I should have liked to remain there,' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'She is not Italian, though her husband was,' said Sir Ashley.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, you have heard about her before now?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes; they were talking of her at Grey's the other evening. She is
      English.' And then, as her husband said no more about the lady, the friend
      who was dining with them told Lady Mottisfont that the Countess's father
      had speculated largely in East-India Stock, in which immense fortunes were
      being made at that time; through this his daughter had found herself
      enormously wealthy at his death, which had occurred only a few weeks after
      the death of her husband. It was supposed that the marriage of an
      enterprising English speculator's daughter to a poor foreign nobleman had
      been matter of arrangement merely. As soon as the Countess's widowhood was
      a little further advanced she would, no doubt, be the mark of all the
      schemers who came near her, for she was still quite young. But at present
      she seemed to desire quiet, and avoided society and town.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some weeks after this time Sir Ashley Mottisfont sat looking fixedly at
      his lady for many moments. He said:
    </p>
    <p>
      'It might have been better for Dorothy if the Countess had taken her. She
      is so wealthy in comparison with ourselves, and could have ushered the
      girl into the great world more effectually than we ever shall be able to
      do.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The Contessa take Dorothy?' said Lady Mottisfont with a start. 'What-was
      she the lady who wished to adopt her?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes; she was staying at Bath when Lawyer Gayton wrote to me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But how do you know all this, Ashley?'
    </p>
    <p>
      He showed a little hesitation. 'Oh, I've seen her,' he says. 'You know,
      she drives to the meet sometimes, though she does not ride; and she has
      informed me that she was the lady who inquired of Gayton.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You have talked to her as well as seen her, then?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh yes, several times; everybody has.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why didn't you tell me?' says his lady. 'I had quite forgotten to call
      upon her. I'll go to-morrow, or soon . . . But I can't think, Ashley, how
      you can say that it might have been better for Dorothy to have gone to
      her; she is so much our own now that I cannot admit any such conjectures
      as those, even in jest.' Her eyes reproached him so eloquently that Sir
      Ashley Mottisfont did not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Mottisfont did not hunt any more than the Anglo-Italian Countess did;
      indeed, she had become so absorbed in household matters and in Dorothy's
      wellbeing that she had no mind to waste a minute on mere enjoyments. As
      she had said, to talk coolly of what might have been the best destination
      in days past for a child to whom they had become so attached seemed quite
      barbarous, and she could not understand how her husband should consider
      the point so abstractedly; for, as will probably have been guessed, Lady
      Mottisfont long before this time, if she had not done so at the very
      beginning, divined Sir Ashley's true relation to Dorothy. But the
      baronet's wife was so discreetly meek and mild that she never told him of
      her surmise, and took what Heaven had sent her without cavil, her
      generosity in this respect having been bountifully rewarded by the new
      life she found in her love for the little girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband recurred to the same uncomfortable subject when, a few days
      later, they were speaking of travelling abroad. He said that it was almost
      a pity, if they thought of going, that they had not fallen in with the
      Countess's wish. That lady had told him that she had met Dorothy walking
      with her nurse, and that she had never seen a child she liked so well.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What-she covets her still? How impertinent of the woman!' said Lady
      Mottisfont.
    </p>
    <p>
      'She seems to do so . . . You see, dearest Philippa, the advantage to
      Dorothy would have been that the Countess would have adopted her legally,
      and have made her as her own daughter; while we have not done that-we are
      only bringing up and educating a poor child in charity.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But I'll adopt her fully-make her mine legally!' cried his wife in an
      anxious voice. 'How is it to be done?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'H'm.' He did not inform her, but fell into thought; and, for reasons of
      her own, his lady was restless and uneasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The very next day Lady Mottisfont drove to Fernell Hall to pay the
      neglected call upon her neighbour. The Countess was at home, and received
      her graciously. But poor Lady Mottisfont's heart died within her as soon
      as she set eyes on her new acquaintance. Such wonderful beauty, of the
      fully-developed kind, had never confronted her before inside the lines of
      a human face. She seemed to shine with every light and grace that woman
      can possess. Her finished Continental manners, her expanded mind, her
      ready wit, composed a study that made the other poor lady sick; for she,
      and latterly Sir Ashley himself, were rather rural in manners, and she
      felt abashed by new sounds and ideas from without. She hardly knew three
      words in any language but her own, while this divine creature, though
      truly English, had, apparently, whatever she wanted in the Italian and
      French tongues to suit every impression; which was considered a great
      improvement to speech in those days, and, indeed, is by many considered as
      such in these.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How very strange it was about the little girl!' the Contessa said to Lady
      Mottisfont, in her gay tones. 'I mean, that the child the lawyer
      recommended should, just before then, have been adopted by you, who are
      now my neighbour. How is she getting on? I must come and see her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you still want her?' asks Lady Mottisfont suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, I should like to have her!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But you can't! She's mine!' said the other greedily.
    </p>
    <p>
      A drooping manner appeared in the Countess from that moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Mottisfont, too, was in a wretched mood all the way home that day.
      The Countess was so charming in every way that she had charmed her gentle
      ladyship; how should it be possible that she had failed to charm Sir
      Ashley? Moreover, she had awakened a strange thought in Philippa's mind.
      As soon as she reached home she rushed to the nursery, and there, seizing
      Dorothy, frantically kissed her; then, holding her at arm's length, she
      gazed with a piercing inquisitiveness into the girl's lineaments. She
      sighed deeply, abandoned the wondering Dorothy, and hastened away.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had seen there not only her husband's traits, which she had often
      beheld before, but others, of the shade, shape, and expression which
      characterized those of her new neighbour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then this poor lady perceived the whole perturbing sequence of things, and
      asked herself how she could have been such a walking piece of simplicity
      as not to have thought of this before. But she did not stay long
      upbraiding herself for her shortsightedness, so overwhelmed was she with
      misery at the spectacle of herself as an intruder between these. To be
      sure she could not have foreseen such a conjuncture; but that did not
      lessen her grief. The woman who had been both her husband's bliss and his
      backsliding had reappeared free when he was no longer so, and she
      evidently was dying to claim her own in the person of Dorothy, who had
      meanwhile grown to be, to Lady Mottisfont, almost the only source of each
      day's happiness, supplying her with something to watch over, inspiring her
      with the sense of maternity, and so largely reflecting her husband's
      nature as almost to deceive her into the pleasant belief that she
      reflected her own also.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there was a single direction in which this devoted and virtuous lady
      erred, it was in the direction of over-submissiveness. When all is said
      and done, and the truth told, men seldom show much self-sacrifice in their
      conduct as lords and masters to helpless women bound to them for life, and
      perhaps (though I say it with all uncertainty) if she had blazed up in his
      face like a furze-faggot, directly he came home, she might have helped
      herself a little. But God knows whether this is a true supposition; at any
      rate she did no such thing; and waited and prayed that she might never do
      despite to him who, she was bound to admit, had always been tender and
      courteous towards her; and hoped that little Dorothy might never be taken
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      By degrees the two households became friendly, and very seldom did a week
      pass without their seeing something of each other. Try as she might, and
      dangerous as she assumed the acquaintanceship to be, Lady Mottisfont could
      detect no fault or flaw in her new friend. It was obvious that Dorothy had
      been the magnet which had drawn the Contessa hither, and not Sir Ashley.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such beauty, united with such understanding and brightness, Philippa had
      never before known in one of her own sex, and she tried to think (whether
      she succeeded I do not know) that she did not mind the propinquity; since
      a woman so rich, so fair, and with such a command of suitors, could not
      desire to wreck the happiness of so inoffensive a person as herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The season drew on when it was the custom for families of distinction to
      go off to The Bath, and Sir Ashley Mottisfont persuaded his wife to
      accompany him thither with Dorothy. Everybody of any note was there this
      year. From their own part of England came many that they knew; among the
      rest, Lord and Lady Purbeck, the Earl and Countess of Wessex, Sir John
      Grebe, the Drenkhards, Lady Stourvale, the old Duke of Hamptonshire, the
      Bishop of Melchester, the Dean of Exonbury, and other lesser lights of
      Court, pulpit, and field. Thither also came the fair Contessa, whom, as
      soon as Philippa saw how much she was sought after by younger men, she
      could not conscientiously suspect of renewed designs upon Sir Ashley.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Countess had finer opportunities than ever with Dorothy; for Lady
      Mottisfont was often indisposed, and even at other times could not
      honestly hinder an intercourse which gave bright ideas to the child.
      Dorothy welcomed her new acquaintance with a strange and instinctive
      readiness that intimated the wonderful subtlety of the threads which bind
      flesh and flesh together.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the crisis came: it was precipitated by an accident. Dorothy and
      her nurse had gone out one day for an airing, leaving Lady Mottisfont
      alone indoors. While she sat gloomily thinking that in all likelihood the
      Countess would contrive to meet the child somewhere, and exchange a few
      tender words with her, Sir Ashley Mottisfont rushed in and informed her
      that Dorothy had just had the narrowest possible escape from death. Some
      workmen were undermining a house to pull it down for rebuilding, when,
      without warning, the front wall inclined slowly outwards for its fall, the
      nurse and child passing beneath it at the same moment. The fall was
      temporarily arrested by the scaffolding, while in the meantime the
      Countess had witnessed their imminent danger from the other side of the
      street. Springing across, she snatched Dorothy from under the wall, and
      pulled the nurse after her, the middle of the way being barely reached
      before they were enveloped in the dense dust of the descending mass,
      though not a stone touched them.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Where is Dorothy?' says the excited Lady Mottisfont.
    </p>
    <p>
      'She has her-she won't let her go for a time-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Has her? But she's mine-she's mine!' cries Lady Mottisfont.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then her quick and tender eyes perceived that her husband had almost
      forgotten her intrusive existence in contemplating the oneness of
      Dorothy's, the Countess's, and his own: he was in a dream of exaltation
      which recognized nothing necessary to his well-being outside that welded
      circle of three lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dorothy was at length brought home; she was much fascinated by the
      Countess, and saw nothing tragic, but rather all that was truly
      delightful, in what had happened. In the evening, when the excitement was
      over, and Dorothy was put to bed, Sir Ashley said, 'She has saved Dorothy;
      and I have been asking myself what I can do for her as a slight
      acknowledgment of her heroism. Surely we ought to let her have Dorothy to
      bring up, since she still desires to do it? It would be so much to
      Dorothy's advantage. We ought to look at it in that light, and not
      selfishly.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Philippa seized his hand. 'Ashley, Ashley! You don't mean it-that I must
      lose my pretty darling-the only one I have?' She met his gaze with her
      piteous mouth and wet eyes so painfully strained, that he turned away his
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, before Dorothy was awake, Lady Mottisfont stole to the
      girl's bedside, and sat regarding her. When Dorothy opened her eyes, she
      fixed them for a long time upon Philippa's features.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mamma-you are not so pretty as the Contessa, are you?' she said at
      length.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am not, Dorothy.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why are you not, mamma?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dorothy-where would you rather live, always; with me, or with her?'
    </p>
    <p>
      The little girl looked troubled. 'I am sorry, mamma; I don't mean to be
      unkind; but I would rather live with her; I mean, if I might without
      trouble, and you did not mind, and it could be just the same to us all,
      you know.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Has she ever asked you the same question?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never, mamma.'
    </p>
    <p>
      There lay the sting of it: the Countess seemed the soul of honour and
      fairness in this matter, test her as she might. That afternoon Lady
      Mottisfont went to her husband with singular firmness upon her gentle
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ashley, we have been married nearly five years, and I have never
      challenged you with what I know perfectly well-the parentage of Dorothy.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never have you, Philippa dear. Though I have seen that you knew from the
      first.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'From the first as to her father, not as to her mother. Her I did not know
      for some time; but I know now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah! you have discovered that too?' says he, without much surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Could I help it? Very well, that being so, I have thought it over; and I
      have spoken to Dorothy. I agree to her going. I can do no less than grant
      to the Countess her wish, after her kindness to my-your-her-child.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Then this self-sacrificing woman went hastily away that he might not see
      that her heart was bursting; and thereupon, before they left the city,
      Dorothy changed her mother and her home. After this, the Countess went
      away to London for a while, taking Dorothy with her; and the baronet and
      his wife returned to their lonely place at Deansleigh Park without her.
    </p>
    <p>
      To renounce Dorothy in the bustle of Bath was a different thing from
      living without her in this quiet home. One evening Sir Ashley missed his
      wife from the supper-table; her manner had been so pensive and woeful of
      late that he immediately became alarmed. He said nothing, but looked about
      outside the house narrowly, and discerned her form in the park, where
      recently she had been accustomed to walk alone. In its lower levels there
      was a pool fed by a trickling brook, and he reached this spot in time to
      hear a splash. Running forward, he dimly perceived her light gown floating
      in the water. To pull her out was the work of a few instants, and bearing
      her indoors to her room, he undressed her, nobody in the house knowing of
      the incident but himself. She had not been immersed long enough to lose
      her senses, and soon recovered. She owned that she had done it because the
      Contessa had taken away her child, as she persisted in calling Dorothy.
      Her husband spoke sternly to her, and impressed upon her the weakness of
      giving way thus, when all that had happened was for the best. She took his
      reproof meekly, and admitted her fault.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that she became more resigned, but he often caught her in tears over
      some doll, shoe, or ribbon of Dorothy's, and decided to take her to the
      North of England for change of air and scene. This was not without its
      beneficial effect, corporeally no less than mentally, as later events
      showed, but she still evinced a preternatural sharpness of ear at the most
      casual mention of the child. When they reached home, the Countess and
      Dorothy were still absent from the neighbouring Fernell Hall, but in a
      month or two they returned, and a little later Sir Ashley Mottisfont came
      into his wife's room full of news.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well-would you think it, Philippa! After being so desperate, too, about
      getting Dorothy to be with her!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah-what?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Our neighbour, the Countess, is going to be married again! It is to
      somebody she has met in London.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Mottisfont was much surprised; she had never dreamt of such an event.
      The conflict for the possession of Dorothy's person had obscured the
      possibility of it; yet what more likely, the Countess being still under
      thirty, and so good-looking?
    </p>
    <p>
      'What is of still more interest to us, or to you,' continued her husband,
      'is a kind offer she has made. She is willing that you should have Dorothy
      back again. Seeing what a grief the loss of her has been to you, she will
      try to do without her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is not for that; it is not to oblige me,' said Lady Mottisfont
      quickly. 'One can see well enough what it is for!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, never mind; beggars mustn't be choosers. The reason or motive is
      nothing to us, so that you obtain your desire.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am not a beggar any longer,' said Lady Mottisfont, with proud mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What do you mean by that?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Mottisfont hesitated. However, it was only too plain that she did not
      now jump at a restitution of one for whom some months before she had been
      breaking her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The explanation of this change of mood became apparent some little time
      farther on. Lady Mottisfont, after five years of wedded life, was
      expecting to become a mother, and the aspect of many things was greatly
      altered in her view. Among the more important changes was that of no
      longer feeling Dorothy to be absolutely indispensable to her existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, in view of her coming marriage, the Countess decided to abandon
      the remainder of her term at Fernell Hall, and return to her pretty little
      house in town. But she could not do this quite so quickly as she had
      expected, and half a year or more elapsed before she finally quitted the
      neighbourhood, the interval being passed in alternations between the
      country and London. Prior to her last departure she had an interview with
      Sir Ashley Mottisfont, and it occurred three days after his wife had
      presented him with a son and heir.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I wanted to speak to you,' said the Countess, looking him luminously in
      the face, 'about the dear foundling I have adopted temporarily, and
      thought to have adopted permanently. But my marriage makes it too risky!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I thought it might be that,' he answered, regarding her steadfastly back
      again, and observing two tears come slowly into her eyes as she heard her
      own voice describe Dorothy in those words.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't criticize me,' she said hastily; and recovering herself, went on.
      'If Lady Mottisfont could take her back again, as I suggested, it would be
      better for me, and certainly no worse for Dorothy. To every one but
      ourselves she is but a child I have taken a fancy to, and Lady Mottisfont
      coveted her so much, and was very reluctant to let her go . . . I am sure
      she will adopt her again?' she added anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will sound her afresh,' said the baronet. 'You leave Dorothy behind for
      the present?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes; although I go away, I do not give up the house for another month.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not speak to his wife about the proposal till some few days after,
      when Lady Mottisfont had nearly recovered, and news of the Countess's
      marriage in London had just reached them. He had no sooner mentioned
      Dorothy's name than Lady Mottisfont showed symptoms of disquietude.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have not acquired any dislike of Dorothy,' she said, 'but I feel that
      there is one nearer to me now. Dorothy chose the alternative of going to
      the Countess, you must remember, when I put it to her as between the
      Countess and myself.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But, my dear Philippa, how can you argue thus about a child, and that
      child our Dorothy?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not ours,' said his wife, pointing to the cot. 'Ours is here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What, then, Philippa,' he said, surprised, 'you won't have her back,
      after nearly dying of grief at the loss of her?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I cannot argue, dear Ashley. I should prefer not to have the
      responsibility of Dorothy again. Her place is filled now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband sighed, and went out of the chamber. There had been a previous
      arrangement that Dorothy should be brought to the house on a visit that
      day, but instead of taking her up to his wife, he did not inform Lady
      Mottisfont of the child's presence. He entertained her himself as well as
      he could, and accompanied her into the park, where they had a ramble
      together. Presently he sat down on the root of an elm and took her upon
      his knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Between this husband and this baby, little Dorothy, you who had two homes
      are left out in the cold,' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Can't I go to London with my pretty mamma?' said Dorothy, perceiving from
      his manner that there was a hitch somewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am afraid not, my child. She only took you to live with her because she
      was lonely, you know.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then can't I stay at Deansleigh Park with my other mamma and you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am afraid that cannot be done either,' said he sadly. 'We have a baby
      in the house now.' He closed the reply by stooping down and kissing her,
      there being a tear in his eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then nobody wants me!' said Dorothy pathetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh yes, somebody wants you,' he assured her. 'Where would you like to
      live besides?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Dorothy's experiences being rather limited, she mentioned the only other
      place in the world that she was acquainted with, the cottage of the
      villager who had taken care of her before Lady Mottisfont had removed her
      to the Manor House.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes; that's where you'll be best off and most independent,' he answered.
      'And I'll come to see you, my dear girl, and bring you pretty things; and
      perhaps you'll be just as happy there.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, when the change came, and Dorothy was handed over to the
      kind cottage-woman, the poor child missed the luxurious roominess of
      Fernell Hall and Deansleigh; and for a long time her little feet, which
      had been accustomed to carpets and oak floors, suffered from the cold of
      the stone flags on which it was now her lot to live and to play; while
      chilblains came upon her fingers with washing at the pump. But thicker
      shoes with nails in them somewhat remedied the cold feet, and her
      complaints and tears on this and other scores diminished to silence as she
      became inured anew to the hardships of the farm-cottage, and she grew up
      robust if not handsome. She was never altogether lost sight of by Sir
      Ashley, though she was deprived of the systematic education which had been
      devised and begun for her by Lady Mottisfont, as well as by her other
      mamma, the enthusiastic Countess. The latter soon had other Dorothys to
      think of, who occupied her time and affection as fully as Lady
      Mottisfont's were occupied by her precious boy. In the course of time the
      doubly-desired and doubly-rejected Dorothy married, I believe, a
      respectable road-contractor-the same, if I mistake not, who repaired and
      improved the old highway running from Wintoncester south-westerly through
      the New Forest-and in the heart of this worthy man of business the poor
      girl found the nest which had been denied her by her own flesh and blood
      of higher degree.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Several of the listeners wished to hear another story from the sentimental
      member after this, but he said that he could recall nothing else at the
      moment, and that it seemed to him as if his friend on the other side of
      the fireplace had something to say from the look of his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      The member alluded to was a respectable churchwarden, with a sly chink to
      one eyelid-possibly the result of an accident-and a regular attendant at
      the Club meetings. He replied that his looks had been mainly caused by his
      interest in the two ladies of the last story, apparently women of strong
      motherly instincts, even though they were not genuinely staunch in their
      tenderness. The tale had brought to his mind an instance of a firmer
      affection of that sort on the paternal side, in a nature otherwise
      culpable. As for telling the story, his manner was much against him, he
      feared; but he would do his best, if they wished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the President interposed with a suggestion that as it was getting
      late in the afternoon it would be as well to adjourn to their respective
      inns and lodgings for dinner, after which those who cared to do so could
      return and resume these curious domestic traditions for the remainder of
      the evening, which might otherwise prove irksome enough. The curator had
      told him that the room was at their service. The churchwarden, who was
      beginning to feel hungry himself, readily acquiesced, and the Club
      separated for an hour and a half. Then the faithful ones began to drop in
      again-among whom were not the President; neither came the rural dean, nor
      the two curates, though the Colonel, and the man of family, cigars in
      mouth, were good enough to return, having found their hotel dreary. The
      museum had no regular means of illumination, and a solitary candle, less
      powerful than the rays of the fire, was placed on the table; also bottles
      and glasses, provided by some thoughtful member. The chink-eyed
      churchwarden, now thoroughly primed, proceeded to relate in his own terms
      what was in substance as follows, while many of his listeners smoked.

    <h2>
      DAME THE FIFTH-THE LADY ICENWAY
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By the Churchwarden
    </h3>
    <p>
      In the reign of His Most Excellent Majesty King George the Third, Defender
      of the Faith and of the American Colonies, there lived in 'a faire
      maner-place' (so Leland called it in his day, as I have been told), in one
      o' the greenest bits of woodland between Bristol and the city of Exonbury,
      a young lady who resembled some aforesaid ones in having many talents and
      exceeding great beauty. With these gifts she combined a somewhat imperious
      temper and arbitrary mind, though her experience of the world was not
      actually so large as her conclusive manner would have led the stranger to
      suppose. Being an orphan, she resided with her uncle, who, though he was
      fairly considerate as to her welfare, left her pretty much to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it chanced that when this lovely young lady was about nineteen, she
      (being a fearless horsewoman) was riding, with only a young lad as an
      attendant, in one o' the woods near her uncle's house, and, in trotting
      along, her horse stumbled over the root of a felled tree. She slipped to
      the ground, not seriously hurt, and was assisted home by a gentleman who
      came in view at the moment of her mishap. It turned out that this
      gentleman, a total stranger to her, was on a visit at the house of a
      neighbouring landowner. He was of Dutch extraction, and occasionally came
      to England on business or pleasure from his plantations in Guiana, on the
      north coast of South America, where he usually resided.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this account he was naturally but little known in Wessex, and was but a
      slight acquaintance of the gentleman at whose mansion he was a guest.
      However, the friendship between him and the Heymeres-as the uncle and
      niece were named-warmed and warmed by degrees, there being but few folk o'
      note in the vicinity at that time, which made a newcomer, if he were at
      all sociable and of good credit, always sure of a welcome. A tender
      feeling (as it is called by the romantic) sprang up between the two young
      people, which ripened into intimacy. Anderling, the foreign gentleman, was
      of an amorous temperament; and, though he endeavoured to conceal his
      feeling, it could be seen that Miss Maria Heymere had impressed him rather
      more deeply than would be represented by a scratch upon a stone. He seemed
      absolutely unable to free himself from her fascination; and his inability
      to do so, much as he tried-evidently thinking he had not the ghost of a
      chance with her-gave her the pleasure of power; though she more than
      sympathized when she overheard him heaving his deep drawn sighs-privately
      to himself, as he supposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      After prolonging his visit by every conceivable excuse in his power, he
      summoned courage, and offered her his hand and his heart. Being in no way
      disinclined to him, though not so fervid as he, and her uncle making no
      objection to the match, she consented to share his fate, for better or
      otherwise, in the distant colony where, as he assured her, his rice, and
      coffee, and maize, and timber, produced him ample means-a statement which
      was borne out by his friend, her uncle's neighbour. In short, a day for
      their marriage was fixed, earlier in the engagement than is usual or
      desirable between comparative strangers, by reason of the necessity he was
      under of returning to look after his properties.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wedding took place, and Maria left her uncle's mansion with her
      husband, going in the first place to London, and about a fortnight after
      sailing with him across the great ocean for their distant home-which,
      however, he assured her, should not be her home for long, it being his
      intention to dispose of his interests in this part of the world as soon as
      the war was over, and he could do so advantageously; when they could come
      to Europe, and reside in some favourite capital.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they advanced on the voyage she observed that he grew more and more
      constrained; and, by the time they had crossed the Line, he was quite
      depressed, just as he had been before proposing to her. A day or two
      before landing at Paramaribo, he embraced her in a very tearful and
      passionate manner, and said he wished to make a confession. It had been
      his misfortune, he said, to marry at Quebec in early life a woman whose
      reputation proved to be in every way bad and scandalous. The discovery had
      nearly killed him; but he had ultimately separated from her, and had never
      seen her since. He had hoped and prayed she might be dead; but recently in
      London, when they were starting on this journey, he had discovered that
      she was still alive. At first he had decided to keep this dark
      intelligence from her beloved ears; but he had felt that he could not do
      it. All he hoped was that such a condition of things would make no
      difference in her feelings for him, as it need make no difference in the
      course of their lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon the spirit of this proud and masterful lady showed itself in
      violent turmoil, like the raging of a nor'-west thunderstorm-as well it
      might, God knows. But she was of too stout a nature to be broken down by
      his revelation, as many ladies of my acquaintance would have been-so far
      from home, and right under the Line in the blaze o' the sun. Of the two,
      indeed, he was the more wretched and shattered in spirit, for he loved her
      deeply, and (there being a foreign twist in his make) had been tempted to
      this crime by her exceeding beauty, against which he had struggled day and
      night, till he had no further resistance left in him. It was she who came
      first to a decision as to what should be done-whether a wise one I do not
      attempt to judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I put it to you,' says she, when many useless self-reproaches and
      protestations on his part had been uttered-'I put it to you whether, if
      any manliness is left in you, you ought not to do exactly what I consider
      the best thing for me in this strait to which you have reduced me?'
    </p>
    <p>
      He promised to do anything in the whole world. She then requested him to
      allow her to return, and announce him as having died of malignant ague
      immediately on their arrival at Paramaribo; that she should consequently
      appear in weeds as his widow in her native place; and that he would never
      molest her, or come again to that part of the world during the whole
      course of his life-a good reason for which would be that the legal
      consequences might be serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      He readily acquiesced in this, as he would have acquiesced in anything for
      the restitution of one he adored so deeply-even to the yielding of life
      itself. To put her in an immediate state of independence he gave her, in
      bonds and jewels, a considerable sum (for his worldly means had been in no
      way exaggerated); and by the next ship she sailed again for England,
      having travelled no farther than to Paramaribo. At parting he declared it
      to be his intention to turn all his landed possessions into personal
      property, and to be a wanderer on the face of the earth in remorse for his
      conduct towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maria duly arrived in England, and immediately on landing apprised her
      uncle of her return, duly appearing at his house in the garb of a widow.
      She was commiserated by all the neighbours as soon as her story was told;
      but only to her uncle did she reveal the real state of affairs, and her
      reason for concealing it. For, though she had been innocent of wrong,
      Maria's pride was of that grain which could not brook the least appearance
      of having been fooled, or deluded, or nonplussed in her worldly aims.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some time she led a quiet life with her relative, and in due course a
      son was born to her. She was much respected for her dignity and reserve,
      and the portable wealth which her temporary husband had made over to her
      enabled her to live in comfort in a wing of the mansion, without
      assistance from her uncle at all. But, knowing that she was not what she
      seemed to be, her life was an uneasy one, and she often said to herself:
      'Suppose his continued existence should become known here, and people
      should discern the pride of my motive in hiding my humiliation? It would
      be worse than if I had been frank at first, which I should have been but
      for the credit of this child.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Such grave reflections as these occupied her with increasing force; and
      during their continuance she encountered a worthy man of noble birth and
      title-Lord Icenway his name-whose seat was beyond Wintoncester, quite at
      t'other end of Wessex. He being anxious to pay his addresses to her, Maria
      willingly accepted them, though he was a plain man, older than herself;
      for she discerned in a re-marriage a method of fortifying her position
      against mortifying discoveries. In a few months their union took place,
      and Maria lifted her head as Lady Icenway, and left with her husband and
      child for his home as aforesaid, where she was quite unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      A justification, or a condemnation, of her step (according as you view it)
      was seen when, not long after, she received a note from her former husband
      Anderling. It was a hasty and tender epistle, and perhaps it was fortunate
      that it arrived during the temporary absence of Lord Icenway. His
      worthless wife, said Anderling, had just died in Quebec; he had gone there
      to ascertain particulars, and had seen the unfortunate woman buried. He
      now was hastening to England to repair the wrong he had done his Maria. He
      asked her to meet him at Southampton, his port of arrival; which she need
      be in no fear of doing, as he had changed his name, and was almost
      absolutely unknown in Europe. He would remarry her immediately, and live
      with her in any part of the Continent, as they had originally intended,
      where, for the great love he still bore her, he would devote himself to
      her service for the rest of his days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Icenway, self-possessed as it was her nature to be, was yet much
      disturbed at this news, and set off to meet him, unattended, as soon as
      she heard that the ship was in sight. As soon as they stood face to face
      she found that she still possessed all her old influence over him, though
      his power to fascinate her had quite departed. In his sorrow for his
      offence against her, he had become a man of strict religious habits,
      self-denying as a lenten saint, though formerly he had been a free and
      joyous liver. Having first got him to swear to make her any amends she
      should choose (which he was imagining must be by a true marriage), she
      informed him that she had already wedded another husband, an excellent man
      of ancient family and possessions, who had given her a title, in which she
      much rejoiced.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this the countenance of the poor foreign gentleman became cold as clay,
      and his heart withered within him; for as it had been her beauty and
      bearing which had led him to sin to obtain her, so, now that her beauty
      was in fuller bloom, and her manner more haughty by her success, did he
      feel her fascination to be almost more than he could bear. Nevertheless,
      having sworn his word, he undertook to obey her commands, which were
      simply a renewal of her old request-that he would depart for some foreign
      country, and never reveal his existence to her friends, or husband, or any
      person in England; never trouble her more, seeing how great a harm it
      would do her in the high position which she at present occupied.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bowed his head. 'And the child-our child?' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He is well,' says she. 'Quite well.'
    </p>
    <p>
      With this the unhappy gentleman departed, much sadder in his heart than on
      his voyage to England; for it had never occurred to him that a woman who
      rated her honour so highly as Maria had done, and who was the mother of a
      child of his, would have adopted such means as this for the restoration of
      that honour, and at so surprisingly early a date. He had fully calculated
      on making her his wife in law and truth, and of living in cheerful unity
      with her and his offspring, for whom he felt a deep and growing
      tenderness, though he had never once seen the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady returned to her mansion beyond Wintoncester, and told nothing of
      the interview to her noble husband, who had fortunately gone that day to
      do a little cocking and ratting out by Weydon Priors, and knew nothing of
      her movements. She had dismissed her poor Anderling peremptorily enough;
      yet she would often after this look in the face of the child of her
      so-called widowhood, to discover what and how many traits of his father
      were to be seen in his lineaments. For this she had ample opportunity
      during the following autumn and winter months, her husband being a
      matter-of-fact nobleman, who spent the greater part of his time in
      field-sports and agriculture.
    </p>
    <p>
      One winter day, when he had started for a meet of the hounds a long way
      from the house-it being his custom to hunt three or four times a week at
      this season of the year-she had walked into the sunshine upon the terrace
      before the windows, where there fell at her feet some little white object
      that had come over a boundary wall hard by. It proved to be a tiny note
      wrapped round a stone. Lady Icenway opened it and read it, and immediately
      (no doubt, with a stern fixture of her queenly countenance) walked hastily
      along the terrace, and through the door into the shrubbery, whence the
      note had come. The man who had first married her stood under the bushes
      before her. It was plain from his appearance that something had gone wrong
      with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You notice a change in me, my best-beloved,' he said. 'Yes, Maria-I have
      lost all the wealth I once possessed-mainly by reckless gambling in the
      Continental hells to which you banished me. But one thing in the world
      remains to me-the child-and it is for him that I have intruded here. Don't
      fear me, darling! I shall not inconvenience you long; I love you too well!
      But I think of the boy day and night-I cannot help it-I cannot keep my
      feeling for him down; and I long to see him, and speak a word to him once
      in my lifetime!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But your oath?' says she. 'You promised never to reveal by word or sign-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will reveal nothing. Only let me see the child. I know what I have
      sworn to you, cruel mistress, and I respect my oath. Otherwise I might
      have seen him by some subterfuge. But I preferred the frank course of
      asking your permission.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She demurred, with the haughty severity which had grown part of her
      character, and which her elevation to the rank of a peeress had rather
      intensified than diminished. She said that she would consider, and would
      give him an answer the day after the next, at the same hour and place,
      when her husband would again be absent with his pack of hounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman waited patiently. Lady Icenway, who had now no conscious
      love left for him, well considered the matter, and felt that it would be
      advisable not to push to extremes a man of so passionate a heart. On the
      day and hour she met him as she had promised to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You shall see him,' she said, 'of course on the strict condition that you
      do not reveal yourself, and hence, though you see him, he must not see
      you, or your manner might betray you and me. I will lull him into a nap in
      the afternoon, and then I will come to you here, and fetch you indoors by
      a private way.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The unfortunate father, whose misdemeanour had recoiled upon his own head
      in a way he could not have foreseen, promised to adhere to her
      instructions, and waited in the shrubberies till the moment when she
      should call him. This she duly did about three o'clock that day, leading
      him in by a garden door, and upstairs to the nursery where the child lay.
      He was in his little cot, breathing calmly, his arm thrown over his head,
      and his silken curls crushed into the pillow. His father, now almost to be
      pitied, bent over him, and a tear from his eye wetted the coverlet.
    </p>
    <p>
      She held up a warning finger as he lowered his mouth to the lips of the
      boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But oh, why not?' implored he.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very well, then,' said she, relenting. 'But as gently as possible.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He kissed the child without waking him, turned, gave him a last look, and
      followed her out of the chamber, when she conducted him off the premises
      by the way he had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this remedy for his sadness of heart at being a stranger to his own
      son, had the effect of intensifying the malady; for while originally, not
      knowing or having ever seen the boy, he had loved him vaguely and
      imaginatively only, he now became attached to him in flesh and bone, as
      any parent might; and the feeling that he could at best only see his child
      at the rarest and most cursory moments, if at all, drove him into a state
      of distraction which threatened to overthrow his promise to the boy's
      mother to keep out of his sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      But such was his chivalrous respect for Lady Icenway, and his regret at
      having ever deceived her, that he schooled his poor heart into submission.
      Owing to his loneliness, all the fervour of which he was capable-and that
      was much-flowed now in the channel of parental and marital love-for a
      child who did not know him, and a woman who had ceased to love him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length this singular punishment became such a torture to the poor
      foreigner that he resolved to lessen it at all hazards, compatible with
      punctilious care for the name of the lady his former wife, to whom his
      attachment seemed to increase in proportion to her punitive treatment of
      him. At one time of his life he had taken great interest in tulip-
      culture, as well as gardening in general; and since the ruin of his
      fortunes, and his arrival in England, he had made of his knowledge a
      precarious income in the hot-houses of nurserymen and others. With the new
      idea in his head he applied himself zealously to the business, till he
      acquired in a few months great skill in horticulture. Waiting till the
      noble lord, his lady's husband, had room for an under-gardener of a
      general sort, he offered himself for the place, and was engaged
      immediately by reason of his civility and intelligence, before Lady
      Icenway knew anything of the matter. Much therefore did he surprise her
      when she found him in the conservatories of her mansion a week or two
      after his arrival. The punishment of instant dismissal, with which at
      first she haughtily threatened him, my lady thought fit, on reflection,
      not to enforce. While he served her thus she knew he would not harm her by
      a word, while, if he were expelled, chagrin might induce him to reveal in
      a moment of exasperation what kind treatment would assist him to conceal.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he was allowed to remain on the premises, and had for his residence a
      little cottage by the garden-wall which had been the domicile of some of
      his predecessors in the same occupation. Here he lived absolutely alone,
      and spent much of his leisure in reading, but the greater part in watching
      the windows and lawns of his lady's house for glimpses of the form of the
      child. It was for that child's sake that he abandoned the tenets of the
      Roman Catholic Church in which he had been reared, and became the most
      regular attendant at the services in the parish place of worship hard by,
      where, sitting behind the pew of my lady, my lord, and his stepson, the
      gardener could pensively study the traits and movements of the youngster
      at only a few feet distance, without suspicion or hindrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      He filled his post for more than two years with a pleasure to himself
      which, though mournful, was soothing, his lady never forgiving him, or
      allowing him to be anything more than 'the gardener' to her child, though
      once or twice the boy said, 'That gardener's eyes are so sad! Why does he
      look so sadly at me?' He sunned himself in her scornfulness as if it were
      love, and his ears drank in her curt monosyllables as though they were
      rhapsodies of endearment. Strangely enough, the coldness with which she
      treated her foreigner began to be the conduct of Lord Icenway towards
      herself. It was a matter of great anxiety to him that there should be a
      lineal successor to the title, yet no sign of that successor appeared. One
      day he complained to her quite roughly of his fate. 'All will go to that
      dolt of a cousin!' he cried. 'I'd sooner see my name and place at the
      bottom of the sea!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady soothed him and fell into thought, and did not recriminate. But
      one day, soon after, she went down to the cottage of the gardener to
      inquire how he was getting on, for he had been ailing of late, though, as
      was supposed, not seriously. Though she often visited the poor, she had
      never entered her under-gardener's home before, and was much
      surprised-even grieved and dismayed-to find that he was too ill to rise
      from his bed. She went back to her mansion and returned with some delicate
      soup, that she might have a reason for seeing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      His condition was so feeble and alarming, and his face so thin, that it
      quite shocked her softening heart, and gazing upon him she said, 'You must
      get well-you must! I have been hard with you-I know it. I will not be so
      again.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The sick and dying man-for he was dying indeed-took her hand and pressed
      it to his lips. 'Too late, my darling, too late!' he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But you must not die! Oh, you must not!' she said. And on an impulse she
      bent down and whispered some words to him, blushing as she had blushed in
      her maiden days.
    </p>
    <p>
      He replied by a faint wan smile. 'Time was! . . . but that's past!' he
      said, 'I must die!'
    </p>
    <p>
      And die he did, a few days later, as the sun was going down behind the
      garden-wall. Her harshness seemed to come trebly home to her then, and she
      remorsefully exclaimed against herself in secret and alone. Her one desire
      now was to erect some tribute to his memory, without its being recognized
      as her handiwork. In the completion of this scheme there arrived a few
      months later a handsome stained-glass window for the church; and when it
      was unpacked and in course of erection Lord Icenway strolled into the
      building with his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Erected to his memory by his grieving widow,"' he said, reading the
      legend on the glass. 'I didn't know that he had a wife; I've never seen
      her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh yes, you must have, Icenway; only you forget,' replied his lady
      blandly. 'But she didn't live with him, and was seldom seen visiting him,
      because there were differences between them; which, as is usually the
      case, makes her all the more sorry now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And go ruining herself by this expensive ruby-and-azure glass-design.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She is not poor, they say.'
    </p>
    <p>
      As Lord Icenway grew older he became crustier and crustier, and whenever
      he set eyes on his wife's boy by her other husband he would burst out
      morosely, saying,
    </p>
    <p>
      ''Tis a very odd thing, my lady, that you could oblige your first husband,
      and couldn't oblige me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah! if I had only thought of it sooner!' she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What?' said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nothing, dearest,' replied Lady Icenway.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The Colonel was the first to comment upon the Churchwarden's tale, by
      saying that the fate of the poor fellow was rather a hard one.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman-tradesman could not see that his fate was at all too hard
      for him. He was legally nothing to her, and he had served her shamefully.
      If he had been really her husband it would have stood differently.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bookworm remarked that Lord Icenway seemed to have been a very
      unsuspicious man, with which view a fat member with a crimson face agreed.
      It was true his wife was a very close-mouthed personage, which made a
      difference. If she had spoken out recklessly her lord might have been
      suspicious enough, as in the case of that lady who lived at Stapleford
      Park in their great-grandfathers' time. Though there, to be sure,
      considerations arose which made her husband view matters with much
      philosophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few of the members doubted the possibility of this.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crimson man, who was a retired maltster of comfortable means, ventru,
      and short in stature, cleared his throat, blew off his superfluous breath,
      and proceeded to give the instance before alluded to of such possibility,
      first apologizing for his heroine's lack of a title, it never having been
      his good fortune to know many of the nobility. To his style of narrative
      the following is only an approximation.

    <h2>
      DAME THE SIXTH-SQUIRE PETRICK'S LADY
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By the Crimson Maltster
    </h3>
    <p>
      Folk who are at all acquainted with the traditions of Stapleford Park will
      not need to be told that in the middle of the last century it was owned by
      that trump of mortgagees, Timothy Petrick, whose skill in gaining
      possession of fair estates by granting sums of money on their title-deeds
      has seldom if ever been equalled in our part of England. Timothy was a
      lawyer by profession, and agent to several noblemen, by which means his
      special line of business became opened to him by a sort of revelation. It
      is said that a relative of his, a very deep thinker, who afterwards had
      the misfortune to be transported for life for mistaken notions on the
      signing of a will, taught him considerable legal lore, which he creditably
      resolved never to throw away for the benefit of other people, but to
      reserve it entirely for his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, I have nothing in particular to say about his early and active
      days, but rather of the time when, an old man, he had become the owner of
      vast estates by the means I have signified-among them the great manor of
      Stapleford, on which he lived, in the splendid old mansion now pulled
      down; likewise estates at Marlott, estates near Sherton Abbas, nearly all
      the borough of Millpool, and many properties near Ivell. Indeed, I can't
      call to mind half his landed possessions, and I don't know that it matters
      much at this time of day, seeing that he's been dead and gone many years.
      It is said that when he bought an estate he would not decide to pay the
      price till he had walked over every single acre with his own two feet, and
      prodded the soil at every point with his own spud, to test its quality,
      which, if we regard the extent of his properties, must have been a stiff
      business for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the time I am speaking of he was a man over eighty, and his son was
      dead; but he had two grandsons, the eldest of whom, his namesake, was
      married, and was shortly expecting issue. Just then the grandfather was
      taken ill, for death, as it seemed, considering his age. By his will the
      old man had created an entail (as I believe the lawyers call it), devising
      the whole of the estates to his elder grandson and his issue male, failing
      which, to his younger grandson and his issue male, failing which, to
      remoter relatives, who need not be mentioned now.
    </p>
    <p>
      While old Timothy Petrick was lying ill, his elder grandson's wife,
      Annetta, gave birth to her expected child, who, as fortune would have it,
      was a son. Timothy, her husband, through sprung of a scheming family, was
      no great schemer himself; he was the single one of the Petricks then
      living whose heart had ever been greatly moved by sentiments which did not
      run in the groove of ambition; and on this account he had not married
      well, as the saying is; his wife having been the daughter of a family of
      no better beginnings than his own; that is to say, her father was a
      country townsman of the professional class. But she was a very pretty
      woman, by all accounts, and her husband had seen, courted, and married her
      in a high tide of infatuation, after a very short acquaintance, and with
      very little knowledge of her heart's history. He had never found reason to
      regret his choice as yet, and his anxiety for her recovery was great.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was supposed to be out of danger, and herself and the child
      progressing well, when there was a change for the worse, and she sank so
      rapidly that she was soon given over. When she felt that she was about to
      leave him, Annetta sent for her husband, and, on his speedy entry and
      assurance that they were alone, she made him solemnly vow to give the
      child every care in any circumstances that might arise, if it should
      please Heaven to take her. This, of course, he readily promised. Then,
      after some hesitation, she told him that she could not die with a
      falsehood upon her soul, and dire deceit in her life; she must make a
      terrible confession to him before her lips were sealed for ever. She
      thereupon related an incident concerning the baby's parentage, which was
      not as he supposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Timothy Petrick, though a quick-feeling man, was not of a sort to show
      nerves outwardly; and he bore himself as heroically as he possibly could
      do in this trying moment of his life. That same night his wife died; and
      while she lay dead, and before her funeral, he hastened to the bedside of
      his sick grandfather, and revealed to him all that had happened: the
      baby's birth, his wife's confession, and her death, beseeching the aged
      man, as he loved him, to bestir himself now, at the eleventh hour, and
      alter his will so as to dish the intruder. Old Timothy, seeing matters in
      the same light as his grandson, required no urging against allowing
      anything to stand in the way of legitimate inheritance; he executed
      another will, limiting the entail to Timothy his grandson, for life, and
      his male heirs thereafter to be born; after them to his other grandson
      Edward, and Edward's heirs. Thus the newly- born infant, who had been the
      centre of so many hopes, was cut off and scorned as none of the elect.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old mortgagee lived but a short time after this, the excitement of the
      discovery having told upon him considerably, and he was gathered to his
      fathers like the most charitable man in his neighbourhood. Both wife and
      grandparent being buried, Timothy settled down to his usual life as well
      as he was able, mentally satisfied that he had by prompt action defeated
      the consequences of such dire domestic treachery as had been shown towards
      him, and resolving to marry a second time as soon as he could satisfy
      himself in the choice of a wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      But men do not always know themselves. The embittered state of Timothy
      Petrick's mind bred in him by degrees such a hatred and mistrust of
      womankind that, though several specimens of high attractiveness came under
      his eyes, he could not bring himself to the point of proposing marriage.
      He dreaded to take up the position of husband a second time, discerning a
      trap in every petticoat, and a Slough of Despond in possible heirs. 'What
      has happened once, when all seemed so fair, may happen again,' he said to
      himself. 'I'll risk my name no more.' So he abstained from marriage, and
      overcame his wish for a lineal descendant to follow him in the ownership
      of Stapleford.
    </p>
    <p>
      Timothy had scarcely noticed the unfortunate child that his wife had
      borne, after arranging for a meagre fulfilment of his promise to her to
      take care of the boy, by having him brought up in his house. Occasionally,
      remembering this promise, he went and glanced at the child, saw that he
      was doing well, gave a few special directions, and again went his solitary
      way. Thus he and the child lived on in the Stapleford mansion-house till
      two or three years had passed by. One day he was walking in the garden,
      and by some accident left his snuff-box on a bench. When he came back to
      find it he saw the little boy standing there; he had escaped his nurse,
      and was making a plaything of the box, in spite of the convulsive
      sneezings which the game brought in its train. Then the man with the
      encrusted heart became interested in the little fellow's persistence in
      his play under such discomforts; he looked in the child's face, saw there
      his wife's countenance, though he did not see his own, and fell into
      thought on the piteousness of childhood-particularly of despised and
      rejected childhood, like this before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      From that hour, try as he would to counteract the feeling, the human
      necessity to love something or other got the better of what he had called
      his wisdom, and shaped itself in a tender anxiety for the youngster
      Rupert. This name had been given him by his dying mother when, at her
      request, the child was baptized in her chamber, lest he should not survive
      for public baptism; and her husband had never thought of it as a name of
      any significance till, about this time, he learnt by accident that it was
      the name of the young Marquis of Christminster, son of the Duke of
      Southwesterland, for whom Annetta had cherished warm feelings before her
      marriage. Recollecting some wandering phrases in his wife's last words,
      which he had not understood at the time, he perceived at last that this
      was the person to whom she had alluded when affording him a clue to little
      Rupert's history.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would sit in silence for hours with the child, being no great speaker
      at the best of times; but the boy, on his part, was too ready with his
      tongue for any break in discourse to arise because Timothy Petrick had
      nothing to say. After idling away his mornings in this manner, Petrick
      would go to his own room and swear in long loud whispers, and walk up and
      down, calling himself the most ridiculous dolt that ever lived, and
      declaring that he would never go near the little fellow again; to which
      resolve he would adhere for the space perhaps of a day. Such cases are
      happily not new to human nature, but there never was a case in which a man
      more completely befocled his former self than in this.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the child grew up, Timothy's attachment to him grew deeper, till Rupert
      became almost the sole object for which he lived. There had been enough of
      the family ambition latent in him for Timothy Petrick to feel a little
      envy when, some time before this date, his brother Edward had been
      accepted by the Honourable Harriet Mountclere, daughter of the second
      Viscount of that name and title; but having discovered, as I have before
      stated, the paternity of his boy Rupert to lurk in even a higher stratum
      of society, those envious feelings speedily dispersed. Indeed, the more he
      reflected thereon, after his brother's aristocratic marriage, the more
      content did he become. His late wife took softer outline in his memory, as
      he thought of the lofty taste she had displayed, though only a plain
      burgher's daughter, and the justification for his weakness in loving the
      child-the justification that he had longed for-was afforded now in the
      knowledge that the boy was by nature, if not by name, a representative of
      one of the noblest houses in England.
    </p>
    <p>
      'She was a woman of grand instincts, after all,' he said to himself
      proudly. 'To fix her choice upon the immediate successor in that ducal
      line-it was finely conceived! Had he been of low blood like myself or my
      relations she would scarce have deserved the harsh measure that I have
      dealt out to her and her offspring. How much less, then, when such
      grovelling tastes were farthest from her soul! The man Annetta loved was
      noble, and my boy is noble in spite of me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The afterclap was inevitable, and it soon came. 'So far,' he reasoned,
      'from cutting off this child from inheritance of my estates, as I have
      done, I should have rejoiced in the possession of him! He is of pure stock
      on one side at least, whilst in the ordinary run of affairs he would have
      been a commoner to the bone.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Being a man, whatever his faults, of good old beliefs in the divinity of
      kings and those about 'em, the more he overhauled the case in this light,
      the more strongly did his poor wife's conduct in improving the blood and
      breed of the Petrick family win his heart. He considered what ugly, idle,
      hard-drinking scamps many of his own relations had been; the miserable
      scriveners, usurers, and pawnbrokers that he had numbered among his
      forefathers, and the probability that some of their bad qualities would
      have come out in a merely corporeal child, to give him sorrow in his old
      age, turn his black hairs gray, his gray hairs white, cut down every stick
      of timber, and Heaven knows what all, had he not, like a skilful gardener,
      minded his grafting and changed the sort; till at length this right-minded
      man fell down on his knees every night and morning and thanked God that he
      was not as other meanly descended fathers in such matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in the peculiar disposition of the Petrick family that the
      satisfaction which ultimately settled in Timothy's breast found
      nourishment. The Petricks had adored the nobility, and plucked them at the
      same time. That excellent man Izaak Walton's feelings about fish were much
      akin to those of old Timothy Petrick, and of his descendants in a lesser
      degree, concerning the landed aristocracy. To torture and to love
      simultaneously is a proceeding strange to reason, but possible to
      practice, as these instances show.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hence, when Timothy's brother Edward said slightingly one day that
      Timothy's son was well enough, but that he had nothing but shops and
      offices in his backward perspective, while his own children, should he
      have any, would be far different, in possessing such a mother as the
      Honourable Harriet, Timothy felt a bound of triumph within him at the
      power he possessed of contradicting that statement if he chose.
    </p>
    <p>
      So much was he interested in his boy in this new aspect that he now began
      to read up chronicles of the illustrious house ennobled as the Dukes of
      Southwesterland, from their very beginning in the glories of the
      Restoration of the blessed Charles till the year of his own time. He
      mentally noted their gifts from royalty, grants of lands, purchases,
      intermarriages, plantings and buildings; more particularly their political
      and military achievements, which had been great, and their performances in
      art and letters, which had been by no means contemptible. He studied
      prints of the portraits of that family, and then, like a chemist watching
      a crystallization, began to examine young Rupert's face for the unfolding
      of those historic curves and shades that the painters Vandyke and Lely had
      perpetuated on canvas.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the boy reached the most fascinating age of childhood, and his shouts
      of laughter ran through Stapleford House from end to end, the remorse that
      oppressed Timothy Petrick knew no bounds. Of all people in the world this
      Rupert was the one on whom he could have wished the estates to devolve;
      yet Rupert, by Timothy's own desperate strategy at the time of his birth,
      had been ousted from all inheritance of them; and, since he did not mean
      to remarry, the manors would pass to his brother and his brother's
      children, who would be nothing to him, whose boasted pedigree on one side
      would be nothing to his Rupert's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had he only left the first will of his grandfather alone!
    </p>
    <p>
      His mind ran on the wills continually, both of which were in existence,
      and the first, the cancelled one, in his own possession. Night after
      night, when the servants were all abed, and the click of safety locks
      sounded as loud as a crash, he looked at that first will, and wished it
      had been the second and not the first.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crisis came at last. One night, after having enjoyed the boy's company
      for hours, he could no longer bear that his beloved Rupert should be
      dispossessed, and he committed the felonious deed of altering the date of
      the earlier will to a fortnight later, which made its execution appear
      subsequent to the date of the second will already proved. He then boldly
      propounded the first will as the second.
    </p>
    <p>
      His brother Edward submitted to what appeared to be not only incontestible
      fact, but a far more likely disposition of old Timothy's property; for,
      like many others, he had been much surprised at the limitations defined in
      the other will, having no clue to their cause. He joined his brother
      Timothy in setting aside the hitherto accepted document, and matters went
      on in their usual course, there being no dispositions in the substituted
      will differing from those in the other, except such as related to a future
      which had not yet arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      The years moved on. Rupert had not yet revealed the anxiously expected
      historic lineaments which should foreshadow the political abilities of the
      ducal family aforesaid when it happened on a certain day that Timothy
      Petrick made the acquaintance of a well-known physician of Budmouth, who
      had been the medical adviser and friend of the late Mrs. Petrick's family
      for many years; though after Annetta's marriage, and consequent removal to
      Stapleford, he had seen no more of her, the neighbouring practitioner who
      attended the Petricks having then become her doctor as a matter of course.
      Timothy was impressed by the insight and knowledge disclosed in the
      conversation of the Budmouth physician, and the acquaintance ripening to
      intimacy, the physician alluded to a form of hallucination to which
      Annetta's mother and grandmother had been subject-that of believing in
      certain dreams as realities. He delicately inquired if Timothy had ever
      noticed anything of the sort in his wife during her lifetime; he, the
      physician, had fancied that he discerned germs of the same peculiarity in
      Annetta when he attended her in her girlhood. One explanation begat
      another, till the dumbfoundered Timothy Petrick was persuaded in his own
      mind that Annetta's confession to him had been based on a delusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You look down in the mouth?' said the doctor, pausing.
    </p>
    <p>
      'A bit unmanned. 'Tis unexpected-like,' sighed Timothy.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he could hardly believe it possible; and, thinking it best to be frank
      with the doctor, told him the whole story which, till now, he had never
      related to living man, save his dying grandfather. To his surprise, the
      physician informed him that such a form of delusion was precisely what he
      would have expected from Annetta's antecedents at such a physical crisis
      in her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Petrick prosecuted his inquiries elsewhere; and the upshot of his labours
      was, briefly, that a comparison of dates and places showed irrefutably
      that his poor wife's assertion could not possibly have foundation in fact.
      The young Marquis of her tender passion-a highly moral and bright-minded
      nobleman-had gone abroad the year before Annetta's marriage, and had not
      returned till after her death. The young girl's love for him had been a
      delicate ideal dream-no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Timothy went home, and the boy ran out to meet him; whereupon a strangely
      dismal feeling of discontent took possession of his soul. After all, then,
      there was nothing but plebeian blood in the veins of the heir to his name
      and estates; he was not to be succeeded by a noble- natured line. To be
      sure, Rupert was his son; but that glory and halo he believed him to have
      inherited from the ages, outshining that of his brother's children, had
      departed from Rupert's brow for ever; he could no longer read history in
      the boy's face, and centuries of domination in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      His manner towards his son grew colder and colder from that day forward;
      and it was with bitterness of heart that he discerned the characteristic
      features of the Petricks unfolding themselves by degrees. Instead of the
      elegant knife-edged nose, so typical of the Dukes of Southwesterland,
      there began to appear on his face the broad nostril and hollow bridge of
      his grandfather Timothy. No illustrious line of politicians was promised a
      continuator in that graying blue eye, for it was acquiring the expression
      of the orb of a particularly objectionable cousin of his own; and, instead
      of the mouth-curves which had thrilled Parliamentary audiences in speeches
      now bound in calf in every well- ordered library, there was the bull-lip
      of that very uncle of his who had had the misfortune with the signature of
      a gentleman's will, and had been transported for life in consequence.
    </p>
    <p>
      To think how he himself, too, had sinned in this same matter of a will for
      this mere fleshly reproduction of a wretched old uncle whose very name he
      wished to forget! The boy's Christian name, even, was an imposture and an
      irony, for it implied hereditary force and brilliancy to which he plainly
      would never attain. The consolation of real sonship was always left him
      certainly; but he could not help groaning to himself, 'Why cannot a son be
      one's own and somebody else's likewise!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The Marquis was shortly afterwards in the neighbourhood of Stapleford, and
      Timothy Petrick met him, and eyed his noble countenance admiringly. The
      next day, when Petrick was in his study, somebody knocked at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who's there?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Rupert.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll Rupert thee, you young impostor! Say, only a poor commonplace
      Petrick!' his father grunted. 'Why didn't you have a voice like the
      Marquis's I saw yesterday?' he continued, as the lad came in. 'Why haven't
      you his looks, and a way of commanding, as if you'd done it for
      centuries-hey?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why? How can you expect it, father, when I'm not related to him?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ugh! Then you ought to be!' growled his father.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      As the narrator paused, the surgeon, the Colonel, the historian, the
      Spark, and others exclaimed that such subtle and instructive psychological
      studies as this (now that psychology was so much in demand) were precisely
      the tales they desired, as members of a scientific club, and begged the
      master-maltster to tell another curious mental delusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The maltster shook his head, and feared he was not genteel enough to tell
      another story with a sufficiently moral tone in it to suit the club; he
      would prefer to leave the next to a better man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel had fallen into reflection. True it was, he observed, that the
      more dreamy and impulsive nature of woman engendered within her erratic
      fancies, which often started her on strange tracks, only to abandon them
      in sharp revulsion at the dictates of her common sense-sometimes with
      ludicrous effect. Events which had caused a lady's action to set in a
      particular direction might continue to enforce the same line of conduct,
      while she, like a mangle, would start on a sudden in a contrary course,
      and end where she began.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Vice-President laughed, and applauded the Colonel, adding that there
      surely lurked a story somewhere behind that sentiment, if he were not much
      mistaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel fixed his face to a good narrative pose, and went on without
      further preamble.

    <h2>
      DAME THE SEVENTH-ANNA, LADY BAXBY
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By the Colonel
    </h3>
    <p>
      It was in the time of the great Civil War-if I should not rather, as a
      loyal subject, call it, with Clarendon, the Great Rebellion. It was, I
      say, at that unhappy period of our history, that towards the autumn of a
      particular year, the Parliament forces sat down before Sherton Castle with
      over seven thousand foot and four pieces of cannon. The Castle, as we all
      know, was in that century owned and occupied by one of the Earls of
      Severn, and garrisoned for his assistance by a certain noble Marquis who
      commanded the King's troops in these parts. The said Earl, as well as the
      young Lord Baxby, his eldest son, were away from home just now, raising
      forces for the King elsewhere. But there were present in the Castle, when
      the besiegers arrived before it, the son's fair wife Lady Baxby, and her
      servants, together with some friends and near relatives of her husband;
      and the defence was so good and well-considered that they anticipated no
      great danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Parliamentary forces were also commanded by a noble lord-for the
      nobility were by no means, at this stage of the war, all on the King's
      side-and it had been observed during his approach in the night-time, and
      in the morning when the reconnoitring took place, that he appeared sad and
      much depressed. The truth was that, by a strange freak of destiny, it had
      come to pass that the stronghold he was set to reduce was the home of his
      own sister, whom he had tenderly loved during her maidenhood, and whom he
      loved now, in spite of the estrangement which had resulted from
      hostilities with her husband's family. He believed, too, that,
      notwithstanding this cruel division, she still was sincerely attached to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      His hesitation to point his ordnance at the walls was inexplicable to
      those who were strangers to his family history. He remained in the field
      on the north side of the Castle (called by his name to this day because of
      his encampment there) till it occurred to him to send a messenger to his
      sister Anna with a letter, in which he earnestly requested her, as she
      valued her life, to steal out of the place by the little gate to the
      south, and make away in that direction to the residence of some friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly after he saw, to his great surprise, coming from the front of the
      Castle walls a lady on horseback, with a single attendant. She rode
      straight forward into the field, and up the slope to where his army and
      tents were spread. It was not till she got quite near that he discerned
      her to be his sister Anna; and much was he alarmed that she should have
      run such risk as to sally out in the face of his forces without knowledge
      of their proceedings, when at any moment their first discharge might have
      burst forth, to her own destruction in such exposure. She dismounted
      before she was quite close to him, and he saw that her familiar face,
      though pale, was not at all tearful, as it would have been in their
      younger days. Indeed, if the particulars as handed down are to be
      believed, he was in a more tearful state than she, in his anxiety about
      her. He called her into his tent, out of the gaze of those around; for
      though many of the soldiers were honest and serious- minded men, he could
      not bear that she who had been his dear companion in childhood should be
      exposed to curious observation in this her great grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they were alone in the tent he clasped her in his arms, for he had
      not seen her since those happier days when, at the commencement of the
      war, her husband and himself had been of the same mind about the arbitrary
      conduct of the King, and had little dreamt that they would not go to
      extremes together. She was the calmest of the two, it is said, and was the
      first to speak connectedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'William, I have come to you,' said she, 'but not to save myself as you
      suppose. Why, oh, why do you persist in supporting this disloyal cause,
      and grieving us so?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Say not that,' he replied hastily. 'If truth hides at the bottom of a
      well, why should you suppose justice to be in high places? I am for the
      right at any price. Anna, leave the Castle; you are my sister; come away,
      my dear, and save thy life!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never!' says she. 'Do you plan to carry out this attack, and level the
      Castle indeed?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Most certainly I do,' says he. 'What meaneth this army around us if not
      so?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then you will find the bones of your sister buried in the ruins you
      cause!' said she. And without another word she turned and left him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Anna-abide with me!' he entreated. 'Blood is thicker than water, and what
      is there in common between you and your husband now?'
    </p>
    <p>
      But she shook her head and would not hear him and hastening out, mounted
      her horse, and returned towards the Castle as she had come. Ay, many's the
      time when I have been riding to hounds across that field that I have
      thought of that scene!
    </p>
    <p>
      When she had quite gone down the field, and over the intervening ground,
      and round the bastion, so that he could no longer even see the tip of her
      mare's white tail, he was much more deeply moved by emotions concerning
      her and her welfare than he had been while she was before him. He wildly
      reproached himself that he had not detained her by force for her own good,
      so that, come what might, she would be under his protection and not under
      that of her husband, whose impulsive nature rendered him too open to
      instantaneous impressions and sudden changes of plan; he was now acting in
      this cause and now in that, and lacked the cool judgment necessary for the
      protection of a woman in these troubled times. Her brother thought of her
      words again and again, and sighed, and even considered if a sister were
      not of more value than a principle, and if he would not have acted more
      naturally in throwing in his lot with hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The delay of the besiegers in attacking the Castle was said to be entirely
      owing to this distraction on the part of their leader, who remained on the
      spot attempting some indecisive operations, and parleying with the
      Marquis, then in command, with far inferior forces, within the Castle. It
      never occurred to him that in the meantime the young Lady Baxby, his
      sister, was in much the same mood as himself. Her brother's familiar voice
      and eyes, much worn and fatigued by keeping the field, and by family
      distractions on account of this unhappy feud, rose upon her vision all the
      afternoon, and as day waned she grew more and more Parliamentarian in her
      principles, though the only arguments which had addressed themselves to
      her were those of family ties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband, General Lord Baxby, had been expected to return all the day
      from his excursion into the east of the county, a message having been sent
      to him informing him of what had happened at home; and in the evening he
      arrived with reinforcements in unexpected numbers. Her brother retreated
      before these to a hill near Ivell, four or five miles off, to afford the
      men and himself some repose. Lord Baxby duly placed his forces, and there
      was no longer any immediate danger. By this time Lady Baxby's feelings
      were more Parliamentarian than ever, and in her fancy the fagged
      countenance of her brother, beaten back by her husband, seemed to reproach
      her for heartlessness. When her husband entered her apartment, ruddy and
      boisterous, and full of hope, she received him but sadly; and upon his
      casually uttering some slighting words about her brother's withdrawal,
      which seemed to convey an imputation upon his courage, she resented them,
      and retorted that he, Lord Baxby himself, had been against the Court-party
      at first, where it would be much more to his credit if he were at present,
      and showing her brother's consistency of opinion, instead of supporting
      the lying policy of the King (as she called it) for the sake of a barren
      principle of loyalty, which was but an empty expression when a King was
      not at one with his people. The dissension grew bitter between them,
      reaching to little less than a hot quarrel, both being quick-tempered
      souls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Baxby was weary with his long day's march and other excitements, and
      soon retired to bed. His lady followed some time after. Her husband slept
      profoundly, but not so she; she sat brooding by the window-slit, and
      lifting the curtain looked forth upon the hills without.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the silence between the footfalls of the sentinels she could hear faint
      sounds of her brother's camp on the distant hills, where the soldiery had
      hardly settled as yet into their bivouac since their evening's retreat.
      The first frosts of autumn had touched the grass, and shrivelled the more
      delicate leaves of the creepers; and she thought of William sleeping on
      the chilly ground, under the strain of these hardships. Tears flooded her
      eyes as she returned to her husband's imputations upon his courage, as if
      there could be any doubt of Lord William's courage after what he had done
      in the past days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Baxby's long and reposeful breathings in his comfortable bed vexed
      her now, and she came to a determination on an impulse. Hastily lighting a
      taper, she wrote on a scrap of paper:
    </p>
    <p>
      'Blood is thicker than water, dear William-I will come;' and with this in
      her hand, she went to the door of the room, and out upon the stairs; on
      second thoughts turning back for a moment, to put on her husband's hat and
      cloak-not the one he was daily wearing-that if seen in the twilight she
      might at a casual glance appear as some lad or hanger-on of one of the
      household women; thus accoutred she descended a flight of circular stairs,
      at the bottom of which was a door opening upon the terrace towards the
      west, in the direction of her brother's position. Her object was to slip
      out without the sentry seeing her, get to the stables, arouse one of the
      varlets, and send him ahead of her along the highway with the note to warn
      her brother of her approach, to throw in her lot with his.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was still in the shadow of the wall on the west terrace, waiting for
      the sentinel to be quite out of the way, when her ears were greeted by a
      voice, saying, from the adjoining shade-
    </p>
    <p>
      'Here I be!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The tones were the tones of a woman. Lady Baxby made no reply, and stood
      close to the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My Lord Baxby,' the voice continued; and she could recognize in it the
      local accent of some girl from the little town of Sherton, close at hand.
      'I be tired of waiting, my dear Lord Baxby! I was afeard you would never
      come!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Baxby flushed hot to her toes.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How the wench loves him!' she said to herself, reasoning from the tones
      of the voice, which were plaintive and sweet and tender as a bird's. She
      changed from the home-hating truant to the strategic wife in one moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hist!' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My lord, you told me ten o'clock, and 'tis near twelve now,' continues
      the other. 'How could ye keep me waiting so if you love me as you said? I
      should have stuck to my lover in the Parliament troops if it had not been
      for thee, my dear lord!'
    </p>
    <p>
      There was not the least doubt that Lady Baxby had been mistaken for her
      husband by this intriguing damsel. Here was a pretty underhand business!
      Here were sly manoeuvrings! Here was faithlessness! Here was a precious
      assignation surprised in the midst! Her wicked husband, whom till this
      very moment she had ever deemed the soul of good faith-how could he!
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Baxby precipitately retreated to the door in the turret, closed it,
      locked it, and ascended one round of the staircase, where there was a
      loophole. 'I am not coming! I, Lord Baxby, despise ye and all your wanton
      tribe!' she hissed through the opening; and then crept upstairs, as firmly
      rooted in Royalist principles as any man in the Castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband still slept the sleep of the weary, well-fed, and well-
      drunken, if not of the just; and Lady Baxby quickly disrobed herself
      without assistance-being, indeed, supposed by her woman to have retired to
      rest long ago. Before lying down, she noiselessly locked the door and
      placed the key under her pillow. More than that, she got a staylace, and,
      creeping up to her lord, in great stealth tied the lace in a tight knot to
      one of his long locks of hair, attaching the other end of the lace to the
      bedpost; for, being tired herself now, she feared she might sleep heavily;
      and, if her husband should wake, this would be a delicate hint that she
      had discovered all.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is added that, to make assurance trebly sure, her gentle ladyship, when
      she had lain down to rest, held her lord's hand in her own during the
      whole of the night. But this is old-wives' gossip, and not corroborated.
      What Lord Baxby thought and said when he awoke the next morning, and found
      himself so strangely tethered, is likewise only matter of conjecture;
      though there is no reason to suppose that his rage was great. The extent
      of his culpability as regards the intrigue was this much; that, while
      halting at a cross-road near Sherton that day, he had flirted with a
      pretty young woman, who seemed nothing loth, and had invited her to the
      Castle terrace after dark-an invitation which he quite forgot on his
      arrival home.
    </p>
    <p>
      The subsequent relations of Lord and Lady Baxby were not again greatly
      embittered by quarrels, so far as is known; though the husband's conduct
      in later life was occasionally eccentric, and the vicissitudes of his
      public career culminated in long exile. The siege of the Castle was not
      regularly undertaken till two or three years later than the time I have
      been describing, when Lady Baxby and all the women therein, except the
      wife of the then Governor, had been removed to safe distance. That
      memorable siege of fifteen days by Fairfax, and the surrender of the old
      place on an August evening, is matter of history, and need not be told by
      me.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The Man of Family spoke approvingly across to the Colonel when the Club
      had done smiling, declaring that the story was an absolutely faithful page
      of history, as he had good reason to know, his own people having been
      engaged in that well-known scrimmage. He asked if the Colonel had ever
      heard the equally well-authenticated, though less martial tale of a
      certain Lady Penelope, who lived in the same century, and not a score of
      miles from the same place?
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel had not heard it, nor had anybody except the local historian;
      and the inquirer was induced to proceed forthwith.

    <h2>
      DAME THE EIGHTH-THE LADY PENELOPE
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By the Man of Family
    </h3>
    <p>
      In going out of Casterbridge by the low-lying road which eventually
      conducts to the town of Ivell, you see on the right hand an ivied manor-
      house, flanked by battlemented towers, and more than usually distinguished
      by the size of its many mullioned windows. Though still of good capacity,
      the building is much reduced from its original grand proportions; it has,
      moreover, been shorn of the fair estate which once appertained to its
      lord, with the exception of a few acres of park-land immediately around
      the mansion. This was formerly the seat of the ancient and knightly family
      of the Drenghards, or Drenkhards, now extinct in the male line, whose
      name, according to the local chronicles, was interpreted to mean Strenuus
      Miles, vel Potator, though certain members of the family were averse to
      the latter signification, and a duel was fought by one of them on that
      account, as is well known. With this, however, we are not now concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the early part of the reign of the first King James, there was visiting
      near this place of the Drenghards a lady of noble family and extraordinary
      beauty. She was of the purest descent; ah, there's seldom such blood
      nowadays as hers! She possessed no great wealth, it was said, but was
      sufficiently endowed. Her beauty was so perfect, and her manner so
      entrancing, that suitors seemed to spring out of the ground wherever she
      went, a sufficient cause of anxiety to the Countess her mother, her only
      living parent. Of these there were three in particular, whom neither her
      mother's complaints of prematurity, nor the ready raillery of the maiden
      herself, could effectually put off. The said gallants were a certain Sir
      John Gale, a Sir William Hervy, and the well-known Sir George Drenghard,
      one of the Drenghard family before- mentioned. They had, curiously enough,
      all been equally honoured with the distinction of knighthood, and their
      schemes for seeing her were manifold, each fearing that one of the others
      would steal a march over himself. Not content with calling, on every
      imaginable excuse, at the house of the relative with whom she sojourned,
      they intercepted her in rides and in walks; and if any one of them chanced
      to surprise another in the act of paying her marked attentions, the
      encounter often ended in an altercation of great violence. So heated and
      impassioned, indeed, would they become, that the lady hardly felt herself
      safe in their company at such times, notwithstanding that she was a brave
      and buxom damsel, not easily put out, and with a daring spirit of humour
      in her composition, if not of coquetry.
    </p>
    <p>
      At one of these altercations, which had place in her relative's grounds,
      and was unusually bitter, threatening to result in a duel, she found it
      necessary to assert herself. Turning haughtily upon the pair of
      disputants, she declared that whichever should be the first to break the
      peace between them, no matter what the provocation, that man should never
      be admitted to her presence again; and thus would she effectually stultify
      the aggressor by making the promotion of a quarrel a distinct bar to its
      object.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the two knights were wearing rather a crest-fallen appearance at her
      reprimand, the third, never far off, came upon the scene, and she repeated
      her caveat to him also. Seeing, then, how great was the concern of all at
      her peremptory mood, the lady's manner softened, and she said with a
      roguish smile-
    </p>
    <p>
      'Have patience, have patience, you foolish men! Only bide your time
      quietly, and, in faith, I will marry you all in turn!'
    </p>
    <p>
      They laughed heartily at this sally, all three together, as though they
      were the best of friends; at which she blushed, and showed some
      embarrassment, not having realized that her arch jest would have sounded
      so strange when uttered. The meeting which resulted thus, however, had its
      good effect in checking the bitterness of their rivalry; and they repeated
      her speech to their relatives and acquaintance with a hilarious frequency
      and publicity that the lady little divined, or she might have blushed and
      felt more embarrassment still.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of time the position resolved itself, and the beauteous Lady
      Penelope (as she was called) made up her mind; her choice being the eldest
      of the three knights, Sir George Drenghard, owner of the mansion
      aforesaid, which thereupon became her home; and her husband being a
      pleasant man, and his family, though not so noble, of as good repute as
      her own, all things seemed to show that she had reckoned wisely in
      honouring him with her preference.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what may lie behind the still and silent veil of the future none can
      foretell. In the course of a few months the husband of her choice died of
      his convivialities (as if, indeed, to bear out his name), and the Lady
      Penelope was left alone as mistress of his house. By this time she had
      apparently quite forgotten her careless declaration to her lovers
      collectively; but the lovers themselves had not forgotten it; and, as she
      would now be free to take a second one of them, Sir John Gale appeared at
      her door as early in her widowhood as it was proper and seemly to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave him little encouragement; for, of the two remaining, her best
      beloved was Sir William, of whom, if the truth must be told, she had often
      thought during her short married life. But he had not yet reappeared. Her
      heart began to be so much with him now that she contrived to convey to
      him, by indirect hints through his friends, that she would not be
      displeased by a renewal of his former attentions. Sir William, however,
      misapprehended her gentle signalling, and from excellent, though mistaken
      motives of delicacy, delayed to intrude himself upon her for a long time.
      Meanwhile Sir John, now created a baronet, was unremitting, and she began
      to grow somewhat piqued at the backwardness of him she secretly desired to
      be forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never mind,' her friends said jestingly to her (knowing of her humorous
      remark, as everybody did, that she would marry them all three if they
      would have patience)-'never mind; why hesitate upon the order of them?
      Take 'em as they come.'
    </p>
    <p>
      This vexed her still more, and regretting deeply, as she had often done,
      that such a careless speech should ever have passed her lips, she fairly
      broke down under Sir John's importunity, and accepted his hand. They were
      married on a fine spring morning, about the very time at which the
      unfortunate Sir William discovered her preference for him, and was
      beginning to hasten home from a foreign court to declare his unaltered
      devotion to her. On his arrival in England he learnt the sad truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Sir William suffered at her precipitancy under what she had deemed his
      neglect, the Lady Penelope herself suffered more. She had not long been
      the wife of Sir John Gale before he showed a disposition to retaliate upon
      her for the trouble and delay she had put him to in winning her. With
      increasing frequency he would tell her that, as far as he could perceive,
      she was an article not worth such labour as he had bestowed in obtaining
      it, and such snubbings as he had taken from his rivals on the same
      account. These and other cruel things he repeated till he made the lady
      weep sorely, and wellnigh broke her spirit, though she had formerly been
      such a mettlesome dame. By degrees it became perceptible to all her
      friends that her life was a very unhappy one; and the fate of the fair
      woman seemed yet the harder in that it was her own stately mansion, left
      to her sole use by her first husband, which her second had entered into
      and was enjoying, his being but a mean and meagre erection.
    </p>
    <p>
      But such is the flippancy of friends that when she met them, and secretly
      confided her grief to their ears, they would say cheerily, 'Lord, never
      mind, my dear; there's a third to come yet!'-at which maladroit remark she
      would show much indignation, and tell them they should know better than to
      trifle on so solemn a theme. Yet that the poor lady would have been only
      too happy to be the wife of the third, instead of Sir John whom she had
      taken, was painfully obvious, and much she was blamed for her foolish
      choice by some people. Sir William, however, had returned to foreign
      cities on learning the news of her marriage, and had never been heard of
      since.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two or three years of suffering were passed by Lady Penelope as the
      despised and chidden wife of this man Sir John, amid regrets that she had
      so greatly mistaken him, and sighs for one whom she thought never to see
      again, till it chanced that her husband fell sick of some slight ailment.
      One day after this, when she was sitting in his room, looking from the
      window upon the expanse in front, she beheld, approaching the house on
      foot, a form she seemed to know well. Lady Penelope withdrew silently from
      the sickroom, and descended to the hall, whence, through the doorway, she
      saw entering between the two round towers, which at that time flanked the
      gateway, Sir William Hervy, as she had surmised, but looking thin and
      travel-worn. She advanced into the courtyard to meet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I was passing through Casterbridge,' he said, with faltering deference,
      'and I walked out to ask after your ladyship's health. I felt that I could
      do no less; and, of course, to pay my respects to your good husband, my
      heretofore acquaintance . . . But oh, Penelope, th'st look sick and
      sorry!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am heartsick, that's all,' said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      They could see in each other an emotion which neither wished to express,
      and they stood thus a long time with tears in their eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He does not treat 'ee well, I hear,' said Sir William in a low voice.
      'May God in Heaven forgive him; but it is asking a great deal!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hush, hush!' said she hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nay, but I will speak what I may honestly say,' he answered. 'I am not
      under your roof, and my tongue is free. Why didst not wait for me,
      Penelope, or send to me a more overt letter? I would have travelled night
      and day to come!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Too late, William; you must not ask it,' said she, endeavouring to quiet
      him as in old times. 'My husband just now is unwell. He will grow better
      in a day or two, maybe. You must call again and see him before you leave
      Casterbridge.'
    </p>
    <p>
      As she said this their eyes met. Each was thinking of her lightsome words
      about taking the three men in turn; each thought that two-thirds of that
      promise had been fulfilled. But, as if it were unpleasant to her that this
      recollection should have arisen, she spoke again quickly: 'Come again in a
      day or two, when my husband will be well enough to see you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir William departed without entering the house, and she returned to Sir
      John's chamber. He, rising from his pillow, said, 'To whom hast been
      talking, wife, in the courtyard? I heard voices there.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated, and he repeated the question more impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I do not wish to tell you now,' said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But I wooll know!' said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she answered, 'Sir William Hervy.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'By G&mdash;- I thought as much!' cried Sir John, drops of perspiration
      standing on his white face. 'A skulking villain! A sick man's ears are
      keen, my lady. I heard that they were lover-like tones, and he called 'ee
      by your Christian name. These be your intrigues, my lady, when I am off my
      legs awhile!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'On my honour,' cried she, 'you do me a wrong. I swear I did not know of
      his coming!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Swear as you will,' said Sir John, 'I don't believe 'ee.' And with this
      he taunted her, and worked himself into a greater passion, which much
      increased his illness. His lady sat still, brooding. There was that upon
      her face which had seldom been there since her marriage; and she seemed to
      think anew of what she had so lightly said in the days of her freedom,
      when her three lovers were one and all coveting her hand. 'I began at the
      wrong end of them,' she murmured. 'My God-that did I!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What?' said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      'A trifle,' said she. 'I spoke to myself only.'
    </p>
    <p>
      It was somewhat strange that after this day, while she went about the
      house with even a sadder face than usual, her churlish husband grew worse;
      and what was more, to the surprise of all, though to the regret of few, he
      died a fortnight later. Sir William had not called upon him as he had
      promised, having received a private communication from Lady Penelope,
      frankly informing him that to do so would be inadvisable, by reason of her
      husband's temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now when Sir John was gone, and his remains carried to his family
      burying-place in another part of England, the lady began in due time to
      wonder whither Sir William had betaken himself. But she had been cured of
      precipitancy (if ever woman were), and was prepared to wait her whole
      lifetime a widow if the said Sir William should not reappear. Her life was
      now passed mostly within the walls, or in promenading between the
      pleasaunce and the bowling-green; and she very seldom went even so far as
      the high road which then skirted the grounds on the north, though it has
      now, and for many years, been diverted to the south side. Her patience was
      rewarded (if love be in any case a reward); for one day, many months after
      her second husband's death, a messenger arrived at her gate with the
      intelligence that Sir William Hervy was again in Casterbridge, and would
      be glad to know if it were her pleasure that he should wait upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It need hardly be said that permission was joyfully granted, and within
      two hours her lover stood before her, a more thoughtful man than formerly,
      but in all essential respects the same man, generous, modest to
      diffidence, and sincere. The reserve which womanly decorum threw over her
      manner was but too obviously artificial, and when he said 'the ways of
      Providence are strange,' and added after a moment, 'and merciful
      likewise,' she could not conceal her agitation, and burst into tears upon
      his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But this is too soon,' she said, starting back.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But no,' said he. 'You are eleven months gone in widowhood, and it is not
      as if Sir John had been a good husband to you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      His visits grew pretty frequent now, as may well be guessed, and in a
      month or two he began to urge her to an early union. But she counselled a
      little longer delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why?' said he. 'Surely I have waited long! Life is short; we are getting
      older every day, and I am the last of the three.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' said the lady frankly. 'And that is why I would not have you
      hasten. Our marriage may seem so strange to everybody, after my unlucky
      remark on that occasion we know so well, and which so many others know
      likewise, thanks to talebearers.'
    </p>
    <p>
      On this representation he conceded a little space, for the sake of her
      good name. But the destined day of their marriage at last arrived, and it
      was a gay time for the villagers and all concerned, and the bells in the
      parish church rang from noon till night. Thus at last she was united to
      the man who had loved her the most tenderly of them all, who but for his
      reticence might perhaps have been the first to win her. Often did he say
      to himself; 'How wondrous that her words should have been fulfilled! Many
      a truth hath been spoken in jest, but never a more remarkable one!' The
      noble lady herself preferred not to dwell on the coincidence, a certain
      shyness, if not shame, crossing her fair face at any allusion thereto.
    </p>
    <p>
      But people will have their say, sensitive souls or none, and their sayings
      on this third occasion took a singular shape. 'Surely,' they whispered,
      'there is something more than chance in this . . . The death of the first
      was possibly natural; but what of the death of the second, who ill-used
      her, and whom, loving the third so desperately, she must have wished out
      of the way?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they pieced together sundry trivial incidents of Sir John's illness,
      and dwelt upon the indubitable truth that he had grown worse after her
      lover's unexpected visit; till a very sinister theory was built up as to
      the hand she may have had in Sir John's premature demise. But nothing of
      this suspicion was said openly, for she was a lady of noble birth-nobler,
      indeed, than either of her husbands-and what people suspected they feared
      to express in formal accusation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mansion that she occupied had been left to her for so long a time as
      she should choose to reside in it, and, having a regard for the spot, she
      had coaxed Sir William to remain there. But in the end it was unfortunate;
      for one day, when in the full tide of his happiness, he was walking among
      the willows near the gardens, where he overheard a conversation between
      some basket-makers who were cutting the osiers for their use. In this
      fatal dialogue the suspicions of the neighbouring townsfolk were revealed
      to him for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      'A cupboard close to his bed, and the key in her pocket. Ah!' said one.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And a blue phial therein-h'm!' said another.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And spurge-laurel leaves among the hearth-ashes. Oh-oh!' said a third.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his return home Sir William seemed to have aged years. But he said
      nothing; indeed, it was a thing impossible. And from that hour a ghastly
      estrangement began. She could not understand it, and simply waited. One
      day he said, however, 'I must go abroad.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why?' said she. 'William, have I offended you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No,' said he; 'but I must go.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She could coax little more out of him, and in itself there was nothing
      unnatural in his departure, for he had been a wanderer from his youth. In
      a few days he started off, apparently quite another man than he who had
      rushed to her side so devotedly a few months before.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not known when, or how, the rumours, which were so thick in the
      atmosphere around her, actually reached the Lady Penelope's ears, but that
      they did reach her there is no doubt. It was impossible that they should
      not; the district teemed with them; they rustled in the air like
      night-birds of evil omen. Then a reason for her husband's departure
      occurred to her appalled mind, and a loss of health became quickly
      apparent. She dwindled thin in the face, and the veins in her temples
      could all be distinctly traced. An inner fire seemed to be withering her
      away. Her rings fell off her fingers, and her arms hung like the flails of
      the threshers, though they had till lately been so round and so elastic.
      She wrote to her husband repeatedly, begging him to return to her; but he,
      being in extreme and wretched doubt, moreover, knowing nothing of her
      ill-health, and never suspecting that the rumours had reached her also,
      deemed absence best, and postponed his return awhile, giving various good
      reasons for his delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, however, when the Lady Penelope had given birth to a still-
      born child, her mother, the Countess, addressed a letter to Sir William,
      requesting him to come back to her if he wished to see her alive; since
      she was wasting away of some mysterious disease, which seemed to be rather
      mental than physical. It was evident that his mother-in-law knew nothing
      of the secret, for she lived at a distance; but Sir William promptly
      hastened home, and stood beside the bed of his now dying wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Believe me, William,' she said when they were alone, 'I am
      innocent-innocent!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of what?' said he. 'Heaven forbid that I should accuse you of anything!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But you do accuse me-silently!' she gasped. 'I could not write
      thereon-and ask you to hear me. It was too much, too degrading. But would
      that I had been less proud! They suspect me of poisoning him, William!
      But, oh my dear husband, I am innocent of that wicked crime! He died
      naturally. I loved you-too soon; but that was all!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing availed to save her. The worm had gnawed too far into her heart
      before Sir William's return for anything to be remedial now; and in a few
      weeks she breathed her last. After her death the people spoke louder, and
      her conduct became a subject of public discussion. A little later on, the
      physician, who had attended the late Sir John, heard the rumour, and came
      down from the place near London to which he latterly had retired, with the
      express purpose of calling upon Sir William Hervy, now staying in
      Casterbridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stated that, at the request of a relative of Sir John's, who wished to
      be assured on the matter by reason of its suddenness, he had, with the
      assistance of a surgeon, made a private examination of Sir John's body
      immediately after his decease, and found that it had resulted from purely
      natural causes. Nobody at this time had breathed a suspicion of foul play,
      and therefore nothing was said which might afterwards have established her
      innocence.
    </p>
    <p>
      It being thus placed beyond doubt that this beautiful and noble lady had
      been done to death by a vile scandal that was wholly unfounded, her
      husband was stung with a dreadful remorse at the share he had taken in her
      misfortunes, and left the country anew, this time never to return alive.
      He survived her but a few years, and his body was brought home and buried
      beside his wife's under the tomb which is still visible in the parish
      church. Until lately there was a good portrait of her, in weeds for her
      first husband, with a cross in her hand, at the ancestral seat of her
      family, where she was much pitied, as she deserved to be. Yet there were
      some severe enough to say-and these not unjust persons in other
      respects-that though unquestionably innocent of the crime imputed to her,
      she had shown an unseemly wantonness in contracting three marriages in
      such rapid succession; that the untrue suspicion might have been ordered
      by Providence (who often works indirectly) as a punishment for her
      self-indulgence. Upon that point I have no opinion to offer.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The reverend the Vice-President, however, the tale being ended, offered as
      his opinion that her fate ought to be quite clearly recognized as a
      punishment. So thought the Churchwarden, and also the quiet gentleman
      sitting near. The latter knew many other instances in point, one of which
      could be narrated in a few words.

    <h2>
      DAME THE NINTH-THE DUCHESS OF HAMPTONSHIRE
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By the Quiet Gentleman
    </h3>
    <p>
      Some fifty years ago, the then Duke of Hamptonshire, fifth of that title,
      was incontestibly the head man in his county, and particularly in the
      neighbourhood of Batton. He came of the ancient and loyal family of
      Saxelbye, which, before its ennoblement, had numbered many knightly and
      ecclesiastical celebrities in its male line. It would have occupied a
      painstaking county historian a whole afternoon to take rubbings of the
      numerous effigies and heraldic devices graven to their memory on the
      brasses, tablets, and altar-tombs in the aisle of the parish-church. The
      Duke himself, however, was a man little attracted by ancient chronicles in
      stone and metal, even when they concerned his own beginnings. He allowed
      his mind to linger by preference on the many graceless and unedifying
      pleasures which his position placed at his command. He could on occasion
      close the mouths of his dependents by a good bomb-like oath, and he argued
      doggedly with the parson on the virtues of cock-fighting and baiting the
      bull.
    </p>
    <p>
      This nobleman's personal appearance was somewhat impressive. His
      complexion was that of the copper-beech tree. His frame was stalwart,
      though slightly stooping. His mouth was large, and he carried an
      unpolished sapling as his walking-stick, except when he carried a spud for
      cutting up any thistle he encountered on his walks. His castle stood in
      the midst of a park, surrounded by dusky elms, except to the southward;
      and when the moon shone out, the gleaming stone facade, backed by heavy
      boughs, was visible from the distant high road as a white spot on the
      surface of darkness. Though called a castle, the building was little
      fortified, and had been erected with greater eye to internal convenience
      than those crannied places of defence to which the name strictly
      appertains. It was a castellated mansion as regular as a chessboard on its
      ground-plan, ornamented with make-believe bastions and machicolations,
      behind which were stacks of battlemented chimneys. On still mornings, at
      the fire-lighting hour, when ghostly house-maids stalk the corridors, and
      thin streaks of light through the shutter- chinks lend startling winks and
      smiles to ancestors on canvas, twelve or fifteen thin stems of blue smoke
      sprouted upwards from these chimney- tops, and spread into a flat canopy
      on high. Around the site stretched ten thousand acres of good, fat,
      unimpeachable soil, plentiful in glades and lawns wherever visible from
      the castle-windows, and merging in homely arable where screened from the
      too curious eye by ingeniously- contrived plantations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some way behind the owner of all this came the second man in the parish,
      the rector, the Honourable and Reverend Mr. Oldbourne, a widower, over
      stiff and stern for a clergyman, whose severe white neckcloth, well-kept
      gray hair, and right-lined face betokened none of those sympathetic traits
      whereon depends so much of a parson's power to do good among his
      fellow-creatures. The last, far-removed man of the series-altogether the
      Neptune of these local primaries-was the curate, Mr. Alwyn Hill. He was a
      handsome young deacon with curly hair, dreamy eyes-so dreamy that to look
      long into them was like ascending and floating among summer clouds-a
      complexion as fresh as a flower, and a chin absolutely beardless. Though
      his age was about twenty-five, he looked not much over nineteen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rector had a daughter called Emmeline, of so sweet and simple a nature
      that her beauty was discovered, measured, and inventoried by almost
      everybody in that part of the country before it was suspected by herself
      to exist. She had been bred in comparative solitude; a rencounter with men
      troubled and confused her. Whenever a strange visitor came to her father's
      house she slipped into the orchard and remained till he was gone,
      ridiculing her weakness in apostrophes, but unable to overcome it. Her
      virtues lay in no resistant force of character, but in a natural
      inappetency for evil things, which to her were as unmeaning as joints of
      flesh to a herbivorous creature. Her charms of person, manner, and mind,
      had been clear for some time to the Antinous in orders, and no less so to
      the Duke, who, though scandalously ignorant of dainty phrases, ever
      showing a clumsy manner towards the gentler sex, and, in short, not at all
      a lady's man, took fire to a degree that was wellnigh terrible at sudden
      sight of Emmeline, a short time after she was turned seventeen.
    </p>
    <p>
      It occurred one afternoon at the corner of a shrubbery between the castle
      and the rectory, where the Duke was standing to watch the heaving of a
      mole, when the fair girl brushed past at a distance of a few yards, in the
      full light of the sun, and without hat or bonnet. The Duke went home like
      a man who had seen a spirit. He ascended to the picture- gallery of his
      castle, and there passed some time in staring at the bygone beauties of
      his line as if he had never before considered what an important part those
      specimens of womankind had played in the evolution of the Saxelbye race.
      He dined alone, drank rather freely, and declared to himself that Emmeline
      Oldbourne must be his.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile there had unfortunately arisen between the curate and this girl
      some sweet and secret understanding. Particulars of the attachment
      remained unknown then and always, but it was plainly not approved of by
      her father. His procedure was cold, hard, and inexorable. Soon the curate
      disappeared from the parish, almost suddenly, after bitter and hard words
      had been heard to pass between him and the rector one evening in the
      garden, intermingled with which, like the cries of the dying in the din of
      battle, were the beseeching sobs of a woman. Not long after this it was
      announced that a marriage between the Duke and Miss Oldbourne was to be
      solemnized at a surprisingly early date.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wedding-day came and passed; and she was a Duchess. Nobody seemed to
      think of the ousted man during the day, or else those who thought of him
      concealed their meditations. Some of the less subservient ones were
      disposed to speak in a jocular manner of the august husband and wife,
      others to make correct and pretty speeches about them, according as their
      sex and nature dictated. But in the evening, the ringers in the belfry,
      with whom Alwyn had been a favourite, eased their minds a little
      concerning the gentle young man, and the possible regrets of the woman he
      had loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't you see something wrong in it all?' said the third bell as he wiped
      his face. 'I know well enough where she would have liked to stable her
      horses to-night, when they have done their journey.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That is, you would know if you could tell where young Mr. Hill is living,
      which is known to none in the parish.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Except to the lady that this ring o' grandsire triples is in honour of.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet these friendly cottagers were at this time far from suspecting the
      real dimensions of Emmeline's misery, nor was it clear even to those who
      came into much closer communion with her than they, so well had she
      concealed her heart-sickness. But bride and bridegroom had not long been
      home at the castle when the young wife's unhappiness became plainly enough
      perceptible. Her maids and men said that she was in the habit of turning
      to the wainscot and shedding stupid scalding tears at a time when a
      right-minded lady would have been overhauling her wardrobe. She prayed
      earnestly in the great church-pew, where she sat lonely and insignificant
      as a mouse in a cell, instead of counting her rings, falling asleep, or
      amusing herself in silent laughter at the queer old people in the
      congregation, as previous beauties of the family had done in their time.
      She seemed to care no more for eating and drinking out of crystal and
      silver than from a service of earthen vessels. Her head was, in truth,
      full of something else; and that such was the case was only too obvious to
      the Duke, her husband. At first he would only taunt her for her folly in
      thinking of that milk-and-water parson; but as time went on his charges
      took a more positive shape. He would not believe her assurance that she
      had in no way communicated with her former lover, nor he with her, since
      their parting in the presence of her father. This led to some strange
      scenes between them which need not be detailed; their result was soon to
      take a catastrophic shape.
    </p>
    <p>
      One dark quiet evening, about two months after the marriage, a man entered
      the gate admitting from the highway to the park and avenue which ran up to
      the house. He arrived within two hundred yards of the walls, when he left
      the gravelled drive and drew near to the castle by a roundabout path
      leading into a shrubbery. Here he stood still. In a few minutes the
      strokes of the castle-clock resounded, and then a female figure entered
      the same secluded nook from an opposite direction. There the two
      indistinct persons leapt together like a pair of dewdrops on a leaf; and
      then they stood apart, facing each other, the woman looking down.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Emmeline, you begged me to come, and here I am, Heaven forgive me!' said
      the man hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are going to emigrate, Alwyn,' she said in broken accents. 'I have
      heard of it; you sail from Plymouth in three days in the Western Glory?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. I can live in England no longer. Life is as death to me here,' says
      he.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My life is even worse-worse than death. Death would not have driven me to
      this extremity. Listen, Alwyn-I have sent for you to beg to go with you,
      or at least to be near you-to do anything so that it be not to stay here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'To go away with me?' he said in a startled tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, yes-or under your direction, or by your help in some way! Don't be
      horrified at me-you must bear with me whilst I implore it. Nothing short
      of cruelty would have driven me to this. I could have borne my doom in
      silence had I been left unmolested; but he tortures me, and I shall soon
      be in the grave if I cannot escape.'
    </p>
    <p>
      To his shocked inquiry how her husband tortured her, the Duchess said that
      it was by jealousy. 'He tries to wring admissions from me concerning you,'
      she said, 'and will not believe that I have not communicated with you
      since my engagement to him was settled by my father, and I was forced to
      agree to it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor curate said that this was the heaviest news of all. 'He has not
      personally ill-used you?' he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What has he done?'
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked fearfully around, and said, sobbing: 'In trying to make me
      confess to what I have never done, he adopts plans I dare not describe for
      terrifying me into a weak state, so that I may own to anything! I resolved
      to write to you, as I had no other friend.' She added, with dreary irony,
      'I thought I would give him some ground for his suspicion, so as not to
      disgrace his judgment.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you really mean, Emmeline,' he tremblingly inquired, 'that you-that
      you want to fly with me?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Can you think that I would act otherwise than in earnest at such a time
      as this?'
    </p>
    <p>
      He was silent for a minute or more. 'You must not go with me,' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It would be sin.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It cannot be sin, for I have never wanted to commit sin in my life; and
      it isn't likely I would begin now, when I pray every day to die and be
      sent to Heaven out of my misery!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But it is wrong, Emmeline, all the same.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is it wrong to run away from the fire that scorches you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It would look wrong, at any rate, in this case.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Alwyn, Alwyn, take me, I beseech you!' she burst out. 'It is not right in
      general, I know, but it is such an exceptional instance, this. Why has
      such a severe strain been put upon me? I was doing no harm, injuring no
      one, helping many people, and expecting happiness; yet trouble came. Can
      it be that God holds me in derision? I had no supporter-I gave way; and
      now my life is a burden and a shame to me . . . Oh, if you only knew how
      much to me this request to you is-how my life is wrapped up in it, you
      could not deny me!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'This is almost beyond endurance-Heaven support us,' he groaned. 'Emmy,
      you are the Duchess of Hamptonshire, the Duke of Hamptonshire's wife; you
      must not go with me!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And am I then refused?-Oh, am I refused?' she cried frantically. 'Alwyn,
      Alwyn, do you say it indeed to me?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, I do, dear, tender heart! I do most sadly say it. You must not go.
      Forgive me, for there is no alternative but refusal. Though I die, though
      you die, we must not fly together. It is forbidden in God's law. Good-bye,
      for always and ever!'
    </p>
    <p>
      He tore himself away, hastened from the shrubbery, and vanished among the
      trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three days after this meeting and farewell, Alwyn, his soft, handsome
      features stamped with a haggard hardness that ten years of ordinary wear
      and tear in the world could scarcely have produced, sailed from Plymouth
      on a drizzling morning, in the passenger-ship Western Glory. When the land
      had faded behind him he mechanically endeavoured to school himself into a
      stoical frame of mind. His attempt, backed up by the strong moral staying
      power that had enabled him to resist the passionate temptation to which
      Emmeline, in her reckless trustfulness, had exposed him, was rewarded by a
      certain kind of success, though the murmuring stretch of waters whereon he
      gazed day after day too often seemed to be articulating to him in tones of
      her well-remembered voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      He framed on his journey rules of conduct for reducing to mild proportions
      the feverish regrets which would occasionally arise and agitate him, when
      he indulged in visions of what might have been had he not hearkened to the
      whispers of conscience. He fixed his thoughts for so many hours a day on
      philosophical passages in the volumes he had brought with him, allowing
      himself now and then a few minutes' thought of Emmeline, with the strict
      yet reluctant niggardliness of an ailing epicure proportioning the rank
      drinks that cause his malady. The voyage was marked by the usual incidents
      of a sailing-passage in those days-a storm, a calm, a man overboard, a
      birth, and a funeral-the latter sad event being one in which he, as the
      only clergyman on board, officiated, reading the service ordained for the
      purpose. The ship duly arrived at Boston early in the month following, and
      thence he proceeded to Providence to seek out a distant relative.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a short stay at Providence he returned again to Boston, and by
      applying himself to a serious occupation made good progress in shaking off
      the dreary melancholy which enveloped him even now. Distracted and
      weakened in his beliefs by his recent experiences, he decided that he
      could not for a time worthily fill the office of a minister of religion,
      and applied for the mastership of a school. Some introductions, given him
      before starting, were useful now, and he soon became known as a
      respectable scholar and gentleman to the trustees of one of the colleges.
      This ultimately led to his retirement from the school and installation in
      the college as Professor of rhetoric and oratory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here and thus he lived on, exerting himself solely because of a
      conscientious determination to do his duty. He passed his winter evenings
      in turning sonnets and elegies, often giving his thoughts voice in 'Lines
      to an Unfortunate Lady,' while his summer leisure at the same hour would
      be spent in watching the lengthening shadows from his window, and
      fancifully comparing them with the shades of his own life. If he walked,
      he mentally inquired which was the eastern quarter of the landscape, and
      thought of two thousand miles of water that way, and of what was beyond
      it. In a word he was at all spare times dreaming of her who was only a
      memory to him, and would probably never be more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nine years passed by, and under their wear and tear Alwyn Hill's face lost
      a great many of the attractive characteristics which had formerly
      distinguished it. He was kind to his pupils and affable to all who came in
      contact with him; but the kernel of his life, his secret, was kept as
      snugly shut up as though he had been dumb. In talking to his acquaintances
      of England and his life there, he omitted the episode of Batton Castle and
      Emmeline as if it had no existence in his calendar at all. Though of
      towering importance to himself, it had filled but a short and small
      fragment of time, an ephemeral season which would have been wellnigh
      imperceptible, even to him, at this distance, but for the incident it
      enshrined.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, at this date, when cursorily glancing over an old English
      newspaper, he observed a paragraph which, short as it was, contained for
      him whole tomes of thrilling information-rung with more passion-stirring
      rhythm than the collected cantos of all the poets. It was an announcement
      of the death of the Duke of Hamptonshire, leaving behind him a widow, but
      no children.
    </p>
    <p>
      The current of Alwyn's thoughts now completely changed. On looking again
      at the newspaper he found it to be one that was sent him long ago, and had
      been carelessly thrown aside. But for an accidental overhauling of the
      waste journals in his study he might not have known of the event for
      years. At this moment of reading the Duke had already been dead seven
      months. Alwyn could now no longer bind himself down to machine- made
      synecdoche, antithesis, and climax, being full of spontaneous specimens of
      all these rhetorical forms, which he dared not utter. Who shall wonder
      that his mind luxuriated in dreams of a sweet possibility now laid open
      for the first time these many years? for Emmeline was to him now as ever
      the one dear thing in all the world. The issue of his silent romancing was
      that he resolved to return to her at the very earliest moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he could not abandon his professional work on the instant. He did not
      get really quite free from engagements till four months later; but, though
      suffering throes of impatience continually, he said to himself every day:
      'If she has continued to love me nine years she will love me ten; she will
      think the more tenderly of me when her present hours of solitude shall
      have done their proper work; old times will revive with the cessation of
      her recent experience, and every day will favour my return.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The enforced interval soon passed, and he duly arrived in England,
      reaching the village of Batton on a certain winter day between twelve and
      thirteen months subsequent to the time of the Duke's death.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was evening; yet such was Alwyn's impatience that he could not forbear
      taking, this very night, one look at the castle which Emmeline had entered
      as unhappy mistress ten years before. He threaded the park trees, gazed in
      passing at well-known outlines which rose against the dim sky, and was
      soon interested in observing that lively country- people, in parties of
      two and three, were walking before and behind him up the interlaced avenue
      to the castle gateway. Knowing himself to be safe from recognition, Alwyn
      inquired of one of these pedestrians what was going on.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Her Grace gives her tenantry a ball to-night, to keep up the old custom
      of the Duke and his father before him, which she does not wish to change.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Indeed. Has she lived here entirely alone since the Duke's death?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Quite alone. But though she doesn't receive company herself, she likes
      the village people to enjoy themselves, and often has 'em here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Kind-hearted, as always!' thought Alwyn.
    </p>
    <p>
      On reaching the castle he found that the great gates at the tradesmen's
      entrance were thrown back against the wall as if they were never to be
      closed again; that the passages and rooms in that wing were brilliantly
      lighted up, some of the numerous candles guttering down over the green
      leaves which decorated them, and upon the silk dresses of the happy
      farmers' wives as they passed beneath, each on her husband's arm. Alwyn
      found no difficulty in marching in along with the rest, the castle being
      Liberty Hall to-night. He stood unobserved in a corner of the large
      apartment where dancing was about to begin.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Her Grace, though hardly out of mourning, will be sure to come down and
      lead off the dance with neighbour Bates,' said one.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who is neighbour Bates?' asked Alwyn.
    </p>
    <p>
      'An old man she respects much-the oldest of her tenant-farmers. He was
      seventy-eight his last birthday.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, to be sure!' said Alwyn, at his ease. 'I remember.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The dancers formed in line, and waited. A door opened at the farther end
      of the hall, and a lady in black silk came forth. She bowed, smiled, and
      proceeded to the top of the dance.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who is that lady?' said Alwyn, in a puzzled tone. 'I thought you told me
      that the Duchess of Hamptonshire-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That is the Duchess,' said his informant.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But there is another?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No; there is no other.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But she is not the Duchess of Hamptonshire-who used to-' Alwyn's tongue
      stuck to his mouth, he could get no farther.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What's the matter?' said his acquaintance. Alwyn had retired, and was
      supporting himself against the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wretched Alwyn murmured something about a stitch in his side from
      walking. Then the music struck up, the dance went on, and his neighbour
      became so interested in watching the movements of this strange Duchess
      through its mazes as to forget Alwyn for a while.
    </p>
    <p>
      It gave him an opportunity to brace himself up. He was a man who had
      suffered, and he could suffer again. 'How came that person to be your
      Duchess?' he asked in a firm, distinct voice, when he had attained
      complete self-command. 'Where is her other Grace of Hamptonshire? There
      certainly was another. I know it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, the previous one! Yes, yes. She ran away years and years ago with the
      young curate. Mr. Hill was the young man's name, if I recollect.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No! She never did. What do you mean by that?' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, she certainly ran away. She met the curate in the shrubbery about a
      couple of months after her marriage with the Duke. There were folks who
      saw the meeting and heard some words of their talk. They arranged to go,
      and she sailed from Plymouth with him a day or two afterward.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's not true.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then 'tis the queerest lie ever told by man. Her father believed and knew
      to his dying day that she went with him; and so did the Duke, and
      everybody about here. Ay, there was a fine upset about it at the time. The
      Duke traced her to Plymouth.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Traced her to Plymouth?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He traced her to Plymouth, and set on his spies; and they found that she
      went to the shipping-office, and inquired if Mr. Alwyn Hill had entered
      his name as passenger by the Western Glory; and when she found that he
      had, she booked herself for the same ship, but not in her real name. When
      the vessel had sailed a letter reached the Duke from her, telling him what
      she had done. She never came back here again. His Grace lived by himself a
      number of years, and married this lady only twelve months before he died.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Alwyn was in a state of indescribable bewilderment. But, unmanned as he
      was, he called the next day on the, to him, spurious Duchess of
      Hamptonshire. At first she was alarmed at his statement, then cold, then
      she was won over by his condition to give confidence for confidence. She
      showed him a letter which had been found among the papers of the late
      Duke, corroborating what Alwyn's informant had detailed. It was from
      Emmeline, bearing the postmarked date at which the Western Glory sailed,
      and briefly stated that she had emigrated by that ship to America.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alwyn applied himself body and mind to unravel the remainder of the
      mystery. The story repeated to him was always the same: 'She ran away with
      the curate.' A strangely circumstantial piece of intelligence was added to
      this when he had pushed his inquiries a little further. There was given
      him the name of a waterman at Plymouth, who had come forward at the time
      that she was missed and sought for by her husband, and had stated that he
      put her on board the Western Glory at dusk one evening before that vessel
      sailed.
    </p>
    <p>
      After several days of search about the alleys and quays of Plymouth
      Barbican, during which these impossible words, 'She ran off with the
      curate,' became branded on his brain, Alwyn found this important waterman.
      He was positive as to the truth of his story, still remembering the
      incident well, and he described in detail the lady's dress, as he had long
      ago described it to her husband, which description corresponded in every
      particular with the dress worn by Emmeline on the evening of their
      parting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before proceeding to the other side of the Atlantic to continue his
      inquiries there, the puzzled and distracted Alwyn set himself to ascertain
      the address of Captain Wheeler, who had commanded the Western Glory in the
      year of Alwyn's voyage out, and immediately wrote a letter to him on the
      subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only circumstances which the sailor could recollect or discover from
      his papers in connection with such a story were, that a woman bearing the
      name which Alwyn had mentioned as fictitious certainly did come aboard for
      a voyage he made about that time; that she took a common berth among the
      poorest emigrants; that she died on the voyage out, at about five days'
      sail from Plymouth; that she seemed a lady in manners and education. Why
      she had not applied for a first-class passage, why she had no trunks, they
      could not guess, for though she had little money in her pocket she had
      that about her which would have fetched it. 'We buried her at sea,'
      continued the captain. 'A young parson, one of the cabin-passengers, read
      the burial-service over her, I remember well.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole scene and proceedings darted upon Alwyn's recollection in a
      moment. It was a fine breezy morning on that long-past voyage out, and he
      had been told that they were running at the rate of a hundred and odd
      miles a day. The news went round that one of the poor young women in the
      other part of the vessel was ill of fever, and delirious. The tidings
      caused no little alarm among all the passengers, for the sanitary
      conditions of the ship were anything but satisfactory. Shortly after this
      the doctor announced that she had died. Then Alwyn had learnt that she was
      laid out for burial in great haste, because of the danger that would have
      been incurred by delay. And next the funeral scene rose before him, and
      the prominent part that he had taken in that solemn ceremony. The captain
      had come to him, requesting him to officiate, as there was no chaplain on
      board. This he had agreed to do; and as the sun went down with a blaze in
      his face he read amidst them all assembled: 'We therefore commit her body
      to the deep, to be turned into corruption, looking for the resurrection of
      the body when the sea shall give up her dead.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain also forwarded the addresses of the ship's matron and of other
      persons who had been engaged on board at the date. To these Alwyn went in
      the course of time. A categorical description of the clothes of the dead
      truant, the colour of her hair, and other things, extinguished for ever
      all hope of a mistake in identity.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, then, the course of events had become clear. On that unhappy
      evening when he left Emmeline in the shrubbery, forbidding her to follow
      him because it would be a sin, she must have disobeyed. She must have
      followed at his heels silently through the darkness, like a poor pet
      animal that will not be driven back. She could have accumulated nothing
      for the journey more than she might have carried in her hand; and thus
      poorly provided she must have embarked. Her intention had doubtless been
      to make her presence on board known to him as soon as she could muster
      courage to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the ten years' chapter of Alwyn Hill's romance wound itself up under
      his eyes. That the poor young woman in the steerage had been the young
      Duchess of Hamptonshire was never publicly disclosed. Hill had no longer
      any reason for remaining in England, and soon after left its shores with
      no intention to return. Previous to his departure he confided his story to
      an old friend from his native town-grandfather of the person who now
      relates it to you.

    <p>
      A few members, including the Bookworm, seemed to be impressed by the quiet
      gentleman's tale; but the member we have called the Spark-who, by the way,
      was getting somewhat tinged with the light of other days, and owned to
      eight-and-thirty-walked daintily about the room instead of sitting down by
      the fire with the majority and said that for his part he preferred
      something more lively than the last story-something in which such
      long-separated lovers were ultimately united. He also liked stories that
      were more modern in their date of action than those he had heard to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Members immediately requested him to give them a specimen, to which the
      Spark replied that he didn't mind, as far as that went. And though the
      Vice-President, the Man of Family, the Colonel, and others, looked at
      their watches, and said they must soon retire to their respective quarters
      in the hotel adjoining, they all decided to sit out the Spark's story.

    <h2>
      DAME THE TENTH-THE HONOURABLE LAURA
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By the Spark
    </h3>
    <p>
      It was a cold and gloomy Christmas Eve. The mass of cloud overhead was
      almost impervious to such daylight as still lingered on; the snow lay
      several inches deep upon the ground, and the slanting downfall which still
      went on threatened to considerably increase its thickness before the
      morning. The Prospect Hotel, a building standing near the wild north coast
      of Lower Wessex, looked so lonely and so useless at such a time as this
      that a passing wayfarer would have been led to forget summer
      possibilities, and to wonder at the commercial courage which could invest
      capital, on the basis of the popular taste for the picturesque, in a
      country subject to such dreary phases. That the district was alive with
      visitors in August seemed but a dim tradition in weather so totally
      opposed to all that tempts mankind from home. However, there the hotel
      stood immovable; and the cliffs, creeks, and headlands which were the
      primary attractions of the spot, rising in full view on the opposite side
      of the valley, were now but stern angular outlines, while the townlet in
      front was tinged over with a grimy dirtiness rather than the pearly gray
      that in summer lent such beauty to its appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within the hotel commanding this outlook the landlord walked idly about
      with his hands in his pockets, not in the least expectant of a visitor,
      and yet unable to settle down to any occupation which should compensate in
      some degree for the losses that winter idleness entailed on his regular
      profession. So little, indeed, was anybody expected, that the coffee-room
      waiter-a genteel boy, whose plated buttons in summer were as close
      together upon the front of his short jacket as peas in a pod-now appeared
      in the back yard, metamorphosed into the unrecognizable shape of a rough
      country lad in corduroys and hobnailed boots, sweeping the snow away, and
      talking the local dialect in all its purity, quite oblivious of the new
      polite accent he had learned in the hot weather from the well-behaved
      visitors. The front door was closed, and, as if to express still more
      fully the sealed and chrysalis state of the establishment, a sand-bag was
      placed at the bottom to keep out the insidious snowdrift, the wind setting
      in directly from that quarter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlord, entering his own parlour, walked to the large fire which it
      was absolutely necessary to keep up for his comfort, no such blaze burning
      in the coffee-room or elsewhere, and after giving it a stir returned to a
      table in the lobby, whereon lay the visitors' book-now closed and pushed
      back against the wall. He carelessly opened it; not a name had been
      entered there since the 19th of the previous November, and that was only
      the name of a man who had arrived on a tricycle, who, indeed, had not been
      asked to enter at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he was engaged thus the evening grew darker; but before it was as
      yet too dark to distinguish objects upon the road winding round the back
      of the cliffs, the landlord perceived a black spot on the distant white,
      which speedily enlarged itself and drew near. The probabilities were that
      this vehicle-for a vehicle of some sort it seemed to be-would pass by and
      pursue its way to the nearest railway-town as others had done. But,
      contrary to the landlord's expectation, as he stood conning it through the
      yet unshuttered windows, the solitary object, on reaching the corner,
      turned into the hotel-front, and drove up to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a conveyance particularly unsuited to such a season and weather,
      being nothing more substantial than an open basket-carriage drawn by a
      single horse. Within sat two persons, of different sexes, as could soon be
      discerned, in spite of their muffled attire. The man held the reins, and
      the lady had got some shelter from the storm by clinging close to his
      side. The landlord rang the hostler's bell to attract the attention of the
      stable-man, for the approach of the visitors had been deadened to
      noiselessness by the snow, and when the hostler had come to the horse's
      head the gentleman and lady alighted, the landlord meeting them in the
      hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The male stranger was a foreign-looking individual of about eight-and-
      twenty. He was close-shaven, excepting a moustache, his features being
      good, and even handsome. The lady, who stood timidly behind him, seemed to
      be much younger-possibly not more than eighteen, though it was difficult
      to judge either of her age or appearance in her present wrappings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman expressed his wish to stay till the morning, explaining
      somewhat unnecessarily, considering that the house was an inn, that they
      had been unexpectedly benighted on their drive. Such a welcome being given
      them as landlords can give in dull times, the latter ordered fires in the
      drawing and coffee-rooms, and went to the boy in the yard, who soon
      scrubbed himself up, dragged his disused jacket from its box, polished the
      buttons with his sleeve, and appeared civilized in the hall. The lady was
      shown into a room where she could take off her snow- damped garments,
      which she sent down to be dried, her companion, meanwhile, putting a
      couple of sovereigns on the table, as if anxious to make everything smooth
      and comfortable at starting, and requesting that a private sitting-room
      might be got ready. The landlord assured him that the best upstairs
      parlour-usually public-should be kept private this evening, and sent the
      maid to light the candles. Dinner was prepared for them, and, at the
      gentleman's desire, served in the same apartment; where, the young lady
      having joined him, they were left to the rest and refreshment they seemed
      to need.
    </p>
    <p>
      That something was peculiar in the relations of the pair had more than
      once struck the landlord, though wherein that peculiarity lay it was hard
      to decide. But that his guest was one who paid his way readily had been
      proved by his conduct, and dismissing conjectures, he turned to practical
      affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      About nine o'clock he re-entered the hall, and, everything being done for
      the day, again walked up and down, occasionally gazing through the glass
      door at the prospect without, to ascertain how the weather was
      progressing. Contrary to prognostication, snow had ceased falling, and,
      with the rising of the moon, the sky had partially cleared, light fleeces
      of cloud drifting across the silvery disk. There was every sign that a
      frost was going to set in later on. For these reasons the distant rising
      road was even more distinct now between its high banks than it had been in
      the declining daylight. Not a track or rut broke the virgin surface of the
      white mantle that lay along it, all marks left by the lately arrived
      travellers having been speedily obliterated by the flakes falling at the
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now the landlord beheld by the light of the moon a sight very similar
      to that he had seen by the light of day. Again a black spot was advancing
      down the road that margined the coast. He was in a moment or two enabled
      to perceive that the present vehicle moved onward at a more headlong pace
      than the little carriage which had preceded it; next, that it was a
      brougham drawn by two powerful horses; next, that this carriage, like the
      former one, was bound for the hotel-door. This desirable feature of
      resemblance caused the landlord to once more withdraw the sand-bag and
      advance into the porch.
    </p>
    <p>
      An old gentleman was the first to alight. He was followed by a young one,
      and both unhesitatingly came forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Has a young lady, less than nineteen years of age, recently arrived here
      in the company of a man some years her senior?' asked the old gentleman,
      in haste. 'A man cleanly shaven for the most part, having the appearance
      of an opera-singer, and calling himself Signor Smithozzi?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'We have had arrivals lately,' said the landlord, in the tone of having
      had twenty at least-not caring to acknowledge the attenuated state of
      business that afflicted Prospect Hotel in winter.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And among them can your memory recall two persons such as those I
      describe?-the man a sort of baritone?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'There certainly is or was a young couple staying in the hotel; but I
      could not pronounce on the compass of the gentleman's voice.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, no; of course not. I am quite bewildered. They arrived in a
      basket-carriage, altogether badly provided?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'They came in a carriage, I believe, as most of our visitors do.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, yes. I must see them at once. Pardon my want of ceremony, and show
      us in to where they are.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But, sir, you forget. Suppose the lady and gentleman I mean are not the
      lady and gentleman you mean? It would be awkward to allow you to rush in
      upon them just now while they are at dinner, and might cause me to lose
      their future patronage.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'True, true. They may not be the same persons. My anxiety, I perceive,
      makes me rash in my assumptions!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Upon the whole, I think they must be the same, Uncle Quantock,' said the
      young man, who had not till now spoken. And turning to the landlord: 'You
      possibly have not such a large assemblage of visitors here, on this
      somewhat forbidding evening, that you quite forget how this couple
      arrived, and what the lady wore?' His tone of addressing the landlord had
      in it a quiet frigidity that was not without irony.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah! what she wore; that's it, James. What did she wear?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't usually take stock of my guests' clothing,' replied the landlord
      drily, for the ready money of the first arrival had decidedly biassed him
      in favour of that gentleman's cause. 'You can certainly see some of it if
      you want to,' he added carelessly, 'for it is drying by the kitchen fire.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the words were half out of his mouth the old gentleman had
      exclaimed, 'Ah!' and precipitated himself along what seemed to be the
      passage to the kitchen; but as this turned out to be only the entrance to
      a dark china-closet, he hastily emerged again, after a collision with the
      inn-crockery had told him of his mistake.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I beg your pardon, I'm sure; but if you only knew my feelings (which I
      cannot at present explain), you would make allowances. Anything I have
      broken I will willingly pay for.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't mention it, sir,' said the landlord. And showing the way, they
      adjourned to the kitchen without further parley. The eldest of the party
      instantly seized the lady's cloak, that hung upon a clothes-horse,
      exclaiming: 'Ah! yes, James, it is hers. I knew we were on their track.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, it is hers,' answered the nephew quietly, for he was much less
      excited than his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Show us their room at once,' said the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      'William, have the lady and gentleman in the front sitting-room finished
      dining?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, sir, long ago,' said the hundred plated buttons.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then show up these gentlemen to them at once. You stay here to-night,
      gentlemen, I presume? Shall the horses be taken out?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Feed the horses and wash their mouths. Whether we stay or not depends
      upon circumstances,' said the placid younger man, as he followed his uncle
      and the waiter to the staircase.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I think, Nephew James,' said the former, as he paused with his foot on
      the first step-'I think we had better not be announced, but take them by
      surprise. She may go throwing herself out of the window, or do some
      equally desperate thing!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, certainly, we'll enter unannounced.' And he called back the lad who
      preceded them.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I cannot sufficiently thank you, James, for so effectually aiding me in
      this pursuit!' exclaimed the old gentleman, taking the other by the hand.
      'My increasing infirmities would have hindered my overtaking her to-night,
      had it not been for your timely aid.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am only too happy, uncle, to have been of service to you in this or any
      other matter. I only wish I could have accompanied you on a pleasanter
      journey. However, it is advisable to go up to them at once, or they may
      hear us.' And they softly ascended the stairs.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      On the door being opened, a room too large to be comfortable, lit by the
      best branch-candlesticks of the hotel, was disclosed, before the fire of
      which apartment the truant couple were sitting, very innocently looking
      over the hotel scrap-book and the album containing views of the
      neighbourhood. No sooner had the old man entered than the young lady-who
      now showed herself to be quite as young as described, and remarkably
      prepossessing as to features-perceptibly turned pale. When the nephew
      entered, she turned still paler, as if she were going to faint. The young
      man described as an opera-singer rose with grim civility, and placed
      chairs for his visitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Caught you, thank God!' said the old gentleman breathlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, worse luck, my lord!' murmured Signor Smithozzi, in native London-
      English, that distinguished alien having, in fact, first seen the light in
      the vicinity of the City Road. 'She would have been mine to-morrow. And I
      think that under the peculiar circumstances it would be wiser-considering
      how soon the breath of scandal will tarnish a lady's fame-to let her be
      mine to-morrow, just the same.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never!' said the old man. 'Here is a lady under age, without
      experience-child-like in her maiden innocence and virtue-whom you have
      plied by your vile arts, till this morning at dawn-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lord Quantock, were I not bound to respect your gray hairs-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Till this morning at dawn you tempted her away from her father's roof.
      What blame can attach to her conduct that will not, on a full explanation
      of the matter, be readily passed over in her and thrown entirely on you?
      Laura, you return at once with me. I should not have arrived, after all,
      early enough to deliver you, if it had not been for the disinterestedness
      of your cousin, Captain Northbrook, who, on my discovering your flight
      this morning, offered with a promptitude for which I can never
      sufficiently thank him, to accompany me on my journey, as the only male
      relative I have near me. Come, do you hear? Put on your things; we are off
      at once.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't want to go!' pouted the young lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I daresay you don't,' replied her father drily. 'But children never know
      what's best for them. So come along, and trust to my opinion.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura was silent, and did not move, the opera gentleman looking helplessly
      into the fire, and the lady's cousin sitting meditatively calm, as the
      single one of the four whose position enabled him to survey the whole
      escapade with the cool criticism of a comparative outsider.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I say to you, Laura, as the father of a daughter under age, that you
      instantly come with me. What? Would you compel me to use physical force to
      reclaim you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't want to return!' again declared Laura.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is your duty to return nevertheless, and at once, I inform you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't want to!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now, dear Laura, this is what I say: return with me and your cousin James
      quietly, like a good and repentant girl, and nothing will be said. Nobody
      knows what has happened as yet, and if we start at once, we shall be home
      before it is light to-morrow morning. Come.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am not obliged to come at your bidding, father, and I would rather
      not!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Now James, the cousin, during this dialogue might have been observed to
      grow somewhat restless, and even impatient. More than once he had parted
      his lips to speak, but second thoughts each time held him back. The moment
      had come, however, when he could keep silence no longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Come, madam!' he spoke out, 'this farce with your father has, in my
      opinion, gone on long enough. Just make no more ado, and step downstairs
      with us.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave herself an intractable little twist, and did not reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      'By the Lord Harry, Laura, I won't stand this!' he said angrily. 'Come,
      get on your things before I come and compel you. There is a kind of
      compulsion to which this talk is child's play. Come, madam-instantly, I
      say!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The old nobleman turned to his nephew and said mildly: 'Leave me to
      insist, James. It doesn't become you. I can speak to her sharply enough,
      if I choose.'
    </p>
    <p>
      James, however, did not heed his uncle, and went on to the troublesome
      young woman: 'You say you don't want to come, indeed! A pretty story to
      tell me, that! Come, march out of the room at once, and leave that hulking
      fellow for me to deal with afterward. Get on quickly-come!' and he
      advanced toward her as if to pull her by the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nay, nay,' expostulated Laura's father, much surprised at his nephew's
      sudden demeanour. 'You take too much upon yourself. Leave her to me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I won't leave her to you any longer!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You have no right, James, to address either me or her in this way; so
      just hold your tongue. Come, my dear.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have every right!' insisted James.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How do you make that out?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have the right of a husband.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Whose husband?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hers.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She's my wife.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'James!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, to cut a long story short, I may say that she secretly married me,
      in spite of your lordship's prohibition, about three months ago. And I
      must add that, though she cooled down rather quickly, everything went on
      smoothly enough between us for some time; in spite of the awkwardness of
      meeting only by stealth. We were only waiting for a convenient moment to
      break the news to you when this idle Adonis turned up, and after poisoning
      her mind against me, brought her into this disgrace.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the operatic luminary, who had sat in rather an abstracted and
      nerveless attitude till the cousin made his declaration, fired up and
      cried: 'I declare before Heaven that till this moment I never knew she was
      a wife! I found her in her father's house an unhappy girl-unhappy, as I
      believe, because of the loneliness and dreariness of that establishment,
      and the want of society, and for nothing else whatever. What this
      statement about her being your wife means I am quite at a loss to
      understand. Are you indeed married to him, Laura?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura nodded from within her tearful handkerchief. 'It was because of my
      anomalous position in being privately married to him,' she sobbed, 'that I
      was unhappy at home-and-and I didn't like him so well as I did at
      first-and I wished I could get out of the mess I was in! And then I saw
      you a few times, and when you said, "We'll run off," I thought I saw a way
      out of it all, and then I agreed to come with you-oo-oo!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well! well! well! And is this true?' murmured the bewildered old
      nobleman, staring from James to Laura, and from Laura to James, as if he
      fancied they might be figments of the imagination. 'Is this, then, James,
      the secret of your kindness to your old uncle in helping him to find his
      daughter? Good Heavens! What further depths of duplicity are there left
      for a man to learn!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have married her, Uncle Quantock, as I said,' answered James coolly.
      'The deed is done, and can't be undone by talking here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Where were you married?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'At St. Mary's, Toneborough.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'When?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'On the 29th of September, during the time she was visiting there.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who married you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't know. One of the curates-we were quite strangers to the place.
      So, instead of my assisting you to recover her, you may as well assist
      me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never! never!' said Lord Quantock. 'Madam, and sir, I beg to tell you
      that I wash my hands of the whole affair! If you are man and wife, as it
      seems you are, get reconciled as best you may. I have no more to say or do
      with either of you. I leave you, Laura, in the hands of your husband, and
      much joy may you bring him; though the situation, I own, is not
      encouraging.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Saying this, the indignant speaker pushed back his chair against the table
      with such force that the candlesticks rocked on their bases, and left the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura's wet eyes roved from one of the young men to the other, who now
      stood glaring face to face, and, being much frightened at their aspect,
      slipped out of the room after her father. Him, however, she could hear
      going out of the front door, and, not knowing where to take shelter, she
      crept into the darkness of an adjoining bedroom, and there awaited events
      with a palpitating heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the two men remaining in the sitting-room drew nearer to each
      other, and the opera-singer broke the silence by saying, 'How could you
      insult me in the way you did, calling me a fellow, and accusing me of
      poisoning her mind toward you, when you knew very well I was as ignorant
      of your relation to her as an unborn babe?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh yes, you were quite ignorant; I can believe that readily,' sneered
      Laura's husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I here call Heaven to witness that I never knew!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Recitativo-the rhythm excellent, and the tone well sustained. Is it
      likely that any man could win the confidence of a young fool her age, and
      not get that out of her? Preposterous! Tell it to the most improved new
      pit-stalls.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Captain Northbrook, your insinuations are as despicable as your wretched
      person!' cried the baritone, losing all patience. And springing forward he
      slapped the captain in the face with the palm of his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Northbrook flinched but slightly, and calmly using his handkerchief to
      learn if his nose was bleeding, said, 'I quite expected this insult, so I
      came prepared.' And he drew forth from a black valise which he carried in
      his hand a small case of pistols.
    </p>
    <p>
      The baritone started at the unexpected sight, but recovering from his
      surprise said, 'Very well, as you will,' though perhaps his tone showed a
      slight want of confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now,' continued the husband, quite confidingly, 'we want no parade, no
      nonsense, you know. Therefore we'll dispense with seconds?'
    </p>
    <p>
      The signor slightly nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you know this part of the country well?' Cousin James went on, in the
      same cool and still manner. 'If you don't, I do. Quite at the bottom of
      the rocks out there, just beyond the stream which falls over them to the
      shore, is a smooth sandy space, not so much shut in as to be out of the
      moonlight; and the way down to it from this side is over steps cut in the
      cliff; and we can find our way down without trouble. We-we two-will find
      our way down; but only one of us will find his way up, you understand?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Quite.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then suppose we start; the sooner it is over the better. We can order
      supper before we go out-supper for two; for though we are three at
      present-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Three?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes; you and I and she-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      '-We shall be only two by and by; so that, as I say, we will order supper
      for two; for the lady and a gentleman. Whichever comes back alive will tap
      at her door, and call her in to share the repast with him-she's not off
      the premises. But we must not alarm her now; and above all things we must
      not let the inn-people see us go out; it would look so odd for two to go
      out, and only one come in. Ha! ha!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ha! ha! exactly.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Are you ready?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh-quite.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then I'll lead the way.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He went softly to the door and downstairs, ordering supper to be ready in
      an hour, as he had said; then making a feint of returning to the room
      again, he beckoned to the singer, and together they slipped out of the
      house by a side door.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The sky was now quite clear, and the wheelmarks of the brougham which had
      borne away Laura's father, Lord Quantock, remained distinctly visible.
      Soon the verge of the down was reached, the captain leading the way, and
      the baritone following silently, casting furtive glances at his companion,
      and beyond him at the scene ahead. In due course they arrived at the chasm
      in the cliff which formed the waterfall. The outlook here was wild and
      picturesque in the extreme, and fully justified the many praises,
      paintings, and photographic views to which the spot had given birth. What
      in summer was charmingly green and gray, was now rendered weird and
      fantastic by the snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      From their feet the cascade plunged downward almost vertically to a depth
      of eighty or a hundred feet before finally losing itself in the sand, and
      though the stream was but small, its impact upon jutting rocks in its
      descent divided it into a hundred spirts and splashes that sent up a mist
      into the upper air. A few marginal drippings had been frozen into icicles,
      but the centre flowed on unimpeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The operatic artist looked down as he halted, but his thoughts were
      plainly not of the beauty of the scene. His companion with the pistols was
      immediately in front of him, and there was no handrail on the side of the
      path toward the chasm. Obeying a quick impulse, he stretched out his arm,
      and with a superhuman thrust sent Laura's husband reeling over. A whirling
      human shape, diminishing downward in the moon's rays farther and farther
      toward invisibility, a smack-smack upon the projecting ledges of rock-at
      first louder and heavier than that of the brook, and then scarcely to be
      distinguished from it-then a cessation, then the splashing of the stream
      as before, and the accompanying murmur of the sea, were all the incidents
      that disturbed the customary flow of the little waterfall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The singer waited in a fixed attitude for a few minutes, then turning, he
      rapidly retraced his steps over the intervening upland toward the road,
      and in less than a quarter of an hour was at the door of the hotel.
      Slipping quietly in as the clock struck ten, he said to the landlord, over
      the bar hatchway-
    </p>
    <p>
      'The bill as soon as you can let me have it, including charges for the
      supper that was ordered, though we cannot stay to eat it, I am sorry to
      say.' He added with forced gaiety, 'The lady's father and cousin have
      thought better of intercepting the marriage, and after quarrelling with
      each other have gone home independently.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well done, sir!' said the landlord, who still sided with this customer in
      preference to those who had given trouble and barely paid for baiting the
      horses. '"Love will find out the way!" as the saying is. Wish you joy,
      sir!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Signor Smithozzi went upstairs, and on entering the sitting-room found
      that Laura had crept out from the dark adjoining chamber in his absence.
      She looked up at him with eyes red from weeping, and with symptoms of
      alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What is it?-where is he?' she said apprehensively.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Captain Northbrook has gone back. He says he will have no more to do with
      you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And I am quite abandoned by them!-and they'll forget me, and nobody care
      about me any more!' She began to cry afresh.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But it is the luckiest thing that could have happened. All is just as it
      was before they came disturbing us. But, Laura, you ought to have told me
      about that private marriage, though it is all the same now; it will be
      dissolved, of course. You are a wid-virtually a widow.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is no use to reproach me for what is past. What am I to do now?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'We go at once to Cliff-Martin. The horse has rested thoroughly these last
      three hours, and he will have no difficulty in doing an additional
      half-dozen miles. We shall be there before twelve, and there are late
      taverns in the place, no doubt. There we'll sell both horse and carriage
      to-morrow morning; and go by the coach to Downstaple. Once in the train we
      are safe.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I agree to anything,' she said listlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      In about ten minutes the horse was put in, the bill paid, the lady's dried
      wraps put round her, and the journey resumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When about a mile on their way, they saw a glimmering light in advance of
      them. 'I wonder what that is?' said the baritone, whose manner had
      latterly become nervous, every sound and sight causing him to turn his
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is only a turnpike,' said she. 'That light is the lamp kept burning
      over the door.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of course, of course, dearest. How stupid I am!'
    </p>
    <p>
      On reaching the gate they perceived that a man on foot had approached it,
      apparently by some more direct path than the roadway they pursued, and
      was, at the moment they drew up, standing in conversation with the
      gatekeeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is quite impossible that he could fall over the cliff by accident or
      the will of God on such a light night as this,' the pedestrian was saying.
      'These two children I tell you of saw two men go along the path toward the
      waterfall, and ten minutes later only one of 'em came back, walking fast,
      like a man who wanted to get out of the way because he had done something
      queer. There is no manner of doubt that he pushed the other man over, and,
      mark me, it will soon cause a hue and cry for that man.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The candle shone in the face of the Signor and showed that there had
      arisen upon it a film of ghastliness. Laura, glancing toward him for a few
      moments observed it, till, the gatekeeper having mechanically swung open
      the gate, her companion drove through, and they were soon again enveloped
      in the white silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her conductor had said to Laura, just before, that he meant to inquire the
      way at this turnpike; but he had certainly not done so.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as they had gone a little farther the omission, intentional or
      not, began to cause them some trouble. Beyond the secluded district which
      they now traversed ran the more frequented road, where progress would be
      easy, the snow being probably already beaten there to some extent by
      traffic; but they had not yet reached it, and having no one to guide them
      their journey began to appear less feasible than it had done before
      starting. When the little lane which they had entered ascended another
      hill, and seemed to wind round in a direction contrary to the expected
      route to Cliff-Martin, the question grew serious. Ever since overhearing
      the conversation at the turnpike, Laura had maintained a perfect silence,
      and had even shrunk somewhat away from the side of her lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why don't you talk, Laura,' he said with forced buoyancy, 'and suggest
      the way we should go?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh yes, I will,' she responded, a curious fearfulness being audible in
      her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this she uttered a few occasional sentences which seemed to persuade
      him that she suspected nothing. At last he drew rein, and the weary horse
      stood still.
    </p>
    <p>
      'We are in a fix,' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She answered eagerly: 'I'll hold the reins while you run forward to the
      top of the ridge, and see if the road takes a favourable turn beyond. It
      would give the horse a few minutes' rest, and if you find out no change in
      the direction, we will retrace this lane, and take the other turning.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The expedient seemed a good one in the circumstances, especially when
      recommended by the singular eagerness of her voice; and placing the reins
      in her hands-a quite unnecessary precaution, considering the state of
      their hack-he stepped out and went forward through the snow till she could
      see no more of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner was he gone than Laura, with a rapidity which contrasted
      strangely with her previous stillness, made fast the reins to the corner
      of the phaeton, and slipping out on the opposite side, ran back with all
      her might down the hill, till, coming to an opening in the fence, she
      scrambled through it, and plunged into the copse which bordered this
      portion of the lane. Here she stood in hiding under one of the large
      bushes, clinging so closely to its umbrage as to seem but a portion of its
      mass, and listening intently for the faintest sound of pursuit. But
      nothing disturbed the stillness save the occasional slipping of gathered
      snow from the boughs, or the rustle of some wild animal over the crisp
      flake-bespattered herbage. At length, apparently convinced that her former
      companion was either unable to find her, or not anxious to do so, in the
      present strange state of affairs, she crept out from the bushes, and in
      less than an hour found herself again approaching the door of the Prospect
      Hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she drew near, Laura could see that, far from being wrapped in
      darkness, as she might have expected, there were ample signs that all the
      tenants were on the alert, lights moving about the open space in front.
      Satisfaction was expressed in her face when she discerned that no
      reappearance of her baritone and his pony-carriage was causing this
      sensation; but it speedily gave way to grief and dismay when she saw by
      the lights the form of a man borne on a stretcher by two others into the
      porch of the hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have caused all this,' she murmured between her quivering lips. 'He has
      murdered him!' Running forward to the door, she hastily asked of the first
      person she met if the man on the stretcher was dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, miss,' said the labourer addressed, eyeing her up and down as an
      unexpected apparition. 'He is still alive, they say, but not sensible. He
      either fell or was pushed over the waterfall; 'tis thoughted he was
      pushed. He is the gentleman who came here just now with the old lord, and
      went out afterward (as is thoughted) with a stranger who had come a little
      earlier. Anyhow, that's as I had it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura entered the house, and acknowledging without the least reserve that
      she was the injured man's wife, had soon installed herself as head nurse
      by the bed on which he lay. When the two surgeons who had been sent for
      arrived, she learned from them that his wounds were so severe as to leave
      but a slender hope of recovery, it being little short of miraculous that
      he was not killed on the spot, which his enemy had evidently reckoned to
      be the case. She knew who that enemy was, and shuddered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura watched all night, but her husband knew nothing of her presence.
      During the next day he slightly recognized her, and in the evening was
      able to speak. He informed the surgeons that, as was surmised, he had been
      pushed over the cascade by Signor Smithozzi; but he communicated nothing
      to her who nursed him, not even replying to her remarks; he nodded
      courteously at any act of attention she rendered, and that was all.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a day or two it was declared that everything favoured his recovery,
      notwithstanding the severity of his injuries. Full search was made for
      Smithozzi, but as yet there was no intelligence of his whereabouts, though
      the repentant Laura communicated all she knew. As far as could be judged,
      he had come back to the carriage after searching out the way, and finding
      the young lady missing, had looked about for her till he was tired; then
      had driven on to Cliff-Martin, sold the horse and carriage next morning,
      and disappeared, probably by one of the departing coaches which ran thence
      to the nearest station, the only difference from his original programme
      being that he had gone alone.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      During the days and weeks of that long and tedious recovery, Laura watched
      by her husband's bedside with a zeal and assiduity which would have
      considerably extenuated any fault save one of such magnitude as hers. That
      her husband did not forgive her was soon obvious. Nothing that she could
      do in the way of smoothing pillows, easing his position, shifting
      bandages, or administering draughts, could win from him more than a few
      measured words of thankfulness, such as he would probably have uttered to
      any other woman on earth who had performed these particular services for
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dear, dear James,' she said one day, bending her face upon the bed in an
      excess of emotion. 'How you have suffered! It has been too cruel. I am
      more glad you are getting better than I can say. I have prayed for it-and
      I am sorry for what I have done; I am innocent of the worst, and-I hope
      you will not think me so very bad, James!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh no. On the contrary, I shall think you very good-as a nurse,' he
      answered, the caustic severity of his tone being apparent through its
      weakness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura let fall two or three silent tears, and said no more that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somehow or other Signor Smithozzi seemed to be making good his escape. It
      transpired that he had not taken a passage in either of the suspected
      coaches, though he had certainly got out of the county; altogether, the
      chance of finding him was problematical.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only did Captain Northbrook survive his injuries, but it soon appeared
      that in the course of a few weeks he would find himself little if any the
      worse for the catastrophe. It could also be seen that Laura, while
      secretly hoping for her husband's forgiveness for a piece of folly of
      which she saw the enormity more clearly every day, was in great doubt as
      to what her future relations with him would be. Moreover, to add to the
      complication, whilst she, as a runaway wife, was unforgiven by her
      husband, she and her husband, as a runaway couple, were unforgiven by her
      father, who had never once communicated with either of them since his
      departure from the inn. But her immediate anxiety was to win the pardon of
      her husband, who possibly might be bearing in mind, as he lay upon his
      couch, the familiar words of Brabantio, 'She has deceived her father, and
      may thee.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Matters went on thus till Captain Northbrook was able to walk about. He
      then removed with his wife to quiet apartments on the south coast, and
      here his recovery was rapid. Walking up the cliffs one day, supporting him
      by her arm as usual, she said to him, simply, 'James, if I go on as I am
      going now, and always attend to your smallest want, and never think of
      anything but devotion to you, will you-try to like me a little?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is a thing I must carefully consider,' he said, with the same gloomy
      dryness which characterized all his words to her now. 'When I have
      considered, I will tell you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not tell her that evening, though she lingered long at her routine
      work of making his bedroom comfortable, putting the light so that it would
      not shine into his eyes, seeing him fall asleep, and then retiring
      noiselessly to her own chamber. When they met in the morning at breakfast,
      and she had asked him as usual how he had passed the night, she added
      timidly, in the silence which followed his reply, 'Have you considered?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, I have not considered sufficiently to give you an answer.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura sighed, but to no purpose; and the day wore on with intense
      heaviness to her, and the customary modicum of strength gained to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning she put the same question, and looked up despairingly in
      his face, as though her whole life hung upon his reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, I have considered,' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'We must part.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O James!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I cannot forgive you; no man would. Enough is settled upon you to keep
      you in comfort, whatever your father may do. I shall sell out, and
      disappear from this hemisphere.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You have absolutely decided?' she asked miserably. 'I have nobody now to
      c-c-care for-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have absolutely decided,' he shortly returned. 'We had better part
      here. You will go back to your father. There is no reason why I should
      accompany you, since my presence would only stand in the way of the
      forgiveness he will probably grant you if you appear before him alone. We
      will say farewell to each other in three days from this time. I have
      calculated on being ready to go on that day.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Bowed down with trouble, she withdrew to her room, and the three days were
      passed by her husband in writing letters and attending to other
      business-matters, saying hardly a word to her the while. The morning of
      departure came; but before the horses had been put in to take the severed
      twain in different directions, out of sight of each other, possibly for
      ever, the postman arrived with the morning letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was one for the captain; none for her-there were never any for her.
      However, on this occasion something was enclosed for her in his, which he
      handed her. She read it and looked up helpless.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My dear father-is dead!' she said. In a few moments she added, in a
      whisper, 'I must go to the Manor to bury him . . . Will you go with me,
      James?'
    </p>
    <p>
      He musingly looked out of the window. 'I suppose it is an awkward and
      melancholy undertaking for a woman alone,' he said coldly. 'Well, well-my
      poor uncle!-Yes, I'll go with you, and see you through the business.'
    </p>
    <p>
      So they went off together instead of asunder, as planned. It is
      unnecessary to record the details of the journey, or of the sad week which
      followed it at her father's house. Lord Quantock's seat was a fine old
      mansion standing in its own park, and there were plenty of opportunities
      for husband and wife either to avoid each other, or to get reconciled if
      they were so minded, which one of them was at least. Captain Northbrook
      was not present at the reading of the will. She came to him afterward, and
      found him packing up his papers, intending to start next morning, now that
      he had seen her through the turmoil occasioned by her father's death.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He has left me everything that he could!' she said to her husband.
      'James, will you forgive me now, and stay?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I cannot stay.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why not?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I cannot stay,' he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But why?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't like you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He acted up to his word. When she came downstairs the next morning she was
      told that he had gone.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Laura bore her double bereavement as best she could. The vast mansion in
      which she had hitherto lived, with all its historic contents, had gone to
      her father's successor in the title; but her own was no unhandsome one.
      Around lay the undulating park, studded with trees a dozen times her own
      age; beyond it, the wood; beyond the wood, the farms. All this fair and
      quiet scene was hers. She nevertheless remained a lonely, repentant,
      depressed being, who would have given the greater part of everything she
      possessed to ensure the presence and affection of that husband whose very
      austerity and phlegm-qualities that had formerly led to the alienation
      between them-seemed now to be adorable features in his character.
    </p>
    <p>
      She hoped and hoped again, but all to no purpose. Captain Northbrook did
      not alter his mind and return. He was quite a different sort of man from
      one who altered his mind; that she was at last despairingly forced to
      admit. And then she left off hoping, and settled down to a mechanical
      routine of existence which in some measure dulled her grief; but at the
      expense of all her natural animation and the sprightly wilfulness which
      had once charmed those who knew her, though it was perhaps all the while a
      factor in the production of her unhappiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      To say that her beauty quite departed as the years rolled on would be to
      overstate the truth. Time is not a merciful master, as we all know, and he
      was not likely to act exceptionally in the case of a woman who had mental
      troubles to bear in addition to the ordinary weight of years. Be this as
      it may, eleven other winters came and went, and Laura Northbrook remained
      the lonely mistress of house and lands without once hearing of her
      husband. Every probability seemed to favour the assumption that he had
      died in some foreign land; and offers for her hand were not few as the
      probability verged on certainty with the long lapse of time. But the idea
      of remarriage seemed never to have entered her head for a moment. Whether
      she continued to hope even now for his return could not be distinctly
      ascertained; at all events she lived a life unmodified in the slightest
      degree from that of the first six months of his absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      This twelfth year of Laura's loneliness, and the thirtieth of her life
      drew on apace, and the season approached that had seen the unhappy
      adventure for which she so long had suffered. Christmas promised to be
      rather wet than cold, and the trees on the outskirts of Laura's estate
      dripped monotonously from day to day upon the turnpike-road which bordered
      them. On an afternoon in this week between three and four o'clock a hired
      fly might have been seen driving along the highway at this point, and on
      reaching the top of the hill it stopped. A gentleman of middle age
      alighted from the vehicle.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You need drive no farther,' he said to the coachman. 'The rain seems to
      have nearly ceased. I'll stroll a little way, and return on foot to the
      inn by dinner-time.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The flyman touched his hat, turned the horse, and drove back as directed.
      When he was out of sight, the gentleman walked on, but he had not gone far
      before the rain again came down pitilessly, though of this the pedestrian
      took little heed, going leisurely onward till he reached Laura's park
      gate, which he passed through. The clouds were thick and the days were
      short, so that by the time he stood in front of the mansion it was dark.
      In addition to this his appearance, which on alighting from the carriage
      had been untarnished, partook now of the character of a drenched wayfarer
      not too well blessed with this world's goods. He halted for no more than a
      moment at the front entrance, and going round to the servants' quarter, as
      if he had a preconceived purpose in so doing, there rang the bell. When a
      page came to him he inquired if they would kindly allow him to dry himself
      by the kitchen fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The page retired, and after a murmured colloquy returned with the cook,
      who informed the wet and muddy man that though it was not her custom to
      admit strangers, she should have no particular objection to his drying
      himself; the night being so damp and gloomy. Therefore the wayfarer
      entered and sat down by the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The owner of this house is a very rich gentleman, no doubt?' he asked, as
      he watched the meat turning on the spit.
    </p>
    <p>
      ''Tis not a gentleman, but a lady,' said the cook.
    </p>
    <p>
      'A widow, I presume?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A sort of widow. Poor soul, her husband is gone abroad, and has never
      been heard of for many years.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She sees plenty of company, no doubt, to make up for his absence?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, indeed-hardly a soul. Service here is as bad as being in a nunnery.'
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, the wayfarer, who had at first been so coldly received,
      contrived by his frank and engaging manner to draw the ladies of the
      kitchen into a most confidential conversation, in which Laura's history
      was minutely detailed, from the day of her husband's departure to the
      present. The salient feature in all their discourse was her unflagging
      devotion to his memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having apparently learned all that he wanted to know-among other things
      that she was at this moment, as always, alone-the traveller said he was
      quite dry; and thanking the servants for their kindness, departed as he
      had come. On emerging into the darkness he did not, however, go down the
      avenue by which he had arrived. He simply walked round to the front door.
      There he rang, and the door was opened to him by a man-servant whom he had
      not seen during his sojourn at the other end of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      In answer to the servant's inquiry for his name, he said ceremoniously,
      'Will you tell The Honourable Mrs. Northbrook that the man she nursed many
      years ago, after a frightful accident, has called to thank her?'
    </p>
    <p>
      The footman retreated, and it was rather a long time before any further
      signs of attention were apparent. Then he was shown into the drawing-
      room, and the door closed behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the couch was Laura, trembling and pale. She parted her lips and held
      out her hands to him, but could not speak. But he did not require speech,
      and in a moment they were in each other's arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strange news circulated through that mansion and the neighbouring town on
      the next and following days. But the world has a way of getting used to
      things, and the intelligence of the return of The Honourable Mrs.
      Northbrook's long-absent husband was soon received with comparative calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days more brought Christmas, and the forlorn home of Laura
      Northbrook blazed from basement to attic with light and cheerfulness. Not
      that the house was overcrowded with visitors, but many were present, and
      the apathy of a dozen years came at length to an end. The animation which
      set in thus at the close of the old year did not diminish on the arrival
      of the new; and by the time its twelve months had likewise run the course
      of its predecessors, a son had been added to the dwindled line of the
      Northbrook family.

      At the conclusion of this narrative the Spark was thanked, with a manner
      of some surprise, for nobody had credited him with a taste for tale-
      telling. Though it had been resolved that this story should be the last, a
      few of the weather-bound listeners were for sitting on into the small
      hours over their pipes and glasses, and raking up yet more episodes of
      family history. But the majority murmured reasons for soon getting to
      their lodgings.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was quite dark without, except in the immediate neighbourhood of the
      feeble street-lamps, and before a few shop-windows which had been hardily
      kept open in spite of the obvious unlikelihood of any chance customer
      traversing the muddy thoroughfares at that hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      By one, by two, and by three the benighted members of the Field-Club rose
      from their seats, shook hands, made appointments, and dropped away to
      their respective quarters, free or hired, hoping for a fair morrow. It
      would probably be not until the next summer meeting, months away in the
      future, that the easy intercourse which now existed between them all would
      repeat itself. The crimson maltster, for instance, knew that on the
      following market-day his friends the President, the Rural Dean, and the
      bookworm would pass him in the street, if they met him, with the barest
      nod of civility, the President and the Colonel for social reasons, the
      bookworm for intellectual reasons, and the Rural Dean for moral ones, the
      latter being a staunch teetotaller, dead against John Barleycorn. The
      sentimental member knew that when, on his rambles, he met his friend the
      bookworm with a pocket-copy of something or other under his nose, the
      latter would not love his companionship as he had done to-day; and the
      President, the aristocrat, and the farmer knew that affairs political,
      sporting, domestic, or agricultural would exclude for a long time all
      rumination on the characters of dames gone to dust for scores of years,
      however beautiful and noble they may have been in their day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last member at length departed, the attendant at the museum lowered
      the fire, the curator locked up the rooms, and soon there was only a
      single pirouetting flame on the top of a single coal to make the bones of
      the ichthyosaurus seem to leap, the stuffed birds to wink, and to draw a
      smile from the varnished skulls of Vespasian's soldiery. draw a smile from
      the varnished skulls of Vespasian's soldiery.

    <h2>
      PREFACE
    </h2>
    <p>
      An apology is perhaps needed for the neglect of contrast which is shown by
      presenting two consecutive stories of hangmen in such a small collection
      as the following. But in the neighbourhood of county-towns tales of
      executions used to form a large proportion of the local traditions; and
      though never personally acquainted with any chief operator at such scenes,
      the writer of these pages had as a boy the privilege of being on speaking
      terms with a man who applied for the office, and who sank into an
      incurable melancholy because he failed to get it, some slight mitigation
      of his grief being to dwell upon striking episodes in the lives of those
      happier ones who had held it with success and renown. His tale of
      disappointment used to cause some wonder why his ambition should have
      taken such an unfortunate form, but its nobleness was never questioned. In
      those days, too, there was still living an old woman who, for the cure of
      some eating disease, had been taken in her youth to have her 'blood
      turned' by a convict's corpse, in the manner described in 'The Withered
      Arm.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Since writing this story some years ago I have been reminded by an aged
      friend who knew 'Rhoda Brook' that, in relating her dream, my
      forgetfulness has weakened the facts our of which the tale grew. In
      reality it was while lying down on a hot afternoon that the incubus
      oppressed her and she flung it off, with the results upon the body of the
      original as described. To my mind the occurrence of such a vision in the
      daytime is more impressive than if it had happened in a midnight dream.
      Readers are therefore asked to correct the misrelation, which affords an
      instance of how our imperfect memories insensibly formalize the fresh
      originality of living fact-from whose shape they slowly depart, as
      machine-made castings depart by degrees from the sharp hand- work of the
      mould.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the many devices for concealing smuggled goods in caves and pits of
      the earth, that of planting an apple-tree in a tray or box which was
      placed over the mouth of the pit is, I believe, unique, and it is detailed
      in one of the tales precisely as described by an old carrier of 'tubs'-a
      man who was afterwards in my father's employ for over thirty years. I
      never gathered from his reminiscences what means were adopted for lifting
      the tree, which, with its roots, earth, and receptacle, must have been of
      considerable weight. There is no doubt, however, that the thing was done
      through many years. My informant often spoke, too, of the horribly
      suffocating sensation produced by the pair of spirit-tubs slung upon the
      chest and back, after stumbling with the burden of them for several miles
      inland over a rough country and in darkness. He said that though years of
      his youth and young manhood were spent in this irregular business, his
      profits from the same, taken all together, did not average the wages he
      might have earned in a steady employment, whilst the fatigues and risks
      were excessive.
    </p>
    <p>
      I may add that the first story in the series turns upon a physical
      possibility that may attach to women of imaginative temperament, and that
      is well supported by the experiences of medical men and other observers of
      such manifestations.

    <h2>
      AN IMAGINATIVE WOMAN
    </h2>
    <p>
      When William Marchmill had finished his inquiries for lodgings at a
      well-known watering-place in Upper Wessex, he returned to the hotel to
      find his wife. She, with the children, had rambled along the shore, and
      Marchmill followed in the direction indicated by the military-looking
      hall-porter
    </p>
    <p>
      'By Jove, how far you've gone! I am quite out of breath,' Marchmill said,
      rather impatiently, when he came up with his wife, who was reading as she
      walked, the three children being considerably further ahead with the
      nurse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Marchmill started out of the reverie into which the book had thrown
      her. 'Yes,' she said, 'you've been such a long time. I was tired of
      staying in that dreary hotel. But I am sorry if you have wanted me, Will?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I have had trouble to suit myself. When you see the airy and
      comfortable rooms heard of, you find they are stuffy and uncomfortable.
      Will you come and see if what I've fixed on will do? There is not much
      room, I am afraid; hut I can light on nothing better. The town is rather
      full.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The pair left the children and nurse to continue their ramble, and went
      back together.
    </p>
    <p>
      In age well-balanced, in personal appearance fairly matched, and in
      domestic requirements conformable, in temper this couple differed, though
      even here they did not often clash, he being equable, if not lymphatic,
      and she decidedly nervous and sanguine. It was to their tastes and
      fancies, those smallest, greatest particulars, that no common denominator
      could be applied. Marchmill considered his wife's likes and inclinations
      somewhat silly; she considered his sordid and material. The husband's
      business was that of a gunmaker in a thriving city northwards, and his
      soul was in that business always; the lady was best characterized by that
      superannuated phrase of elegance 'a votary of the muse.' An
      impressionable, palpitating creature was Ella, shrinking humanely from
      detailed knowledge of her husband's trade whenever she reflected that
      everything he manufactured had for its purpose the destruction of life.
      She could only recover her equanimity by assuring herself that some, at
      least, of his weapons were sooner or later used for the extermination of
      horrid vermin and animals almost as cruel to their inferiors in species as
      human beings were to theirs.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had never antecedently regarded this occupation of his as any
      objection to having him for a husband. Indeed, the necessity of getting
      life-leased at all cost, a cardinal virtue which all good mothers teach,
      kept her from thinking of it at all till she had closed with William, had
      passed the honeymoon, and reached the reflecting stage. Then, like a
      person who has stumbled upon some object in the dark, she wondered what
      she had got; mentally walked round it, estimated it; whether it were rare
      or common; contained gold, silver, or lead; were a clog or a pedestal,
      everything to her or nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came to some vague conclusions, and since then had kept her heart
      alive by pitying her proprietor's obtuseness and want of refinement,
      pitying herself, and letting off her delicate and ethereal emotions in
      imaginative occupations, day-dreams, and night-sighs, which perhaps would
      not much have disturbed William if he had known of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her figure was small, elegant, and slight in build, tripping, or rather
      bounding, in movement. She was dark-eyed, and had that marvellously bright
      and liquid sparkle in each pupil which characterizes persons of Ella's
      cast of soul, and is too often a cause of heartache to the possessor's
      male friends, ultimately sometimes to herself. Her husband was a tall,
      long-featured man, with a brown beard; he had a pondering regard; and was,
      it must be added, usually kind and tolerant to her. He spoke in squarely
      shaped sentences, and was supremely satisfied with a condition of
      sublunary things which made weapons a necessity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Husband and wife walked till they had reached the house they were in
      search of, which stood in a terrace facing the sea, and was fronted by a
      small garden of wind-proof and salt-proof evergreens, stone steps leading
      up to the porch. It had its number in the row, but, being rather larger
      than the rest, was in addition sedulously distinguished as Coburg House by
      its landlady, though everybody else called it 'Thirteen, New Parade.' The
      spot was bright and lively now; but in winter it became necessary to place
      sandbags against the door, and to stuff up the keyhole against the wind
      and rain, which had worn the paint so thin that the priming and knotting
      showed through.
    </p>
    <p>
      The householder, who bad been watching for the gentleman's return, met
      them in the passage, and showed the rooms. She informed them that she was
      a professional man's widow, left in needy circumstances by the rather
      sudden death of her husband, and she spoke anxiously of the conveniences
      of the establishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Marchmill said that she liked the situation and the house; but, it
      being small, there would not be accommodation enough, unless she could
      have all the rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlady mused with an air of disappointment. She wanted the visitors
      to be her tenants very badly, she said, with obvious honesty. But
      unfortunately two of the rooms were occupied permanently by a bachelor
      gentleman. He did not pay season prices, it was true; but as he kept on
      his apartments all the year round, and was an extremely nice and
      interesting young man, who gave no trouble, she did not like to turn him
      out for a month's 'let,' even at a high figure. 'Perhaps, however,' she
      added, 'he might offer to go for a time.'
    </p>
    <p>
      They would not hear of this, and went back to the hotel, intending to
      proceed to the agent's to inquire further. Hardly had they sat down to tea
      when the landlady called. Her gentleman, she said, had been so obliging as
      to offer to give up his rooms for three or four weeks rather than drive
      the new-comers away.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is very kind, but we won't inconvenience him in that way,' said the
      Marchmills.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, it won't inconvenience him, I assure you!' said the landlady
      eloquently. 'You see, he's a different sort of young man from most-dreamy,
      solitary, rather melancholy-and he cares more to be here when the
      south-westerly gales are beating against the door, and the sea washes over
      the Parade, and there's not a soul in the place, than he does now in the
      season. He'd just as soon be where, in fact, he's going temporarily, to a
      little cottage on the Island opposite, for a change.' She hoped therefore
      that they would come.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Marchmill family accordingly took possession of the house next day,
      and it seemed to suit them very well. After luncheon Mr. Marchmill
      strolled out towards the pier, and Mrs. Marchmill, having despatched the
      children to their outdoor amusements on the sands, settled herself in more
      completely, examining this and that article, and testing the reflecting
      powers of the mirror in the wardrobe door.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the small back sitting-room, which had been the young bachelor's, she
      found furniture of a more personal nature than in the rest. Shabby books,
      of correct rather than rare editions, were piled up in a queerly reserved
      manner in corners, as if the previous occupant had not conceived the
      possibility that any incoming person of the season's bringing could care
      to look inside them. The landlady hovered on the threshold to rectify
      anything that Mrs. Marchmill might not find to her satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll make this my own little room,' said the latter, 'because the books
      are here. By the way, the person who has left seems to have a good many.
      He won't mind my reading some of them, Mrs. Hooper, I hope?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O dear no, ma'am. Yes, he has a good many. You see, he is in the literary
      line himself somewhat. He is a poet-yes, really a poet-and he has a little
      income of his own, which is enough to write verses on, but not enough for
      cutting a figure, even if he cared to.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A poet! O, I did not know that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Marchmill opened one of the books, and saw the owner's name written
      on the title-page. 'Dear me!' she continued; 'I know his name very
      well-Robert Trewe-of course I do; and his writings! And it is his rooms we
      have taken, and him we have turned out of his home?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Ella Marchmill, sitting down alone a few minutes later, thought with
      interested surprise of Robert Trewe. Her own latter history will best
      explain that interest. Herself the only daughter of a struggling man of
      letters, she had during the last year or two taken to writing poems, in an
      endeavour to find a congenial channel in which to let flow her painfully
      embayed emotions, whose former limpidity and sparkle seemed departing in
      the stagnation caused by the routine of a practical household and the
      gloom of bearing children to a commonplace father. These poems, subscribed
      with a masculine pseudonym, had appeared in various obscure magazines, and
      in two cases in rather prominent ones. In the second of the latter the
      page which bore her effusion at the bottom, in smallish print, bore at the
      top, in large print, a few verses on the same subject by this very man,
      Robert Trewe. Both of them had, in fact, been struck by a tragic incident
      reported in the daily papers, and had used it simultaneously as an
      inspiration, the editor remarking in a note upon the coincidence, and that
      the excellence of both poems prompted him to give them together.
    </p>

      After that event Ella, otherwise 'John Ivy,' had watched with much
      attention the appearance anywhere in print of verse bearing the signature
      of Robert Trewe, who, with a man's unsusceptibility on the question of
      sex, had never once thought of passing himself off as a woman. To be sure,
      Mrs. Marchmill had satisfied herself with a sort of reason for doing the
      contrary in her case; that nobody might believe in her inspiration if they
      found that the sentiments came from a pushing tradesman's wife, from the
      mother of three children by a matter-of-fact small-arms manufacturer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trewe's verse contrasted with that of the rank and file of recent minor
      poets in being impassioned rather than ingenious, luxuriant rather than
      finished. Neither symboliste nor decadent, he was a pessimist in so far as
      that character applies to a man who looks at the worst contingencies as
      well as the best in the human condition. Being little attracted by
      excellences of form and rhythm apart from content, he sometimes, when
      feeling outran his artistic speed, perpetrated sonnets in the loosely
      rhymed Elizabethan fashion, which every right-minded reviewer said he
      ought not to have done.
    </p>
    <p>
      With sad and hopeless envy, Ella Marchmill had often and often scanned the
      rival poet's work, so much stronger as it always was than her own feeble
      lines. She had imitated him, and her inability to touch his level would
      send her into fits of despondency. Months passed away thus, till she
      observed from the publishers' list that Trewe had collected his fugitive
      pieces into a volume, which was duly issued, and was much or little
      praised according to chance, and had a sale quite sufficient to pay for
      the printing.
    </p>
    <p>
      This step onward had suggested to John Ivy the idea of collecting her
      pieces also, or at any rate of making up a book of her rhymes by adding
      many in manuscript to the few that had seen the light, for she had been
      able to get no great number into print. A ruinous charge was made for
      costs of publication; a few reviews noticed her poor little volume; but
      nobody talked of it, nobody bought it, and it fell dead in a fortnight-if
      it had ever been alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      The author's thoughts were diverted to another groove just then by the
      discovery that she was going to have a third child, and the collapse of
      her poetical venture had perhaps less effect upon her mind than it might
      have done if she had been domestically unoccupied. Her husband had paid
      the publisher's bill with the doctor's, and there it all had ended for the
      time. But, though less than a poet of her century, Ella was more than a
      mere multiplier of her kind, and latterly she had begun to feel the old
      afflatus once more. And now by an odd conjunction she found herself in the
      rooms of Robert Trewe.
    </p>
    <p>
      She thoughtfully rose from her chair and searched the apartment with the
      interest of a fellow-tradesman. Yes, the volume of his own verse was among
      the rest. Though quite familiar with its contents, she read it here as if
      it spoke aloud to her, then called up Mrs. Hooper, the landlady, for some
      trivial service, and inquired again about the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I'm sure you'd be interested in him, ma'am, if you could see him,
      only he's so shy that I don't suppose you will.' Mrs. Hooper seemed
      nothing loth to minister to her tenant's curiosity about her predecessor.
      'Lived here long? Yes, nearly two years. He keeps on his rooms even when
      he's not here: the soft air of this place suits his chest, and he likes to
      be able to come back at any time. He is mostly writing or reading, and
      doesn't see many people, though, for the matter of that, he is such a
      good, kind young fellow that folks would only be too glad to be friendly
      with him if they knew him. You don't meet kind- hearted people every day.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, he's kind-hearted . . . and good.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes; he'll oblige me in anything if I ask him. "Mr. Trewe," I say to him
      sometimes, "you are rather out of spirits." "Well, I am, Mrs. Hooper,"
      he'll say, "though I don't know how you should find it out." "Why not take
      a little change?" I ask. Then in a day or two he'll say that he will take
      a trip to Paris, or Norway, or somewhere; and I assure you he comes back
      all the better for it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, indeed! His is a sensitive nature, no doubt.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. Still he's odd in some things. Once when he had finished a poem of
      his composition late at night he walked up and down the room rehearsing
      it; and the floors being so thin-jerry-built houses, you know, though I
      say it myself-he kept me awake up above him till I wished him further . .
      . But we get on very well.'
    </p>
    <p>
      This was but the beginning of a series of conversations about the rising
      poet as the days went on. On one of these occasions Mrs. Hooper drew
      Ella's attention to what she had not noticed before: minute scribblings in
      pencil on the wall-paper behind the curtains at the head of the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O! let me look,' said Mrs. Marchmill, unable to conceal a rush of tender
      curiosity as she bent her pretty face close to the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      'These,' said Mrs. Hooper, with the manner of a woman who knew things,
      'are the very beginnings and first thoughts of his verses. He has tried to
      rub most of them out, but you can read them still. My belief is that he
      wakes up in the night, you know, with some rhyme in his head, and jots it
      down there on the wall lest he should forget it by the morning. Some of
      these very lines you see here I have seen afterwards in print in the
      magazines. Some are newer; indeed, I have not seen that one before. It
      must have been done only a few days ago.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O yes! . . . '
    </p>
    <p>
      Ella Marchmill flushed without knowing why, and suddenly wished her
      companion would go away, now that the information was imparted. An
      indescribable consciousness of personal interest rather than literary made
      her anxious to read the inscription alone; and she accordingly waited till
      she could do so, with a sense that a great store of emotion would be
      enjoyed in the act.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps because the sea was choppy outside the Island, Ella's husband
      found it much pleasanter to go sailing and steaming about without his
      wife, who was a bad sailor, than with her. He did not disdain to go thus
      alone on board the steamboats of the cheap-trippers, where there was
      dancing by moonlight, and where the couples would come suddenly down with
      a lurch into each other's arms; for, as he blandly told her, the company
      was too mixed for him to take her amid such scenes. Thus, while this
      thriving manufacturer got a great deal of change and sea-air out of his
      sojourn here, the life, external at least, of Ella was monotonous enough,
      and mainly consisted in passing a certain number of hours each day in
      bathing and walking up and down a stretch of shore. But the poetic impulse
      having again waxed strong, she was possessed by an inner flame which left
      her hardly conscious of what was proceeding around her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had read till she knew by heart Trewe's last little volume of verses,
      and spent a great deal of time in vainly attempting to rival some of them,
      till, in her failure, she burst into tears. The personal element in the
      magnetic attraction exercised by this circumambient, unapproachable master
      of hers was so much stronger than the intellectual and abstract that she
      could not understand it. To be sure, she was surrounded noon and night by
      his customary environment, which literally whispered of him to her at
      every moment; but he was a man she had never seen, and that all that moved
      her was the instinct to specialize a waiting emotion on the first fit
      thing that came to hand did not, of course, suggest itself to Ella.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the natural way of passion under the too practical conditions which
      civilization has devised for its fruition, her husband's love for her had
      not survived, except in the form of fitful friendship, any more than, or
      even so much as, her own for him; and, being a woman of very living
      ardours, that required sustenance of some sort, they were beginning to
      feed on this chancing material, which was, indeed, of a quality far better
      than chance usually offers.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day the children had been playing hide-and-seek in a closet, whence,
      in their excitement, they pulled out some clothing. Mrs. Hooper explained
      that it belonged to Mr. Trewe, and hung it up in the closet again.
      Possessed of her fantasy, Ella went later in the afternoon, when nobody
      was in that part of the house, opened the closet, unhitched one of the
      articles, a mackintosh, and put it on, with the waterproof cap belonging
      to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The mantle of Elijah!' she said. 'Would it might inspire me to rival him,
      glorious genius that he is!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes always grew wet when she thought like that, and she turned to
      look at herself in the glass. His heart had beat inside that coat, and his
      brain had worked under that hat at levels of thought she would never
      reach. The consciousness of her weakness beside him made her feel quite
      sick. Before she had got the things off her the door opened, and her
      husband entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What the devil-'
    </p>
    <p>
      She blushed, and removed them
    </p>
    <p>
      'I found them in the closet here,' she said, 'and put them on in a freak.
      What have I else to do? You are always away!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Always away? Well . . . '
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening she had a further talk with the landlady, who might herself
      have nourished a half-tender regard for the poet, so ready was she to
      discourse ardently about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are interested in Mr. Trewe, I know, ma'am,' she said; 'and he has
      just sent to say that he is going to call to-morrow afternoon to look up
      some books of his that he wants, if I'll be in, and he may select them
      from your room?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O yes!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You could very well meet Mr Trewe then, if you'd like to be in the way!'
    </p>
    <p>
      She promised with secret delight, and went to bed musing of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning her husband observed: 'I've been thinking of what you said,
      Ell: that I have gone about a good deal and left you without much to amuse
      you. Perhaps it's true. To-day, as there's not much sea, I'll take you
      with me on board the yacht.'
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first time in her experience of such an offer Ella was not glad.
      But she accepted it for the moment. The time for setting out drew near,
      and she went to get ready. She stood reflecting. The longing to see the
      poet she was now distinctly in love with overpowered all other
      considerations.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't want to go,' she said to herself. 'I can't bear to be away! And I
      won't go.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She told her husband that she had changed her mind about wishing to sail.
      He was indifferent, and went his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the rest of the day the house was quiet, the children having gone out
      upon the sands. The blinds waved in the sunshine to the soft, steady
      stroke of the sea beyond the wall; and the notes of the Green Silesian
      band, a troop of foreign gentlemen hired for the season, had drawn almost
      all the residents and promenaders away from the vicinity of Coburg House.
      A knock was audible at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Marchmill did not hear any servant go to answer it, and she became
      impatient. The books were in the room where she sat; but nobody came up.
      She rang the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      'There is some person waiting at the door,' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no, ma'am! He's gone long ago. I answered it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hooper came in herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      'So disappointing!' she said. 'Mr. Trewe not coming after all!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But I heard him knock, I fancy!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No; that was somebody inquiring for lodgings who came to the wrong house.
      I forgot to tell you that Mr. Trewe sent a note just before lunch to say I
      needn't get any tea for him, as he should not require the books, and
      wouldn't come to select them.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Ella was miserable, and for a long time could not even re-read his
      mournful ballad on 'Severed Lives,' so aching was her erratic little
      heart, and so tearful her eyes. When the children came in with wet
      stockings, and ran up to her to tell her of their adventures, she could
      not feel that she cared about them half as much as usual.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      'Mrs. Hooper, have you a photograph of-the gentleman who lived here?' She
      was getting to be curiously shy in mentioning his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, yes. It's in the ornamental frame on the mantelpiece in your own
      bedroom, ma'am.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No; the Royal Duke and Duchess are in that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, so they are; but he's behind them. He belongs rightly to that frame,
      which I bought on purpose; but as he went away he said: "Cover me up from
      those strangers that are coming, for God's sake. I don't want them staring
      at me, and I am sure they won't want me staring at them." So I slipped in
      the Duke and Duchess temporarily in front of him, as they had no frame,
      and Royalties are more suitable for letting furnished than a private young
      man. If you take 'em out you'll see him under. Lord, ma'am, he wouldn't
      mind if he knew it! He didn't think the next tenant would be such an
      attractive lady as you, or he wouldn't have thought of hiding himself;
      perhaps.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is he handsome?' she asked timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I call him so. Some, perhaps, wouldn't.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Should I?' she asked, with eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I think you would, though some would say he's more striking than
      handsome; a large-eyed thoughtful fellow, you know, with a very electric
      flash in his eye when he looks round quickly, such as you'd expect a poet
      to be who doesn't get his living by it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How old is he?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Several years older than yourself, ma'am; about thirty-one or two, I
      think.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Ella was, as a matter of fact, a few months over thirty herself; but she
      did not look nearly so much. Though so immature in nature, she was
      entering on that tract of life in which emotional women begin to suspect
      that last love may be stronger than first love; and she would soon, alas,
      enter on the still more melancholy tract when at least the vainer ones of
      her sex shrink from receiving a male visitor otherwise than with their
      backs to the window or the blinds half down. She reflected on Mrs.
      Hooper's remark, and said no more about age.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then a telegram was brought up. It came from her husband, who had
      gone down the Channel as far as Budmouth with his friends in the yacht,
      and would not be able to get back till next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      After her light dinner Ella idled about the shore with the children till
      dusk, thinking of the yet uncovered photograph in her room, with a serene
      sense of something ecstatic to come. For, with the subtle luxuriousness of
      fancy in which this young woman was an adept, on learning that her husband
      was to be absent that night she had refrained from incontinently rushing
      upstairs and opening the picture-frame, preferring to reserve the
      inspection till she could be alone, and a more romantic tinge be imparted
      to the occasion by silence, candles, solemn sea and stars outside, than
      was afforded by the garish afternoon sunlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The children had been sent to bed, and Ella soon followed, though it was
      not yet ten o'clock. To gratify her passionate curiosity she now made her
      preparations, first getting rid of superfluous garments and putting on her
      dressing-gown, then arranging a chair in front of the table and reading
      several pages of Trewe's tenderest utterances. Then she fetched the
      portrait-frame to the light, opened the back, took out the likeness, and
      set it up before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a striking countenance to look upon. The poet wore a luxuriant
      black moustache and imperial, and a slouched hat which shaded the
      forehead. The large dark eyes, described by the landlady, showed an
      unlimited capacity for misery; they looked out from beneath well-shaped
      brows as if they were reading the universe in the microcosm of the
      confronter's face, and were not altogether overjoyed at what the spectacle
      portended.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ella murmured in her lowest, richest, tenderest tone: 'And it's you who've
      so cruelly eclipsed me these many times!'
    </p>
    <p>
      As she gazed long at the portrait she fell into thought, till her eyes
      filled with tears, and she touched the cardboard with her lips. Then she
      laughed with a nervous lightness, and wiped her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      She thought how wicked she was, a woman having a husband and three
      children, to let her mind stray to a stranger in this unconscionable
      manner. No, he was not a stranger! She knew his thoughts and feelings as
      well as she knew her own; they were, in fact, the self-same thoughts and
      feelings as hers, which her husband distinctly lacked; perhaps luckily for
      himself; considering that he had to provide for family expenses.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He's nearer my real self, he's more intimate with the real me than Will
      is, after all, even though I've never seen him,' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laid his book and picture on the table at the bedside, and when she
      was reclining on the pillow she re-read those of Robert Trewe's verses
      which she had marked from time to time as most touching and true. Putting
      these aside, she set up the photograph on its edge upon the coverlet, and
      contemplated it as she lay. Then she scanned again by the light of the
      candle the half-obliterated pencillings on the wall-paper beside her head.
      There they were-phrases, couplets, bouts-rimes, beginnings and middles of
      lines, ideas in the rough, like Shelley's scraps, and the least of them so
      intense, so sweet, so palpitating, that it seemed as if his very breath,
      warm and loving, fanned her cheeks from those walls, walls that had
      surrounded his head times and times as they surrounded her own now. He
      must often have put up his hand so-with the pencil in it. Yes, the writing
      was sideways, as it would be if executed by one who extended his arm thus.
    </p>
    <p>
      These inscribed shapes of the poet's world,
    </p>
    <p>
      'Forms more real than living man, Nurslings of immortality,'
    </p>
    <p>
      were, no doubt, the thoughts and spirit-strivings which had come to him in
      the dead of night, when he could let himself go and have no fear of the
      frost of criticism. No doubt they had often been written up hastily by the
      light of the moon, the rays of the lamp, in the blue-grey dawn, in full
      daylight perhaps never. And now her hair was dragging where his arm had
      lain when he secured the fugitive fancies; she was sleeping on a poet's
      lips, immersed in the very essence of him, permeated by his spirit as by
      an ether.
    </p>
    <p>
      While she was dreaming the minutes away thus, a footstep came upon the
      stairs, and in a moment she heard her husband's heavy step on the landing
      immediately without.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ell, where are you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      What possessed her she could not have described, but, with an instinctive
      objection to let her husband know what she had been doing, she slipped the
      photograph under the pillow just as he flung open the door, with the air
      of a man who had dined not badly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, I beg pardon,' said William Marchmill. 'Have you a headache? I am
      afraid I have disturbed you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, I've not got a headache,' said she. 'How is it you've come?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, we found we could get back in very good time after all, and I
      didn't want to make another day of it, because of going somewhere else
      to-morrow.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Shall I come down again?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no. I'm as tired as a dog. I've had a good feed, and I shall turn in
      straight off. I want to get out at six o'clock to-morrow if I can . . . I
      shan't disturb you by my getting up; it will be long before you are
      awake.' And he came forward into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      While her eyes followed his movements, Ella softly pushed the photograph
      further out of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sure you're not ill?' he asked, bending over her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, only wicked!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never mind that.' And he stooped and kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning Marchmill was called at six o'clock; and in waking and
      yawning she heard him muttering to himself: 'What the deuce is this that's
      been crackling under me so?' Imagining her asleep he searched round him
      and withdrew something. Through her half-opened eyes she perceived it to
      be Mr. Trewe.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I'm damned!' her husband exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What, dear?' said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, you are awake? Ha! ha!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What do you mean?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Some bloke's photograph-a friend of our landlady's, I suppose. I wonder
      how it came here; whisked off the table by accident perhaps when they were
      making the bed.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I was looking at it yesterday, and it must have dropped in then.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, he's a friend of yours? Bless his picturesque heart!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Ella's loyalty to the object of her admiration could not endure to hear
      him ridiculed. 'He's a clever man!' she said, with a tremor in her gentle
      voice which she herself felt to be absurdly uncalled for.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He is a rising poet-the gentleman who occupied two of these rooms before
      we came, though I've never seen him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How do you know, if you've never seen him?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mrs. Hooper told me when she showed me the photograph.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O; well, I must up and be off. I shall be home rather early. Sorry I
      can't take you to-day, dear. Mind the children don't go getting drowned.'
    </p>
    <p>
      That day Mrs. Marchmill inquired if Mr. Trewe were likely to call at any
      other time.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' said Mrs. Hooper. 'He's coming this day week to stay with a friend
      near here till you leave. He'll be sure to call.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Marchmill did return quite early in the afternoon; and, opening some
      letters which had arrived in his absence, declared suddenly that he and
      his family would have to leave a week earlier than they had expected to
      do-in short, in three days.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Surely we can stay a week longer?' she pleaded. 'I like it here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't. It is getting rather slow.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then you might leave me and the children!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How perverse you are, Ell! What's the use? And have to come to fetch you!
      No: we'll all return together; and we'll make out our time in North Wales
      or Brighton a little later on. Besides, you've three days longer yet.'
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to be her doom not to meet the man for whose rival talent she
      had a despairing admiration, and to whose person she was now absolutely
      attached. Yet she determined to make a last effort; and having gathered
      from her landlady that Trewe was living in a lonely spot not far from the
      fashionable town on the Island opposite, she crossed over in the packet
      from the neighbouring pier the following afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a useless journey it was! Ella knew but vaguely where the house
      stood, and when she fancied she had found it, and ventured to inquire of a
      pedestrian if he lived there, the answer returned by the man was that he
      did not know. And if he did live there, how could she call upon him? Some
      women might have the assurance to do it, but she had not. How crazy he
      would think her. She might have asked him to call upon her, perhaps; but
      she had not the courage for that, either. She lingered mournfully about
      the picturesque seaside eminence till it was time to return to the town
      and enter the steamer for recrossing, reaching home for dinner without
      having been greatly missed.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the last moment, unexpectedly enough, her husband said that he should
      have no objection to letting her and the children stay on till the end of
      the week, since she wished to do so, if she felt herself able to get home
      without him. She concealed the pleasure this extension of time gave her;
      and Marchmill went off the next morning alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the week passed, and Trewe did not call.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Saturday morning the remaining members of the Marchmill family departed
      from the place which had been productive of so much fervour in her. The
      dreary, dreary train; the sun shining in moted beams upon the hot
      cushions; the dusty permanent way; the mean rows of wire-these things were
      her accompaniment: while out of the window the deep blue sea-levels
      disappeared from her gaze, and with them her poet's home. Heavy-hearted,
      she tried to read, and wept instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Marchmill was in a thriving way of business, and he and his family
      lived in a large new house, which stood in rather extensive grounds a few
      miles outside the city wherein he carried on his trade. Ella's life was
      lonely here, as the suburban life is apt to be, particularly at certain
      seasons; and she had ample time to indulge her taste for lyric and elegiac
      composition. She had hardly got back when she encountered a piece by
      Robert Trewe in the new number of her favourite magazine, which must have
      been written almost immediately before her visit to Solentsea, for it
      contained the very couplet she had seen pencilled on the wallpaper by the
      bed, and Mrs. Hooper had declared to be recent. Ella could resist no
      longer, but seizing a pen impulsively, wrote to him as a brother-poet,
      using the name of John Ivy, congratulating him in her letter on his
      triumphant executions in metre and rhythm of thoughts that moved his soul,
      as compared with her own brow-beaten efforts in the same pathetic trade.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this address there came a response in a few days, little as she had
      dared to hope for it-a civil and brief note, in which the young poet
      stated that, though he was not well acquainted with Mr. Ivy's verse, he
      recalled the name as being one he had seen attached to some very promising
      pieces; that he was glad to gain Mr. Ivy's acquaintance by letter, and
      should certainly look with much interest for his productions in the
      future.
    </p>
    <p>
      There must have been something juvenile or timid in her own epistle, as
      one ostensibly coming from a man, she declared to herself; for Trewe quite
      adopted the tone of an elder and superior in this reply. But what did it
      matter? he had replied; he had written to her with his own hand from that
      very room she knew so well, for he was now back again in his quarters.
    </p>
    <p>
      The correspondence thus begun was continued for two months or more, Ella
      Marchmill sending him from time to time some that she considered to be the
      best of her pieces, which he very kindly accepted, though he did not say
      he sedulously read them, nor did he send her any of his own in return.
      Ella would have been more hurt at this than she was if she had not known
      that Trewe laboured under the impression that she was one of his own sex.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet the situation was unsatisfactory. A flattering little voice told her
      that, were he only to see her, matters would be otherwise. No doubt she
      would have helped on this by making a frank confession of womanhood, to
      begin with, if something had not happened, to her delight, to render it
      unnecessary. A friend of her husband's, the editor of the most important
      newspaper in the city and county, who was dining with them one day,
      observed during their conversation about the poet that his (the editor's)
      brother the landscape-painter was a friend of Mr. Trewe's, and that the
      two men were at that very moment in Wales together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ella was slightly acquainted with the editor's brother. The next morning
      down she sat and wrote, inviting him to stay at her house for a short time
      on his way back, and requesting him to bring with him, if practicable, his
      companion Mr. Trewe, whose acquaintance she was anxious to make. The
      answer arrived after some few days. Her correspondent and his friend Trewe
      would have much satisfaction in accepting her invitation on their way
      southward, which would be on such and such a day in the following week.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ella was blithe and buoyant. Her scheme had succeeded; her beloved though
      as yet unseen one was coming. "Behold, he standeth behind our wall; he
      looked forth at the windows, showing himself through the lattice," she
      thought ecstatically. "And, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and
      gone, the flowers appear on the earth, the time of the singing of birds is
      come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land."
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was necessary to consider the details of lodging and feeding him.
      This she did most solicitously, and awaited the pregnant day and hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was about five in the afternoon when she heard a ring at the door and
      the editor's brother's voice in the hall. Poetess as she was, or as she
      thought herself, she had not been too sublime that day to dress with
      infinite trouble in a fashionable robe of rich material, having a faint
      resemblance to the chiton of the Greeks, a style just then in vogue among
      ladies of an artistic and romantic turn, which had been obtained by Ella
      of her Bond Street dressmaker when she was last in London. Her visitor
      entered the drawing-room. She looked towards his rear; nobody else came
      through the door. Where, in the name of the God of Love, was Robert Trewe?
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, I'm sorry,' said the painter, after their introductory words had been
      spoken. 'Trewe is a curious fellow, you know, Mrs. Marchmill. He said he'd
      come; then he said he couldn't. He's rather dusty. We've been doing a few
      miles with knapsacks, you know; and he wanted to get on home.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He-he's not coming?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He's not; and he asked me to make his apologies.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'When did you p-p-part from him?' she asked, her nether lip starting off
      quivering so much that it was like a tremolo-stop opened in her speech.
      She longed to run away from this dreadful bore and cry her eyes out.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Just now, in the turnpike road yonder there.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What! he has actually gone past my gates?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. When we got to them-handsome gates they are, too, the finest bit of
      modern wrought-iron work I have seen-when we came to them we stopped,
      talking there a little while, and then he wished me good-bye and went on.
      The truth is, he's a little bit depressed just now, and doesn't want to
      see anybody. He's a very good fellow, and a warm friend, but a little
      uncertain and gloomy sometimes; he thinks too much of things. His poetry
      is rather too erotic and passionate, you know, for some tastes; and he has
      just come in for a terrible slating from the &mdash;- Review that was
      published yesterday; he saw a copy of it at the station by accident.
      Perhaps you've read it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'So much the better. O, it is not worth thinking of; just one of those
      articles written to order, to please the narrow-minded set of subscribers
      upon whom the circulation depends. But he's upset by it. He says it is the
      misrepresentation that hurts him so; that, though he can stand a fair
      attack, he can't stand lies that he's powerless to refute and stop from
      spreading. That's just Trewe's weak point. He lives so much by himself
      that these things affect him much more than they would if he were in the
      bustle of fashionable or commercial life. So he wouldn't come here, making
      the excuse that it all looked so new and monied-if you'll pardon-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But-he must have known-there was sympathy here! Has he never said
      anything about getting letters from this address?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, yes, he has, from John Ivy-perhaps a relative of yours, he thought,
      visiting here at the time?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Did he-like Ivy, did he say?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I don't know that he took any great interest in Ivy.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Or in his poems?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Or in his poems-so far as I know, that is.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Robert Trewe took no interest in her house, in her poems, or in their
      writer. As soon as she could get away she went into the nursery and tried
      to let off her emotion by unnecessarily kissing the children, till she had
      a sudden sense of disgust at being reminded how plain-looking they were,
      like their father.
    </p>
    <p>
      The obtuse and single-minded landscape-painter never once perceived from
      her conversation that it was only Trewe she wanted, and not himself. He
      made the best of his visit, seeming to enjoy the society of Ella's
      husband, who also took a great fancy to him, and showed him everywhere
      about the neighbourhood, neither of them noticing Ella's mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The painter had been gone only a day or two when, while sitting upstairs
      alone one morning, she glanced over the London paper just arrived, and
      read the following paragraph:-
    </p>
    <h3>
      'SUICIDE OF A POET
    </h3>
    <p>
      'Mr. Robert Trewe, who has been favourably known for some years as one of
      our rising lyrists, committed suicide at his lodgings at Solentsea on
      Saturday evening last by shooting himself in the right temple with a
      revolver. Readers hardly need to be reminded that Mr. Trewe has recently
      attracted the attention of a much wider public than had hitherto known
      him, by his new volume of verse, mostly of an impassioned kind, entitled
      "Lyrics to a Woman Unknown," which has been already favourably noticed in
      these pages for the extraordinary gamut of feeling it traverses, and which
      has been made the subject of a severe, if not ferocious, criticism in the
      &mdash;- Review. It is supposed, though not certainly known, that the
      article may have partially conduced to the sad act, as a copy of the
      review in question was found on his writing-table; and he has been
      observed to be in a somewhat depressed state of mind since the critique
      appeared.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the report of the inquest, at which the following letter was
      read, it having been addressed to a friend at a distance:-
    </p>
    <p>
      'DEAR -,-Before these lines reach your hands I shall be delivered from the
      inconveniences of seeing, hearing, and knowing more of the things around
      me. I will not trouble you by giving my reasons for the step I have taken,
      though I can assure you they were sound and logical. Perhaps had I been
      blessed with a mother, or a sister, or a female friend of another sort
      tenderly devoted to me, I might have thought it worth while to continue my
      present existence. I have long dreamt of such an unattainable creature, as
      you know, and she, this undiscoverable, elusive one, inspired my last
      volume; the imaginary woman alone, for, in spite of what has been said in
      some quarters, there is no real woman behind the title. She has continued
      to the last unrevealed, unmet, unwon. I think it desirable to mention this
      in order that no blame may attach to any real woman as having been the
      cause of my decease by cruel or cavalier treatment of me. Tell my landlady
      that I am sorry to have caused her this unpleasantness; but my occupancy
      of the rooms will soon be forgotten. There are ample funds in my name at
      the bank to pay all expenses. R. TREWE.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Ella sat for a while as if stunned, then rushed into the adjoining chamber
      and flung herself upon her face on the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her grief and distraction shook her to pieces; and she lay in this frenzy
      of sorrow for more than an hour. Broken words came every now and then from
      her quivering lips: 'O, if he had only known of me-known of me-me! . . .
      O, if I had only once met him-only once; and put my hand upon his hot
      forehead-kissed him-let him know how I loved him-that I would have
      suffered shame and scorn, would have lived and died, for him! Perhaps it
      would have saved his dear life! . . . But no-it was not allowed! God is a
      jealous God; and that happiness was not for him and me!'
    </p>
    <p>
      All possibilities were over; the meeting was stultified. Yet it was almost
      visible to her in her fantasy even now, though it could never be
      substantiated -
    </p>
    <p>
      'The hour which might have been, yet might not be, Which man's and woman's
      heart conceived and bore, Yet whereof life was barren.'
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      She wrote to the landlady at Solentsea in the third person, in as subdued
      a style as she could command, enclosing a postal order for a sovereign,
      and informing Mrs. Hooper that Mrs. Marchmill had seen in the papers the
      sad account of the poet's death, and having been, as Mrs. Hooper was
      aware, much interested in Mr. Trewe during her stay at Coburg House, she
      would be obliged if Mrs. Hooper could obtain a small portion of his hair
      before his coffin was closed down, and send it her as a memorial of him,
      as also the photograph that was in the frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the return-post a letter arrived containing what had been requested.
      Ella wept over the portrait and secured it in her private drawer; the lock
      of hair she tied with white ribbon and put in her bosom, whence she drew
      it and kissed it every now and then in some unobserved nook.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What's the matter?' said her husband, looking up from his newspaper on
      one of these occasions. 'Crying over something? A lock of hair? Whose is
      it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He's dead!' she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't want to tell you, Will, just now, unless you insist!' she said, a
      sob hanging heavy in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, all right.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you mind my refusing? I will tell you some day.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It doesn't matter in the least, of course.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked away whistling a few bars of no tune in particular; and when he
      had got down to his factory in the city the subject came into Marchmill's
      head again.
    </p>
    <p>
      He, too, was aware that a suicide had taken place recently at the house
      they had occupied at Solentsea. Having seen the volume of poems in his
      wife's hand of late, and heard fragments of the landlady's conversation
      about Trewe when they were her tenants, he all at once said to himself;
      'Why of course it's he! How the devil did she get to know him? What sly
      animals women are!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he placidly dismissed the matter, and went on with his daily affairs.
      By this time Ella at home had come to a determination. Mrs. Hooper, in
      sending the hair and photograph, had informed her of the day of the
      funeral; and as the morning and noon wore on an overpowering wish to know
      where they were laying him took possession of the sympathetic woman.
      Caring very little now what her husband or any one else might think of her
      eccentricities; she wrote Marchmill a brief note, stating that she was
      called away for the afternoon and evening, but would return on the
      following morning. This she left on his desk, and having given the same
      information to the servants, went out of the house on foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. Marchmill reached home early in the afternoon the servants looked
      anxious. The nurse took him privately aside, and hinted that her
      mistress's sadness during the past few days had been such that she feared
      she had gone out to drown herself. Marchmill reflected. Upon the whole he
      thought that she had not done that. Without saying whither he was bound he
      also started off, telling them not to sit up for him. He drove to the
      railway-station, and took a ticket for Solentsea.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was dark when he reached the place, though he had come by a fast train,
      and he knew that if his wife had preceded him thither it could only have
      been by a slower train, arriving not a great while before his own. The
      season at Solentsea was now past: the parade was gloomy, and the flys were
      few and cheap. He asked the way to the Cemetery, and soon reached it. The
      gate was locked, but the keeper let him in, declaring, however, that there
      was nobody within the precincts. Although it was not late, the autumnal
      darkness had now become intense; and he found some difficulty in keeping
      to the serpentine path which led to the quarter where, as the man had told
      him, the one or two interments for the day had taken place. He stepped
      upon the grass, and, stumbling over some pegs, stooped now and then to
      discern if possible a figure against the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could see none; but lighting on a spot where the soil was trodden,
      beheld a crouching object beside a newly made grave. She heard him, and
      sprang up.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ell, how silly this is!' he said indignantly. 'Running away from home-I
      never heard such a thing! Of course I am not jealous of this unfortunate
      man; but it is too ridiculous that you, a married woman with three
      children and a fourth coming, should go losing your head like this over a
      dead lover! . . . Do you know you were locked in? You might not have been
      able to get out all night.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I hope it didn't go far between you and him, for your own sake.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't insult me, Will.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mind, I won't have any more of this sort of thing; do you hear?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very well,' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew her arm within his own, and conducted her out of the Cemetery. It
      was impossible to get back that night; and not wishing to be recognized in
      their present sorry condition, he took her to a miserable little
      coffee-house close to the station, whence they departed early in the
      morning, travelling almost without speaking, under the sense that it was
      one of those dreary situations occurring in married life which words could
      not mend, and reaching their own door at noon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The months passed, and neither of the twain ever ventured to start a
      conversation upon this episode. Ella seemed to be only too frequently in a
      sad and listless mood, which might almost have been called pining. The
      time was approaching when she would have to undergo the stress of
      childbirth for a fourth time, and that apparently did not tend to raise
      her spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't think I shall get over it this time!' she said one day.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Pooh! what childish foreboding! Why shouldn't it be as well now as ever?'
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head. 'I feel almost sure I am going to die; and I should be
      glad, if it were not for Nelly, and Frank, and Tiny.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And me!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You'll soon find somebody to fill my place,' she murmured, with a sad
      smile. 'And you'll have a perfect right to; I assure you of that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ell, you are not thinking still about that-poetical friend of yours?'
    </p>
    <p>
      She neither admitted nor denied the charge. 'I am not going to get over my
      illness this time,' she reiterated. 'Something tells me I shan't.'
    </p>
    <p>
      This view of things was rather a bad beginning, as it usually is; and, in
      fact, six weeks later, in the month of May, she was lying in her room,
      pulseless and bloodless, with hardly strength enough left to follow up one
      feeble breath with another, the infant for whose unnecessary life she was
      slowly parting with her own being fat and well. Just before her death she
      spoke to Marchmill softly:-
    </p>
    <p>
      'Will, I want to confess to you the entire circumstances of that-about you
      know what-that time we visited Solentsea. I can't tell what possessed
      me-how I could forget you so, my husband! But I had got into a morbid
      state: I thought you had been unkind; that you had neglected me; that you
      weren't up to my intellectual level, while he was, and far above it. I
      wanted a fuller appreciator, perhaps, rather than another lover-'
    </p>
    <p>
      She could get no further then for very exhaustion; and she went off in
      sudden collapse a few hours later, without having said anything more to
      her husband on the subject of her love for the poet. William Marchmill, in
      truth, like most husbands of several years' standing, was little disturbed
      by retrospective jealousies, and had not shown the least anxiety to press
      her for confessions concerning a man dead and gone beyond any power of
      inconveniencing him more.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when she had been buried a couple of years it chanced one day that, in
      turning over some forgotten papers that he wished to destroy before his
      second wife entered the house, he lighted on a lock of hair in an
      envelope, with the photograph of the deceased poet, a date being written
      on the back in his late wife's hand. It was that of the time they spent at
      Solentsea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marchmill looked long and musingly at the hair and portrait, for something
      struck him. Fetching the little boy who had been the death of his mother,
      now a noisy toddler, he took him on his knee, held the lock of hair
      against the child's head, and set up the photograph on the table behind,
      so that he could closely compare the features each countenance presented.
      There were undoubtedly strong traces of resemblance; the dreamy and
      peculiar expression of the poet's face sat, as the transmitted idea, upon
      the child's, and the hair was of the same hue.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'm damned if I didn't think so!' murmured Marchmill. 'Then she did play
      me false with that fellow at the lodgings! Let me see: the dates-the
      second week in August . . . the third week in May . . . Yes . . . yes . .
      . Get away, you poor little brat! You are nothing to me!'

    <h2>
      THE THREE STRANGERS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Among the few features of agricultural England which retain an appearance
      but little modified by the lapse of centuries, may be reckoned the high,
      grassy and furzy downs, coombs, or ewe-leases, as they are indifferently
      called, that fill a large area of certain counties in the south and
      south-west. If any mark of human occupation is met with hereon, it usually
      takes the form of the solitary cottage of some shepherd.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fifty years ago such a lonely cottage stood on such a down, and may
      possibly be standing there now. In spite of its loneliness, however, the
      spot, by actual measurement, was not more than five miles from a
      county-town. Yet that affected it little. Five miles of irregular upland,
      during the long inimical seasons, with their sleets, snows, rains, and
      mists, afford withdrawing space enough to isolate a Timon or a
      Nebuchadnezzar; much less, in fair weather, to please that less repellent
      tribe, the poets, philosophers, artists, and others who 'conceive and
      meditate of pleasant things.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Some old earthen camp or barrow, some clump of trees, at least some
      starved fragment of ancient hedge is usually taken advantage of in the
      erection of these forlorn dwellings. But, in the present case, such a kind
      of shelter had been disregarded. Higher Crowstairs, as the house was
      called, stood quite detached and undefended. The only reason for its
      precise situation seemed to be the crossing of two footpaths at right
      angles hard by, which may have crossed there and thus for a good five
      hundred years. Hence the house was exposed to the elements on all sides.
      But, though the wind up here blew unmistakably when it did blow, and the
      rain hit hard whenever it fell, the various weathers of the winter season
      were not quite so formidable on the coomb as they were imagined to be by
      dwellers on low ground. The raw rimes were not so pernicious as in the
      hollows, and the frosts were scarcely so severe. When the shepherd and his
      family who tenanted the house were pitied for their sufferings from the
      exposure, they said that upon the whole they were less inconvenienced by
      'wuzzes and flames' (hoarses and phlegms) than when they had lived by the
      stream of a snug neighbouring valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night of March 28, 182-, was precisely one of the nights that were
      wont to call forth these expressions of commiseration. The level rainstorm
      smote walls, slopes, and hedges like the clothyard shafts of Senlac and
      Crecy. Such sheep and outdoor animals as had no shelter stood with their
      buttocks to the winds; while the tails of little birds trying to roost on
      some scraggy thorn were blown inside-out like umbrellas. The gable-end of
      the cottage was stained with wet, and the eavesdroppings flapped against
      the wall. Yet never was commiseration for the shepherd more misplaced. For
      that cheerful rustic was entertaining a large party in glorification of
      the christening of his second girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      The guests had arrived before the rain began to fall, and they were all
      now assembled in the chief or living room of the dwelling. A glance into
      the apartment at eight o'clock on this eventful evening would have
      resulted in the opinion that it was as cosy and comfortable a nook as
      could be wished for in boisterous weather. The calling of its inhabitant
      was proclaimed by a number of highly-polished sheep-crooks without stems
      that were hung ornamentally over the fireplace, the curl of each shining
      crook varying from the antiquated type engraved in the patriarchal
      pictures of old family Bibles to the most approved fashion of the last
      local sheep-fair. The room was lighted by half-a-dozen candles, having
      wicks only a trifle smaller than the grease which enveloped them, in
      candlesticks that were never used but at high-days, holy-days, and family
      feasts. The lights were scattered about the room, two of them standing on
      the chimney-piece. This position of candles was in itself significant.
      Candles on the chimney-piece always meant a party.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the hearth, in front of a back-brand to give substance, blazed a fire
      of thorns, that crackled 'like the laughter of the fool.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Nineteen persons were gathered here. Of these, five women, wearing gowns
      of various bright hues, sat in chairs along the wall; girls shy and not
      shy filled the window-bench; four men, including Charley Jake the
      hedge-carpenter, Elijah New the parish-clerk, and John Pitcher, a
      neighbouring dairyman, the shepherd's father-in-law, lolled in the settle;
      a young man and maid, who were blushing over tentative pourparlers on a
      life-companionship, sat beneath the corner-cupboard; and an elderly
      engaged man of fifty or upward moved restlessly about from spots where his
      betrothed was not to the spot where she was. Enjoyment was pretty general,
      and so much the more prevailed in being unhampered by conventional
      restrictions. Absolute confidence in each other's good opinion begat
      perfect ease, while the finishing stroke of manner, amounting to a truly
      princely serenity, was lent to the majority by the absence of any
      expression or trait denoting that they wished to get on in the world,
      enlarge their minds, or do any eclipsing thing whatever-which nowadays so
      generally nips the bloom and bonhomie of all except the two extremes of
      the social scale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shepherd Fennel had married well, his wife being a dairyman's daughter
      from a vale at a distance, who brought fifty guineas in her pocket-and
      kept them there, till they should be required for ministering to the needs
      of a coming family. This frugal woman had been somewhat exercised as to
      the character that should be given to the gathering. A sit-still party had
      its advantages; but an undisturbed position of ease in chairs and settles
      was apt to lead on the men to such an unconscionable deal of toping that
      they would sometimes fairly drink the house dry. A dancing- party was the
      alternative; but this, while avoiding the foregoing objection on the score
      of good drink, had a counterbalancing disadvantage in the matter of good
      victuals, the ravenous appetites engendered by the exercise causing
      immense havoc in the buttery. Shepherdess Fennel fell back upon the
      intermediate plan of mingling short dances with short periods of talk and
      singing, so as to hinder any ungovernable rage in either. But this scheme
      was entirely confined to her own gentle mind: the shepherd himself was in
      the mood to exhibit the most reckless phases of hospitality.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fiddler was a boy of those parts, about twelve years of age, who had a
      wonderful dexterity in jigs and reels, though his fingers were so small
      and short as to necessitate a constant shifting for the high notes, from
      which he scrambled back to the first position with sounds not of unmixed
      purity of tone. At seven the shrill tweedle-dee of this youngster had
      begun, accompanied by a booming ground-bass from Elijah New, the
      parish-clerk, who had thoughtfully brought with him his favourite musical
      instrument, the serpent. Dancing was instantaneous, Mrs. Fennel privately
      enjoining the players on no account to let the dance exceed the length of
      a quarter of an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Elijah and the boy, in the excitement of their position, quite forgot
      the injunction. Moreover, Oliver Giles, a man of seventeen, one of the
      dancers, who was enamoured of his partner, a fair girl of thirty- three
      rolling years, had recklessly handed a new crown-piece to the musicians,
      as a bribe to keep going as long as they had muscle and wind. Mrs. Fennel,
      seeing the steam begin to generate on the countenances of her guests,
      crossed over and touched the fiddler's elbow and put her hand on the
      serpent's mouth. But they took no notice, and fearing she might lose her
      character of genial hostess if she were to interfere too markedly, she
      retired and sat down helpless. And so the dance whizzed on with cumulative
      fury, the performers moving in their planet-like courses, direct and
      retrograde, from apogee to perigee, till the hand of the well-kicked clock
      at the bottom of the room had travelled over the circumference of an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      While these cheerful events were in course of enactment within Fennel's
      pastoral dwelling, an incident having considerable bearing on the party
      had occurred in the gloomy night without. Mrs. Fennel's concern about the
      growing fierceness of the dance corresponded in point of time with the
      ascent of a human figure to the solitary hill of Higher Crowstairs from
      the direction of the distant town. This personage strode on through the
      rain without a pause, following the little-worn path which, further on in
      its course, skirted the shepherd's cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nearly the time of full moon, and on this account, though the sky
      was lined with a uniform sheet of dripping cloud, ordinary objects out of
      doors were readily visible. The sad wan light revealed the lonely
      pedestrian to be a man of supple frame; his gait suggested that he had
      somewhat passed the period of perfect and instinctive agility, though not
      so far as to be otherwise than rapid of motion when occasion required. At
      a rough guess, he might have been about forty years of age. He appeared
      tall, but a recruiting sergeant, or other person accustomed to the judging
      of men's heights by the eye, would have discerned that this was chiefly
      owing to his gauntness, and that he was not more than five-feet-eight or
      nine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding the regularity of his tread, there was caution in it, as
      in that of one who mentally feels his way; and despite the fact that it
      was not a black coat nor a dark garment of any sort that he wore, there
      was something about him which suggested that he naturally belonged to the
      black-coated tribes of men. His clothes were of fustian, and his boots
      hobnailed, yet in his progress he showed not the mud-accustomed bearing of
      hobnailed and fustianed peasantry.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time that he had arrived abreast of the shepherd's premises the
      rain came down, or rather came along, with yet more determined violence.
      The outskirts of the little settlement partially broke the force of wind
      and rain, and this induced him to stand still. The most salient of the
      shepherd's domestic erections was an empty sty at the forward corner of
      his hedgeless garden, for in these latitudes the principle of masking the
      homelier features of your establishment by a conventional frontage was
      unknown. The traveller's eye was attracted to this small building by the
      pallid shine of the wet slates that covered it. He turned aside, and,
      finding it empty, stood under the pent-roof for shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he stood, the boom of the serpent within the adjacent house, and the
      lesser strains of the fiddler, reached the spot as an accompaniment to the
      surging hiss of the flying rain on the sod, its louder beating on the
      cabbage-leaves of the garden, on the eight or ten beehives just
      discernible by the path, and its dripping from the eaves into a row of
      buckets and pans that had been placed under the walls of the cottage. For
      at Higher Crowstairs, as at all such elevated domiciles, the grand
      difficulty of housekeeping was an insufficiency of water; and a casual
      rainfall was utilized by turning out, as catchers, every utensil that the
      house contained. Some queer stories might be told of the contrivances for
      economy in suds and dish-waters that are absolutely necessitated in upland
      habitations during the droughts of summer. But at this season there were
      no such exigencies; a mere acceptance of what the skies bestowed was
      sufficient for an abundant store.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the notes of the serpent ceased and the house was silent. This
      cessation of activity aroused the solitary pedestrian from the reverie
      into which he had lapsed, and, emerging from the shed, with an apparently
      new intention, he walked up the path to the house-door. Arrived here, his
      first act was to kneel down on a large stone beside the row of vessels,
      and to drink a copious draught from one of them. Having quenched his
      thirst he rose and lifted his hand to knock, but paused with his eye upon
      the panel. Since the dark surface of the wood revealed absolutely nothing,
      it was evident that he must be mentally looking through the door, as if he
      wished to measure thereby all the possibilities that a house of this sort
      might include, and how they might bear upon the question of his entry.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his indecision he turned and surveyed the scene around. Not a soul was
      anywhere visible. The garden-path stretched downward from his feet,
      gleaming like the track of a snail; the roof of the little well (mostly
      dry), the well-cover, the top rail of the garden-gate, were varnished with
      the same dull liquid glaze; while, far away in the vale, a faint whiteness
      of more than usual extent showed that the rivers were high in the meads.
      Beyond all this winked a few bleared lamplights through the beating
      drops-lights that denoted the situation of the county-town from which he
      had appeared to come. The absence of all notes of life in that direction
      seemed to clinch his intentions, and he knocked at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within, a desultory chat had taken the place of movement and musical
      sound. The hedge-carpenter was suggesting a song to the company, which
      nobody just then was inclined to undertake, so that the knock afforded a
      not unwelcome diversion.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Walk in!' said the shepherd promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latch clicked upward, and out of the night our pedestrian appeared
      upon the door-mat. The shepherd arose, snuffed two of the nearest candles,
      and turned to look at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their light disclosed that the stranger was dark in complexion and not
      unprepossessing as to feature. His hat, which for a moment he did not
      remove, hung low over his eyes, without concealing that they were large,
      open, and determined, moving with a flash rather than a glance round the
      room. He seemed pleased with his survey, and, baring his shaggy head,
      said, in a rich deep voice, 'The rain is so heavy, friends, that I ask
      leave to come in and rest awhile.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'To be sure, stranger,' said the shepherd. 'And faith, you've been lucky
      in choosing your time, for we are having a bit of a fling for a glad
      cause-though, to be sure, a man could hardly wish that glad cause to
      happen more than once a year.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nor less,' spoke up a woman. 'For 'tis best to get your family over and
      done with, as soon as you can, so as to be all the earlier out of the fag
      o't.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And what may be this glad cause?' asked the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      'A birth and christening,' said the shepherd.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger hoped his host might not be made unhappy either by too many
      or too few of such episodes, and being invited by a gesture to a pull at
      the mug, he readily acquiesced. His manner, which, before entering, had
      been so dubious, was now altogether that of a careless and candid man.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Late to be traipsing athwart this coomb-hey?' said the engaged man of
      fifty.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Late it is, master, as you say.-I'll take a seat in the chimney-corner,
      if you have nothing to urge against it, ma'am; for I am a little moist on
      the side that was next the rain.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Shepherd Fennel assented, and made room for the self-invited comer,
      who, having got completely inside the chimney-corner, stretched out his
      legs and his arms with the expansiveness of a person quite at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, I am rather cracked in the vamp,' he said freely, seeing that the
      eyes of the shepherd's wife fell upon his boots, 'and I am not well fitted
      either. I have had some rough times lately, and have been forced to pick
      up what I can get in the way of wearing, but I must find a suit better fit
      for working-days when I reach home.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'One of hereabouts?' she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not quite that-further up the country.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I thought so. And so be I; and by your tongue you come from my
      neighbourhood.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But you would hardly have heard of me,' he said quickly. 'My time would
      be long before yours, ma'am, you see.'
    </p>
    <p>
      This testimony to the youthfulness of his hostess had the effect of
      stopping her cross-examination.
    </p>
    <p>
      'There is only one thing more wanted to make me happy,' continued the
      new-comer. 'And that is a little baccy, which I am sorry to say I am out
      of.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll fill your pipe,' said the shepherd.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I must ask you to lend me a pipe likewise.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A smoker, and no pipe about 'ee?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have dropped it somewhere on the road.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The shepherd filled and handed him a new clay pipe, saying, as he did so,
      'Hand me your baccy-box-I'll fill that too, now I am about it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The man went through the movement of searching his pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lost that too?' said his entertainer, with some surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am afraid so,' said the man with some confusion. 'Give it to me in a
      screw of paper.' Lighting his pipe at the candle with a suction that drew
      the whole flame into the bowl, he resettled himself in the corner and bent
      his looks upon the faint steam from his damp legs, as if he wished to say
      no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the general body of guests had been taking little notice of this
      visitor by reason of an absorbing discussion in which they were engaged
      with the band about a tune for the next dance. The matter being settled,
      they were about to stand up when an interruption came in the shape of
      another knock at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      At sound of the same the man in the chimney-corner took up the poker and
      began stirring the brands as if doing it thoroughly were the one aim of
      his existence; and a second time the shepherd said, 'Walk in!' In a moment
      another man stood upon the straw-woven door-mat. He too was a stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      This individual was one of a type radically different from the first.
      There was more of the commonplace in his manner, and a certain jovial
      cosmopolitanism sat upon his features. He was several years older than the
      first arrival, his hair being slightly frosted, his eyebrows bristly, and
      his whiskers cut back from his cheeks. His face was rather full and
      flabby, and yet it was not altogether a face without power. A few
      grog-blossoms marked the neighbourhood of his nose. He flung back his long
      drab greatcoat, revealing that beneath it he wore a suit of cinder-gray
      shade throughout, large heavy seals, of some metal or other that would
      take a polish, dangling from his fob as his only personal ornament.
      Shaking the water-drops from his low-crowned glazed hat, he said, 'I must
      ask for a few minutes' shelter, comrades, or I shall be wetted to my skin
      before I get to Casterbridge.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Make yourself at home, master,' said the shepherd, perhaps a trifle less
      heartily than on the first occasion. Not that Fennel had the least tinge
      of niggardliness in his composition; but the room was far from large,
      spare chairs were not numerous, and damp companions were not altogether
      desirable at close quarters for the women and girls in their
      bright-coloured gowns.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the second comer, after taking off his greatcoat, and hanging his
      hat on a nail in one of the ceiling-beams as if he had been specially
      invited to put it there, advanced and sat down at the table. This had been
      pushed so closely into the chimney-corner, to give all available room to
      the dancers, that its inner edge grazed the elbow of the man who had
      ensconced himself by the fire; and thus the two strangers were brought
      into close companionship. They nodded to each other by way of breaking the
      ice of unacquaintance, and the first stranger handed his neighbour the
      family mug-a huge vessel of brown ware, having its upper edge worn away
      like a threshold by the rub of whole generations of thirsty lips that had
      gone the way of all flesh, and bearing the following inscription burnt
      upon its rotund side in yellow letters
    </p>
    <p>
      THERE IS NO FUN UNTiLL i CUM.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other man, nothing loth, raised the mug to his lips, and drank on, and
      on, and on-till a curious blueness overspread the countenance of the
      shepherd's wife, who had regarded with no little surprise the first
      stranger's free offer to the second of what did not belong to him to
      dispense.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I knew it!' said the toper to the shepherd with much satisfaction. 'When
      I walked up your garden before coming in, and saw the hives all of a row,
      I said to myself; "Where there's bees there's honey, and where there's
      honey there's mead." But mead of such a truly comfortable sort as this I
      really didn't expect to meet in my older days.' He took yet another pull
      at the mug, till it assumed an ominous elevation.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Glad you enjoy it!' said the shepherd warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is goodish mead,' assented Mrs. Fennel, with an absence of enthusiasm
      which seemed to say that it was possible to buy praise for one's cellar at
      too heavy a price. 'It is trouble enough to make-and really I hardly think
      we shall make any more. For honey sells well, and we ourselves can make
      shift with a drop o' small mead and metheglin for common use from the
      comb-washings.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, but you'll never have the heart!' reproachfully cried the stranger in
      cinder-gray, after taking up the mug a third time and setting it down
      empty. 'I love mead, when 'tis old like this, as I love to go to church o'
      Sundays, or to relieve the needy any day of the week.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ha, ha, ha!' said the man in the chimney-corner, who, in spite of the
      taciturnity induced by the pipe of tobacco, could not or would not refrain
      from this slight testimony to his comrade's humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the old mead of those days, brewed of the purest first-year or maiden
      honey, four pounds to the gallon-with its due complement of white of eggs,
      cinnamon, ginger, cloves, mace, rosemary, yeast, and processes of working,
      bottling, and cellaring-tasted remarkably strong; but it did not taste so
      strong as it actually was. Hence, presently, the stranger in cinder-gray
      at the table, moved by its creeping influence, unbuttoned his waistcoat,
      threw himself back in his chair, spread his legs, and made his presence
      felt in various ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, well, as I say,' he resumed, 'I am going to Casterbridge, and to
      Casterbridge I must go. I should have been almost there by this time; but
      the rain drove me into your dwelling, and I'm not sorry for it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You don't live in Casterbridge?' said the shepherd.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not as yet; though I shortly mean to move there.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Going to set up in trade, perhaps?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, no,' said the shepherd's wife. 'It is easy to see that the gentleman
      is rich, and don't want to work at anything.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The cinder-gray stranger paused, as if to consider whether he would accept
      that definition of himself. He presently rejected it by answering, 'Rich
      is not quite the word for me, dame. I do work, and I must work. And even
      if I only get to Casterbridge by midnight I must begin work there at eight
      to-morrow morning. Yes, het or wet, blow or snow, famine or sword, my
      day's work to-morrow must be done.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Poor man! Then, in spite o' seeming, you be worse off than we?' replied
      the shepherd's wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      ''Tis the nature of my trade, men and maidens. 'Tis the nature of my trade
      more than my poverty . . . But really and truly I must up and off, or I
      shan't get a lodging in the town.' However, the speaker did not move, and
      directly added, 'There's time for one more draught of friendship before I
      go; and I'd perform it at once if the mug were not dry.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Here's a mug o' small,' said Mrs. Fennel. 'Small, we call it, though to
      be sure 'tis only the first wash o' the combs.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No,' said the stranger disdainfully. 'I won't spoil your first kindness
      by partaking o' your second.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Certainly not,' broke in Fennel. 'We don't increase and multiply every
      day, and I'll fill the mug again.' He went away to the dark place under
      the stairs where the barrel stood. The shepherdess followed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why should you do this?' she said reproachfully, as soon as they were
      alone. 'He's emptied it once, though it held enough for ten people; and
      now he's not contented wi' the small, but must needs call for more o' the
      strong! And a stranger unbeknown to any of us. For my part, I don't like
      the look o' the man at all.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But he's in the house, my honey; and 'tis a wet night, and a christening.
      Daze it, what's a cup of mead more or less? There'll be plenty more next
      bee-burning.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very well-this time, then,' she answered, looking wistfully at the
      barrel. 'But what is the man's calling, and where is he one of; that he
      should come in and join us like this?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't know. I'll ask him again.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The catastrophe of having the mug drained dry at one pull by the stranger
      in cinder-gray was effectually guarded against this time by Mrs. Fennel.
      She poured out his allowance in a small cup, keeping the large one at a
      discreet distance from him. When he had tossed off his portion the
      shepherd renewed his inquiry about the stranger's occupation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter did not immediately reply, and the man in the chimney-corner,
      with sudden demonstrativeness, said, 'Anybody may know my trade-I'm a
      wheelwright.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A very good trade for these parts,' said the shepherd.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And anybody may know mine-if they've the sense to find it out,' said the
      stranger in cinder-gray.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You may generally tell what a man is by his claws,' observed the hedge-
      carpenter, looking at his own hands. 'My fingers be as full of thorns as
      an old pin-cushion is of pins.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The hands of the man in the chimney-corner instinctively sought the shade,
      and he gazed into the fire as he resumed his pipe. The man at the table
      took up the hedge-carpenter's remark, and added smartly, 'True; but the
      oddity of my trade is that, instead of setting a mark upon me, it sets a
      mark upon my customers.'
    </p>
    <p>
      No observation being offered by anybody in elucidation of this enigma, the
      shepherd's wife once more called for a song. The same obstacles presented
      themselves as at the former time-one had no voice, another had forgotten
      the first verse. The stranger at the table, whose soul had now risen to a
      good working temperature, relieved the difficulty by exclaiming that, to
      start the company, he would sing himself. Thrusting one thumb into the
      arm-hole of his waistcoat, he waved the other hand in the air, and, with
      an extemporizing gaze at the shining sheep-crooks above the mantelpiece,
      began:-
    </p>
    <p>
      'O my trade it is the rarest one, Simple shepherds all -My trade is a
      sight to see; For my customers I tie, and take them up on high, And waft
      'em to a far countree!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The room was silent when he had finished the verse-with one exception,
      that of the man in the chimney-corner, who, at the singer's word, 'Chorus!
      'joined him in a deep bass voice of musical relish -
    </p>
    <p>
      'And waft 'em to a far countree!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver Giles, John Pitcher the dairyman, the parish-clerk, the engaged man
      of fifty, the row of young women against the wall, seemed lost in thought
      not of the gayest kind. The shepherd looked meditatively on the ground,
      the shepherdess gazed keenly at the singer, and with some suspicion; she
      was doubting whether this stranger were merely singing an old song from
      recollection, or was composing one there and then for the occasion. All
      were as perplexed at the obscure revelation as the guests at Belshazzar's
      Feast, except the man in the chimney-corner, who quietly said, 'Second
      verse, stranger,' and smoked on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The singer thoroughly moistened himself from his lips inwards, and went on
      with the next stanza as requested:-
    </p>
    <p>
      'My tools are but common ones, Simple shepherds all -My tools are no sight
      to see: A little hempen string, and a post whereon to swing, Are
      implements enough for me!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Shepherd Fennel glanced round. There was no longer any doubt that the
      stranger was answering his question rhythmically. The guests one and all
      started back with suppressed exclamations. The young woman engaged to the
      man of fifty fainted half-way, and would have proceeded, but finding him
      wanting in alacrity for catching her she sat down trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, he's the-!' whispered the people in the background, mentioning the
      name of an ominous public officer. 'He's come to do it! 'Tis to be at
      Casterbridge jail to-morrow-the man for sheep-stealing-the poor clock-
      maker we heard of; who used to live away at Shottsford and had no work to
      do-Timothy Summers, whose family were a-starving, and so he went out of
      Shottsford by the high-road, and took a sheep in open daylight, defying
      the farmer and the farmer's wife and the farmer's lad, and every man jack
      among 'em. He' (and they nodded towards the stranger of the deadly trade)
      'is come from up the country to do it because there's not enough to do in
      his own county-town, and he's got the place here now our own county man's
      dead; he's going to live in the same cottage under the prison wall.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger in cinder-gray took no notice of this whispered string of
      observations, but again wetted his lips. Seeing that his friend in the
      chimney-corner was the only one who reciprocated his joviality in any way,
      he held out his cup towards that appreciative comrade, who also held out
      his own. They cWESSEXlinked together, the eyes of the rest of the room
      hanging upon the singer's actions. He parted his lips for the third verse;
      but at that moment another knock was audible upon the door. This time the
      knock was faint and hesitating.
    </p>
    <p>
      The company seemed scared; the shepherd looked with consternation towards
      the entrance, and it was with some effort that he resisted his alarmed
      wife's deprecatory glance, and uttered for the third time the welcoming
      words, 'Walk in!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The door was gently opened, and another man stood upon the mat. He, like
      those who had preceded him, was a stranger. This time it was a short,
      small personage, of fair complexion, and dressed in a decent suit of dark
      clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Can you tell me the way to-?' he began: when, gazing round the room to
      observe the nature of the company amongst whom he had fallen, his eyes
      lighted on the stranger in cinder-gray. It was just at the instant when
      the latter, who had thrown his mind into his song with such a will that he
      scarcely heeded the interruption, silenced all whispers and inquiries by
      bursting into his third verse:-
    </p>
    <p>
      'To-morrow is my working day, Simple shepherds all -To-morrow is a working
      day for me: For the farmer's sheep is slain, and the lad who did it ta'en,
      And on his soul may God ha' merc-y!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger in the chimney-corner, waving cups with the singer so
      heartily that his mead splashed over on the hearth, repeated in his bass
      voice as before:-
    </p>
    <p>
      'And on his soul may God ha' merc-y!'
    </p>
    <p>
      All this time the third stranger had been standing in the doorway. Finding
      now that he did not come forward or go on speaking, the guests
      particularly regarded him. They noticed to their surprise that he stood
      before them the picture of abject terror-his knees trembling, his hand
      shaking so violently that the door-latch by which he supported himself
      rattled audibly: his white lips were parted, and his eyes fixed on the
      merry officer of justice in the middle of the room. A moment more and he
      had turned, closed the door, and fled.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What a man can it be?' said the shepherd.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest, between the awfulness of their late discovery and the odd
      conduct of this third visitor, looked as if they knew not what to think,
      and said nothing. Instinctively they withdrew further and further from the
      grim gentleman in their midst, whom some of them seemed to take for the
      Prince of Darkness himself; till they formed a remote circle, an empty
      space of floor being left between them and him -
    </p>
    <p>
      ' . . . circulus, cujus centrum diabolus.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The room was so silent-though there were more than twenty people in
      it-that nothing could be heard but the patter of the rain against the
      window-shutters, accompanied by the occasional hiss of a stray drop that
      fell down the chimney into the fire, and the steady puffing of the man in
      the corner, who had now resumed his pipe of long clay.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stillness was unexpectedly broken. The distant sound of a gun
      reverberated through the air-apparently from the direction of the
      county-town.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Be jiggered!' cried the stranger who had sung the song, jumping up.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What does that mean?' asked several.
    </p>
    <p>
      'A prisoner escaped from the jail-that's what it means.'
    </p>
    <p>
      All listened. The sound was repeated, and none of them spoke but the man
      in the chimney-corner, who said quietly, 'I've often been told that in
      this county they fire a gun at such times; but I never heard it till now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I wonder if it is my man?' murmured the personage in cinder-gray.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Surely it is!' said the shepherd involuntarily. 'And surely we've zeed
      him! That little man who looked in at the door by now, and quivered like a
      leaf when he zeed ye and heard your song!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'His teeth chattered, and the breath went out of his body,' said the
      dairyman.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And his heart seemed to sink within him like a stone,' said Oliver Giles.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And he bolted as if he'd been shot at,' said the hedge-carpenter.
    </p>
    <p>
      'True-his teeth chattered, and his heart seemed to sink; and he bolted as
      if he'd been shot at,' slowly summed up the man in the chimney- corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I didn't notice it,' remarked the hangman.
    </p>
    <p>
      'We were all a-wondering what made him run off in such a fright,' faltered
      one of the women against the wall, 'and now 'tis explained!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The firing of the alarm-gun went on at intervals, low and sullenly, and
      their suspicions became a certainty. The sinister gentleman in cinder-
      gray roused himself. 'Is there a constable here?' he asked, in thick
      tones. 'If so, let him step forward.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The engaged man of fifty stepped quavering out from the wall, his
      betrothed beginning to sob on the back of the chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are a sworn constable?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I be, sir.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then pursue the criminal at once, with assistance, and bring him back
      here. He can't have gone far.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will, sir, I will-when I've got my staff. I'll go home and get it, and
      come sharp here, and start in a body.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Staff!-never mind your staff; the man'll be gone!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But I can't do nothing without my staff-can I, William, and John, and
      Charles Jake? No; for there's the king's royal crown a painted on en in
      yaller and gold, and the lion and the unicorn, so as when I raise en up
      and hit my prisoner, 'tis made a lawful blow thereby. I wouldn't 'tempt to
      take up a man without my staff-no, not I. If I hadn't the law to gie me
      courage, why, instead o' my taking up him he might take up me!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now, I'm a king's man myself; and can give you authority enough for
      this,' said the formidable officer in gray. 'Now then, all of ye, be
      ready. Have ye any lanterns?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes-have ye any lanterns?-I demand it!' said the constable.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And the rest of you able-bodied-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Able-bodied men-yes-the rest of ye!' said the constable.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Have you some good stout staves and pitch-forks-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Staves and pitchforks-in the name o' the law! And take 'em in yer hands
      and go in quest, and do as we in authority tell ye!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus aroused, the men prepared to give chase. The evidence was, indeed,
      though circumstantial, so convincing, that but little argument was needed
      to show the shepherd's guests that after what they had seen it would look
      very much like connivance if they did not instantly pursue the unhappy
      third stranger, who could not as yet have gone more than a few hundred
      yards over such uneven country.
    </p>
    <p>
      A shepherd is always well provided with lanterns; and, lighting these
      hastily, and with hurdle-staves in their hands, they poured out of the
      door, taking a direction along the crest of the hill, away from the town,
      the rain having fortunately a little abated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Disturbed by the noise, or possibly by unpleasant dreams of her baptism,
      the child who had been christened began to cry heart-brokenly in the room
      overhead. These notes of grief came down through the chinks of the floor
      to the ears of the women below, who jumped up one by one, and seemed glad
      of the excuse to ascend and comfort the baby, for the incidents of the
      last half-hour greatly oppressed them. Thus in the space of two or three
      minutes the room on the ground-floor was deserted quite.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was not for long. Hardly had the sound of footsteps died away when
      a man returned round the corner of the house from the direction the
      pursuers had taken. Peeping in at the door, and seeing nobody there, he
      entered leisurely. It was the stranger of the chimney-corner, who had gone
      out with the rest. The motive of his return was shown by his helping
      himself to a cut piece of skimmer-cake that lay on a ledge beside where he
      had sat, and which he had apparently forgotten to take with him. He also
      poured out half a cup more mead from the quantity that remained,
      ravenously eating and drinking these as he stood. He had not finished when
      another figure came in just as quietly-his friend in cinder-gray.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O-you here?' said the latter, smiling. 'I thought you had gone to help in
      the capture.' And this speaker also revealed the object of his return by
      looking solicitously round for the fascinating mug of old mead.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And I thought you had gone,' said the other, continuing his skimmer- cake
      with some effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, on second thoughts, I felt there were enough without me,' said the
      first confidentially, 'and such a night as it is, too. Besides, 'tis the
      business o' the Government to take care of its criminals-not mine.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'True; so it is. And I felt as you did, that there were enough without
      me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't want to break my limbs running over the humps and hollows of this
      wild country.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nor I neither, between you and me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'These shepherd-people are used to it-simple-minded souls, you know,
      stirred up to anything in a moment. They'll have him ready for me before
      the morning, and no trouble to me at all.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'They'll have him, and we shall have saved ourselves all labour in the
      matter.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'True, true. Well, my way is to Casterbridge; and 'tis as much as my legs
      will do to take me that far. Going the same way?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, I am sorry to say! I have to get home over there' (he nodded
      indefinitely to the right), 'and I feel as you do, that it is quite enough
      for my legs to do before bedtime.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The other had by this time finished the mead in the mug, after which,
      shaking hands heartily at the door, and wishing each other well, they went
      their several ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime the company of pursuers had reached the end of the
      hog's-back elevation which dominated this part of the down. They had
      decided on no particular plan of action; and, finding that the man of the
      baleful trade was no longer in their company, they seemed quite unable to
      form any such plan now. They descended in all directions down the hill,
      and straightway several of the party fell into the snare set by Nature for
      all misguided midnight ramblers over this part of the cretaceous
      formation. The 'lanchets,' or flint slopes, which belted the escarpment at
      intervals of a dozen yards, took the less cautious ones unawares, and
      losing their footing on the rubbly steep they slid sharply downwards, the
      lanterns rolling from their hands to the bottom, and there lying on their
      sides till the horn was scorched through.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had again gathered themselves together, the shepherd, as the man
      who knew the country best, took the lead, and guided them round these
      treacherous inclines. The lanterns, which seemed rather to dazzle their
      eyes and warn the fugitive than to assist them in the exploration, were
      extinguished, due silence was observed; and in this more rational order
      they plunged into the vale. It was a grassy, briery, moist defile,
      affording some shelter to any person who had sought it; but the party
      perambulated it in vain, and ascended on the other side. Here they
      wandered apart, and after an interval closed together again to report
      progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the second time of closing in they found themselves near a lonely ash,
      the single tree on this part of the coomb, probably sown there by a
      passing bird some fifty years before. And here, standing a little to one
      side of the trunk, as motionless as the trunk itself; appeared the man
      they were in quest of; his outline being well defined against the sky
      beyond. The band noiselessly drew up and faced him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Your money or your life!' said the constable sternly to the still figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, no,' whispered John Pitcher. ''Tisn't our side ought to say that.
      That's the doctrine of vagabonds like him, and we be on the side of the
      law.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, well,' replied the constable impatiently; 'I must say something,
      mustn't I? and if you had all the weight o' this undertaking upon your
      mind, perhaps you'd say the wrong thing too!-Prisoner at the bar,
      surrender, in the name of the Father-the Crown, I mane!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The man under the tree seemed now to notice them for the first time, and,
      giving them no opportunity whatever for exhibiting their courage, he
      strolled slowly towards them. He was, indeed, the little man, the third
      stranger; but his trepidation had in a great measure gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, travellers,' he said, 'did I hear ye speak to me?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You did: you've got to come and be our prisoner at once!' said the
      constable. 'We arrest 'ee on the charge of not biding in Casterbridge jail
      in a decent proper manner to be hung to-morrow morning. Neighbours, do
      your duty, and seize the culpet!'
    </p>
    <p>
      On hearing the charge, the man seemed enlightened, and, saying not another
      word, resigned himself with preternatural civility to the search-party,
      who, with their staves in their hands, surrounded him on all sides, and
      marched him back towards the shepherd's cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was eleven o'clock by the time they arrived. The light shining from the
      open door, a sound of men's voices within, proclaimed to them as they
      approached the house that some new events had arisen in their absence. On
      entering they discovered the shepherd's living room to be invaded by two
      officers from Casterbridge jail, and a well-known magistrate who lived at
      the nearest country-seat, intelligence of the escape having become
      generally circulated.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Gentlemen,' said the constable, 'I have brought back your man-not without
      risk and danger; but every one must do his duty! He is inside this circle
      of able-bodied persons, who have lent me useful aid, considering their
      ignorance of Crown work. Men, bring forward your prisoner!' And the third
      stranger was led to the light.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who is this?' said one of the officials.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The man,' said the constable.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Certainly not,' said the turnkey; and the first corroborated his
      statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But how can it be otherwise?' asked the constable. 'Or why was he so
      terrified at sight o' the singing instrument of the law who sat there?'
      Here he related the strange behaviour of the third stranger on entering
      the house during the hangman's song.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Can't understand it,' said the officer coolly. 'All I know is that it is
      not the condemned man. He's quite a different character from this one; a
      gauntish fellow, with dark hair and eyes, rather good-looking, and with a
      musical bass voice that if you heard it once you'd never mistake as long
      as you lived.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, souls-'twas the man in the chimney-corner!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hey-what?' said the magistrate, coming forward after inquiring
      particulars from the shepherd in the background. 'Haven't you got the man
      after all?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, sir,' said the constable, 'he's the man we were in search of,
      that's true; and yet he's not the man we were in search of. For the man we
      were in search of was not the man we wanted, sir, if you understand my
      everyday way; for 'twas the man in the chimney-corner!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A pretty kettle of fish altogether!' said the magistrate. 'You had better
      start for the other man at once.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The prisoner now spoke for the first time. The mention of the man in the
      chimney-corner seemed to have moved him as nothing else could do. 'Sir,'
      he said, stepping forward to the magistrate, 'take no more trouble about
      me. The time is come when I may as well speak. I have done nothing; my
      crime is that the condemned man is my brother. Early this afternoon I left
      home at Shottsford to tramp it all the way to Casterbridge jail to bid him
      farewell. I was benighted, and called here to rest and ask the way. When I
      opened the door I saw before me the very man, my brother, that I thought
      to see in the condemned cell at Casterbridge. He was in this
      chimney-corner; and jammed close to him, so that he could not have got out
      if he had tried, was the executioner who'd come to take his life, singing
      a song about it and not knowing that it was his victim who was close by,
      joining in to save appearances. My brother looked a glance of agony at me,
      and I knew he meant, "Don't reveal what you see; my life depends on it." I
      was so terror-struck that I could hardly stand, and, not knowing what I
      did, I turned and hurried away.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The narrator's manner and tone had the stamp of truth, and his story made
      a great impression on all around. 'And do you know where your brother is
      at the present time?' asked the magistrate.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I do not. I have never seen him since I closed this door.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I can testify to that, for we've been between ye ever since,' said the
      constable.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Where does he think to fly to?-what is his occupation?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He's a watch-and-clock-maker, sir.'
    </p>
    <p>
      ''A said 'a was a wheelwright-a wicked rogue,' said the constable.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The wheels of clocks and watches he meant, no doubt,' said Shepherd
      Fennel. 'I thought his hands were palish for's trade.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, it appears to me that nothing can be gained by retaining this poor
      man in custody,' said the magistrate; 'your business lies with the other,
      unquestionably.'
    </p>
    <p>
      And so the little man was released off-hand; but he looked nothing the
      less sad on that account, it being beyond the power of magistrate or
      constable to raze out the written troubles in his brain, for they
      concerned another whom he regarded with more solicitude than himself. When
      this was done, and the man had gone his way, the night was found to be so
      far advanced that it was deemed useless to renew the search before the
      next morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day, accordingly, the quest for the clever sheep-stealer became
      general and keen, to all appearance at least. But the intended punishment
      was cruelly disproportioned to the transgression, and the sympathy of a
      great many country-folk in that district was strongly on the side of the
      fugitive. Moreover, his marvellous coolness and daring in hob-and-nobbing
      with the hangman, under the unprecedented circumstances of the shepherd's
      party, won their admiration. So that it may be questioned if all those who
      ostensibly made themselves so busy in exploring woods and fields and lanes
      were quite so thorough when it came to the private examination of their
      own lofts and outhouses. Stories were afloat of a mysterious figure being
      occasionally seen in some old overgrown trackway or other, remote from
      turnpike roads; but when a search was instituted in any of these suspected
      quarters nobody was found. Thus the days and weeks passed without tidings.
    </p>
    <p>
      In brief; the bass-voiced man of the chimney-corner was never recaptured.
      Some said that he went across the sea, others that he did not, but buried
      himself in the depths of a populous city. At any rate, the gentleman in
      cinder-gray never did his morning's work at Casterbridge, nor met anywhere
      at all, for business purposes, the genial comrade with whom he had passed
      an hour of relaxation in the lonely house on the coomb.
    </p>
    <p>
      The grass has long been green on the graves of Shepherd Fennel and his
      frugal wife; the guests who made up the christening party have mainly
      followed their entertainers to the tomb; the baby in whose honour they all
      had met is a matron in the sere and yellow leaf. But the arrival of the
      three strangers at the shepherd's that night, and the details connected
      therewith, is a story as well known as ever in the country about Higher
      Crowstairs.
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I-A LORN MILKMAID
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was an eighty-cow dairy, and the troop of milkers, regular and
      supernumerary, were all at work; for, though the time of year was as yet
      but early April, the feed lay entirely in water-meadows, and the cows were
      'in full pail.' The hour was about six in the evening, and three- fourths
      of the large, red, rectangular animals having been finished off, there was
      opportunity for a little conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He do bring home his bride to-morrow, I hear. They've come as far as
      Anglebury to-day.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice seemed to proceed from the belly of the cow called Cherry, but
      the speaker was a milking-woman, whose face was buried in the flank of
      that motionless beast.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hav' anybody seen her?' said another.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a negative response from the first. 'Though they say she's a
      rosy-cheeked, tisty-tosty little body enough,' she added; and as the
      milkmaid spoke she turned her face so that she could glance past her cow's
      tail to the other side of the barton, where a thin, fading woman of thirty
      milked somewhat apart from the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Years younger than he, they say,' continued the second, with also a
      glance of reflectiveness in the same direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How old do you call him, then?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Thirty or so.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'More like forty,' broke in an old milkman near, in a long white pinafore
      or 'wropper,' and with the brim of his hat tied down, so that he looked
      like a woman. ''A was born before our Great Weir was builded, and I hadn't
      man's wages when I laved water there.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The discussion waxed so warm that the purr of the milk-streams became
      jerky, till a voice from another cow's belly cried with authority, 'Now
      then, what the Turk do it matter to us about Farmer Lodge's age, or Farmer
      Lodge's new mis'ess? I shall have to pay him nine pound a year for the
      rent of every one of these milchers, whatever his age or hers. Get on with
      your work, or 'twill be dark afore we have done. The evening is pinking in
      a'ready.' This speaker was the dairyman himself; by whom the milkmaids and
      men were employed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing more was said publicly about Farmer Lodge's wedding, but the first
      woman murmured under her cow to her next neighbour, ''Tis hard for she,'
      signifying the thin worn milkmaid aforesaid.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no,' said the second. 'He ha'n't spoke to Rhoda Brook for years.'
    </p>
    <p>
      When the milking was done they washed their pails and hung them on a
      many-forked stand made of the peeled limb of an oak-tree, set upright in
      the earth, and resembling a colossal antlered horn. The majority then
      dispersed in various directions homeward. The thin woman who had not
      spoken was joined by a boy of twelve or thereabout, and the twain went
      away up the field also.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their course lay apart from that of the others, to a lonely spot high
      above the water-meads, and not far from the border of Egdon Heath, whose
      dark countenance was visible in the distance as they drew nigh to their
      home.
    </p>
    <p>
      'They've just been saying down in barton that your father brings his young
      wife home from Anglebury to-morrow,' the woman observed. 'I shall want to
      send you for a few things to market, and you'll be pretty sure to meet
      'em.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, mother,' said the boy. 'Is father married then?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes . . . You can give her a look, and tell me what's she's like, if you
      do see her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, mother.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If she's dark or fair, and if she's tall-as tall as I. And if she seems
      like a woman who has ever worked for a living, or one that has been always
      well off, and has never done anything, and shows marks of the lady on her,
      as I expect she do.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      They crept up the hill in the twilight, and entered the cottage. It was
      built of mud-walls, the surface of which had been washed by many rains
      into channels and depressions that left none of the original flat face
      visible; while here and there in the thatch above a rafter showed like a
      bone protruding through the skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was kneeling down in the chimney-corner, before two pieces of turf
      laid together with the heather inwards, blowing at the red-hot ashes with
      her breath till the turves flamed. The radiance lit her pale cheek, and
      made her dark eyes, that had once been handsome, seem handsome anew.
      'Yes,' she resumed, 'see if she is dark or fair, and if you can, notice if
      her hands be white; if not, see if they look as though she had ever done
      housework, or are milker's hands like mine.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy again promised, inattentively this time, his mother not observing
      that he was cutting a notch with his pocket-knife in the beech-backed
      chair.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II-THE YOUNG WIFE
    </h2>
    <p>
      The road from Anglebury to Holmstoke is in general level; but there is one
      place where a sharp ascent breaks its monotony. Farmers homeward- bound
      from the former market-town, who trot all the rest of the way, walk their
      horses up this short incline.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next evening, while the sun was yet bright, a handsome new gig, with a
      lemon-coloured body and red wheels, was spinning westward along the level
      highway at the heels of a powerful mare. The driver was a yeoman in the
      prime of life, cleanly shaven like an actor, his face being toned to that
      bluish-vermilion hue which so often graces a thriving farmer's features
      when returning home after successful dealings in the town. Beside him sat
      a woman, many years his junior-almost, indeed, a girl. Her face too was
      fresh in colour, but it was of a totally different quality-soft and
      evanescent, like the light under a heap of rose-petals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Few people travelled this way, for it was not a main road; and the long
      white riband of gravel that stretched before them was empty, save of one
      small scarce-moving speck, which presently resolved itself into the figure
      of boy, who was creeping on at a snail's pace, and continually looking
      behind him-the heavy bundle he carried being some excuse for, if not the
      reason of, his dilatoriness. When the bouncing gig-party slowed at the
      bottom of the incline above mentioned, the pedestrian was only a few yards
      in front. Supporting the large bundle by putting one hand on his hip, he
      turned and looked straight at the farmer's wife as though he would read
      her through and through, pacing along abreast of the horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The low sun was full in her face, rendering every feature, shade, and
      contour distinct, from the curve of her little nostril to the colour of
      her eyes. The farmer, though he seemed annoyed at the boy's persistent
      presence, did not order him to get out of the way; and thus the lad
      preceded them, his hard gaze never leaving her, till they reached the top
      of the ascent, when the farmer trotted on with relief in his
      lineaments-having taken no outward notice of the boy whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How that poor lad stared at me!' said the young wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, dear; I saw that he did.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He is one of the village, I suppose?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'One of the neighbourhood. I think he lives with his mother a mile or two
      off.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He knows who we are, no doubt?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O yes. You must expect to be stared at just at first, my pretty
      Gertrude.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I do,-though I think the poor boy may have looked at us in the hope we
      might relieve him of his heavy load, rather than from curiosity.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no,' said her husband off-handedly. 'These country lads will carry a
      hundredweight once they get it on their backs; besides his pack had more
      size than weight in it. Now, then, another mile and I shall be able to
      show you our house in the distance-if it is not too dark before we get
      there.' The wheels spun round, and particles flew from their periphery as
      before, till a white house of ample dimensions revealed itself, with
      farm-buildings and ricks at the back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the boy had quickened his pace, and turning up a by-lane some
      mile and half short of the white farmstead, ascended towards the leaner
      pastures, and so on to the cottage of his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had reached home after her day's milking at the outlying dairy, and
      was washing cabbage at the doorway in the declining light. 'Hold up the
      net a moment,' she said, without preface, as the boy came up.
    </p>
    <p>
      He flung down his bundle, held the edge of the cabbage-net, and as she
      filled its meshes with the dripping leaves she went on, 'Well, did you see
      her?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes; quite plain.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is she ladylike?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes; and more. A lady complete.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is she young?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, she's growed up, and her ways be quite a woman's.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of course. What colour is her hair and face?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Her hair is lightish, and her face as comely as a live doll's.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Her eyes, then, are not dark like mine?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No-of a bluish turn, and her mouth is very nice and red; and when she
      smiles, her teeth show white.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is she tall?' said the woman sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I couldn't see. She was sitting down.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then do you go to Holmstoke church to-morrow morning: she's sure to be
      there. Go early and notice her walking in, and come home and tell me if
      she's taller than I.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very well, mother. But why don't you go and see for yourself?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I go to see her! I wouldn't look up at her if she were to pass my window
      this instant. She was with Mr. Lodge, of course. What did he say or do?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Just the same as usual.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Took no notice of you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'None.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day the mother put a clean shirt on the boy, and started him off for
      Holmstoke church. He reached the ancient little pile when the door was
      just being opened, and he was the first to enter. Taking his seat by the
      font, he watched all the parishioners file in. The well-to-do Farmer Lodge
      came nearly last; and his young wife, who accompanied him, walked up the
      aisle with the shyness natural to a modest woman who had appeared thus for
      the first time. As all other eyes were fixed upon her, the youth's stare
      was not noticed now.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he reached home his mother said, 'Well?' before he had entered the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      'She is not tall. She is rather short,' he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah!' said his mother, with satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But she's very pretty-very. In fact, she's lovely.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The youthful freshness of the yeoman's wife had evidently made an
      impression even on the somewhat hard nature of the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's all I want to hear,' said his mother quickly. 'Now, spread the
      table-cloth. The hare you caught is very tender; but mind that nobody
      catches you.-You've never told me what sort of hands she had.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have never seen 'em. She never took off her gloves.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What did she wear this morning?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A white bonnet and a silver-coloured gownd. It whewed and whistled so
      loud when it rubbed against the pews that the lady coloured up more than
      ever for very shame at the noise, and pulled it in to keep it from
      touching; but when she pushed into her seat, it whewed more than ever. Mr.
      Lodge, he seemed pleased, and his waistcoat stuck out, and his great
      golden seals hung like a lord's; but she seemed to wish her noisy gownd
      anywhere but on her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not she! However, that will do now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      These descriptions of the newly-married couple were continued from time to
      time by the boy at his mother's request, after any chance encounter he had
      had with them. But Rhoda Brook, though she might easily have seen young
      Mrs. Lodge for herself by walking a couple of miles, would never attempt
      an excursion towards the quarter where the farmhouse lay. Neither did she,
      at the daily milking in the dairyman's yard on Lodge's outlying second
      farm, ever speak on the subject of the recent marriage. The dairyman, who
      rented the cows of Lodge, and knew perfectly the tall milkmaid's history,
      with manly kindliness always kept the gossip in the cow-barton from
      annoying Rhoda. But the atmosphere thereabout was full of the subject
      during the first days of Mrs. Lodge's arrival; and from her boy's
      description and the casual words of the other milkers, Rhoda Brook could
      raise a mental image of the unconscious Mrs Lodge that was realistic as a
      photograph.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III-A VISION
    </h2>
    <p>
      One night, two or three weeks after the bridal return, when the boy was
      gone to bed, Rhoda sat a long time over the turf ashes that she had raked
      out in front of her to extinguish them. She contemplated so intently the
      new wife, as presented to her in her mind's eye over the embers, that she
      forgot the lapse of time. At last, wearied with her day's work, she too
      retired.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the figure which had occupied her so much during this and the previous
      days was not to be banished at night. For the first time Gertrude Lodge
      visited the supplanted woman in her dreams. Rhoda Brook dreamed-since her
      assertion that she really saw, before falling asleep, was not to be
      believed-that the young wife, in the pale silk dress and white bonnet, but
      with features shockingly distorted, and wrinkled as by age, was sitting
      upon her chest as she lay. The pressure of Mrs. Lodge's person grew
      heavier; the blue eyes peered cruelly into her face; and then the figure
      thrust forward its left hand mockingly, so as to make the wedding-ring it
      wore glitter in Rhoda's eyes. Maddened mentally, and nearly suffocated by
      pressure, the sleeper struggled; the incubus, still regarding her,
      withdrew to the foot of the bed, only, however, to come forward by
      degrees, resume her seat, and flash her left hand as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gasping for breath, Rhoda, in a last desperate effort, swung out her right
      hand, seized the confronting spectre by its obtrusive left arm, and
      whirled it backward to the floor, starting up herself as she did so with a
      low cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, merciful heaven!' she cried, sitting on the edge of the bed in a cold
      sweat; 'that was not a dream-she was here!'
    </p>
    <p>
      She could feel her antagonist's arm within her grasp even now-the very
      flesh and bone of it, as it seemed. She looked on the floor whither she
      had whirled the spectre, but there was nothing to be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rhoda Brook slept no more that night, and when she went milking at the
      next dawn they noticed how pale and haggard she looked. The milk that she
      drew quivered into the pail; her hand had not calmed even yet, and still
      retained the feel of the arm. She came home to breakfast as wearily as if
      it had been suppertime.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What was that noise in your chimmer, mother, last night?' said her son.
      'You fell off the bed, surely?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Did you hear anything fall? At what time?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Just when the clock struck two.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not explain, and when the meal was done went silently about her
      household work, the boy assisting her, for he hated going afield on the
      farms, and she indulged his reluctance. Between eleven and twelve the
      garden-gate clicked, and she lifted her eyes to the window. At the bottom
      of the garden, within the gate, stood the woman of her vision. Rhoda
      seemed transfixed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, she said she would come!' exclaimed the boy, also observing her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Said so-when? How does she know us?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have seen and spoken to her. I talked to her yesterday.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I told you,' said the mother, flushing indignantly, 'never to speak to
      anybody in that house, or go near the place.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I did not speak to her till she spoke to me. And I did not go near the
      place. I met her in the road.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What did you tell her?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nothing. She said, "Are you the poor boy who had to bring the heavy load
      from market?" And she looked at my boots, and said they would not keep my
      feet dry if it came on wet, because they were so cracked. I told her I
      lived with my mother, and we had enough to do to keep ourselves, and
      that's how it was; and she said then, "I'll come and bring you some better
      boots, and see your mother." She gives away things to other folks in the
      meads besides us.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Lodge was by this time close to the door-not in her silk, as Rhoda
      had seen her in the bed-chamber, but in a morning hat, and gown of common
      light material, which became her better than silk. On her arm she carried
      a basket.
    </p>
    <p>
      The impression remaining from the night's experience was still strong.
      Brook had almost expected to see the wrinkles, the scorn, and the cruelty
      on her visitor's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      She would have escaped an interview, had escape been possible. There was,
      however, no backdoor to the cottage, and in an instant the boy had lifted
      the latch to Mrs. Lodge's gentle knock.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I see I have come to the right house,' said she, glancing at the lad, and
      smiling. 'But I was not sure till you opened the door.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The figure and action were those of the phantom; but her voice was so
      indescribably sweet, her glance so winning, her smile so tender, so unlike
      that of Rhoda's midnight visitant, that the latter could hardly believe
      the evidence of her senses. She was truly glad that she had not hidden
      away in sheer aversion, as she had been inclined to do. In her basket Mrs.
      Lodge brought the pair of boots that she had promised to the boy, and
      other useful articles.
    </p>
    <p>
      At these proofs of a kindly feeling towards her and hers Rhoda's heart
      reproached her bitterly. This innocent young thing should have her
      blessing and not her curse. When she left them a light seemed gone from
      the dwelling. Two days later she came again to know if the boots fitted;
      and less than a fortnight after that paid Rhoda another call. On this
      occasion the boy was absent.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I walk a good deal,' said Mrs. Lodge, 'and your house is the nearest
      outside our own parish. I hope you are well. You don't look quite well.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Rhoda said she was well enough; and, indeed, though the paler of the two,
      there was more of the strength that endures in her well-defined features
      and large frame, than in the soft-cheeked young woman before her. The
      conversation became quite confidential as regarded their powers and
      weaknesses; and when Mrs. Lodge was leaving, Rhoda said, 'I hope you will
      find this air agree with you, ma'am, and not suffer from the damp of the
      water-meads.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The younger one replied that there was not much doubt of it, her general
      health being usually good. 'Though, now you remind me,' she added, 'I have
      one little ailment which puzzles me. It is nothing serious, but I cannot
      make it out.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She uncovered her left hand and arm; and their outline confronted Rhoda's
      gaze as the exact original of the limb she had beheld and seized in her
      dream. Upon the pink round surface of the arm were faint marks of an
      unhealthy colour, as if produced by a rough grasp. Rhoda's eyes became
      riveted on the discolorations; she fancied that she discerned in them the
      shape of her own four fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How did it happen?' she said mechanically.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I cannot tell,' replied Mrs. Lodge, shaking her head. 'One night when I
      was sound asleep, dreaming I was away in some strange place, a pain
      suddenly shot into my arm there, and was so keen as to awaken me. I must
      have struck it in the daytime, I suppose, though I don't remember doing
      so.' She added, laughing, 'I tell my dear husband that it looks just as if
      he had flown into a rage and struck me there. O, I daresay it will soon
      disappear.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ha, ha! Yes . . . On what night did it come?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Lodge considered, and said it would be a fortnight ago on the morrow.
      'When I awoke I could not remember where I was,' she added, 'till the
      clock striking two reminded me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She had named the night and the hour of Rhoda's spectral encounter, and
      Brook felt like a guilty thing. The artless disclosure startled her; she
      did not reason on the freaks of coincidence; and all the scenery of that
      ghastly night returned with double vividness to her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, can it be,' she said to herself, when her visitor had departed, 'that
      I exercise a malignant power over people against my own will?' She knew
      that she had been slily called a witch since her fall; but never having
      understood why that particular stigma had been attached to her, it had
      passed disregarded. Could this be the explanation, and had such things as
      this ever happened before?

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV-A SUGGESTION
    </h2>
    <p>
      The summer drew on, and Rhoda Brook almost dreaded to meet Mrs. Lodge
      again, notwithstanding that her feeling for the young wife amounted
      well-nigh to affection. Something in her own individuality seemed to
      convict Rhoda of crime. Yet a fatality sometimes would direct the steps of
      the latter to the outskirts of Holmstoke whenever she left her house for
      any other purpose than her daily work; and hence it happened that their
      next encounter was out of doors. Rhoda could not avoid the subject which
      had so mystified her, and after the first few words she stammered, 'I hope
      your-arm is well again, ma'am?' She had perceived with consternation that
      Gertrude Lodge carried her left arm stiffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No; it is not quite well. Indeed it is no better at all; it is rather
      worse. It pains me dreadfully sometimes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Perhaps you had better go to a doctor, ma'am.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She replied that she had already seen a doctor. Her husband had insisted
      upon her going to one. But the surgeon had not seemed to understand the
      afflicted limb at all; he had told her to bathe it in hot water, and she
      had bathed it, but the treatment had done no good.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Will you let me see it?' said the milkwoman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Lodge pushed up her sleeve and disclosed the place, which was a few
      inches above the wrist. As soon as Rhoda Brook saw it, she could hardly
      preserve her composure. There was nothing of the nature of a wound, but
      the arm at that point had a shrivelled look, and the outline of the four
      fingers appeared more distinct than at the former time. Moreover, she
      fancied that they were imprinted in precisely the relative position of her
      clutch upon the arm in the trance; the first finger towards Gertrude's
      wrist, and the fourth towards her elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      What the impress resembled seemed to have struck Gertrude herself since
      their last meeting. 'It looks almost like finger-marks,' she said; adding
      with a faint laugh, 'my husband says it is as if some witch, or the devil
      himself, had taken hold of me there, and blasted the flesh.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Rhoda shivered. 'That's fancy,' she said hurriedly. 'I wouldn't mind it,
      if I were you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I shouldn't so much mind it,' said the younger, with hesitation, 'if-if I
      hadn't a notion that it makes my husband-dislike me-no, love me less. Men
      think so much of personal appearance.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Some do-he for one.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes; and he was very proud of mine, at first.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Keep your arm covered from his sight.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah-he knows the disfigurement is there!' She tried to hide the tears that
      filled her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, ma'am, I earnestly hope it will go away soon.'
    </p>
    <p>
      And so the milkwoman's mind was chained anew to the subject by a horrid
      sort of spell as she returned home. The sense of having been guilty of an
      act of malignity increased, affect as she might to ridicule her
      superstition. In her secret heart Rhoda did not altogether object to a
      slight diminution of her successor's beauty, by whatever means it had come
      about; but she did not wish to inflict upon her physical pain. For though
      this pretty young woman had rendered impossible any reparation which Lodge
      might have made Rhoda for his past conduct, everything like resentment at
      the unconscious usurpation had quite passed away from the elder's mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the sweet and kindly Gertrude Lodge only knew of the scene in the
      bed-chamber, what would she think? Not to inform her of it seemed
      treachery in the presence of her friendliness; but tell she could not of
      her own accord-neither could she devise a remedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      She mused upon the matter the greater part of the night; and the next day,
      after the morning milking, set out to obtain another glimpse of Gertrude
      Lodge if she could, being held to her by a gruesome fascination. By
      watching the house from a distance the milkmaid was presently able to
      discern the farmer's wife in a ride she was taking alone-probably to join
      her husband in some distant field. Mrs. Lodge perceived her, and cantered
      in her direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good morning, Rhoda!' Gertrude said, when she had come up. 'I was going
      to call.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Rhoda noticed that Mrs. Lodge held the reins with some difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I hope-the bad arm,' said Rhoda.
    </p>
    <p>
      'They tell me there is possibly one way by which I might be able to find
      out the cause, and so perhaps the cure, of it,' replied the other
      anxiously. 'It is by going to some clever man over in Egdon Heath. They
      did not know if he was still alive-and I cannot remember his name at this
      moment; but they said that you knew more of his movements than anybody
      else hereabout, and could tell me if he were still to be consulted. Dear
      me-what was his name? But you know.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not Conjuror Trendle?' said her thin companion, turning pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Trendle-yes. Is he alive?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I believe so,' said Rhoda, with reluctance.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why do you call him conjuror?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well-they say-they used to say he was a-he had powers other folks have
      not.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, how could my people be so superstitious as to recommend a man of that
      sort! I thought they meant some medical man. I shall think no more of
      him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Rhoda looked relieved, and Mrs. Lodge rode on. The milkwoman had inwardly
      seen, from the moment she heard of her having been mentioned as a
      reference for this man, that there must exist a sarcastic feeling among
      the work-folk that a sorceress would know the whereabouts of the exorcist.
      They suspected her, then. A short time ago this would have given no
      concern to a woman of her common-sense. But she had a haunting reason to
      be superstitious now; and she had been seized with sudden dread that this
      Conjuror Trendle might name her as the malignant influence which was
      blasting the fair person of Gertrude, and so lead her friend to hate her
      for ever, and to treat her as some fiend in human shape.
    </p>
    <p>
      But all was not over. Two days after, a shadow intruded into the
      window-pattern thrown on Rhoda Brook's floor by the afternoon sun. The
      woman opened the door at once, almost breathlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Are you alone?' said Gertrude. She seemed to be no less harassed and
      anxious than Brook herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' said Rhoda.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The place on my arm seems worse, and troubles me!' the young farmer's
      wife went on. 'It is so mysterious! I do hope it will not be an incurable
      wound. I have again been thinking of what they said about Conjuror
      Trendle. I don't really believe in such men, but I should not mind just
      visiting him, from curiosity-though on no account must my husband know. Is
      it far to where he lives?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes-five miles,' said Rhoda backwardly. 'In the heart of Egdon.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I should have to walk. Could not you go with me to show me the
      way-say to-morrow afternoon?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, not I-that is,' the milkwoman murmured, with a start of dismay. Again
      the dread seized her that something to do with her fierce act in the dream
      might be revealed, and her character in the eyes of the most useful friend
      she had ever had be ruined irretrievably.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Lodge urged, and Rhoda finally assented, though with much misgiving.
      Sad as the journey would be to her, she could not conscientiously stand in
      the way of a possible remedy for her patron's strange affliction. It was
      agreed that, to escape suspicion of their mystic intent, they should meet
      at the edge of the heath at the corner of a plantation which was visible
      from the spot where they now stood.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V-CONJUROR TRENDLE
    </h2>
    <p>
      By the next afternoon Rhoda would have done anything to escape this
      inquiry. But she had promised to go. Moreover, there was a horrid
      fascination at times in becoming instrumental in throwing such possible
      light on her own character as would reveal her to be something greater in
      the occult world than she had ever herself suspected.
    </p>
    <p>
      She started just before the time of day mentioned between them, and
      half-an-hour's brisk walking brought her to the south-eastern extension of
      the Egdon tract of country, where the fir plantation was. A slight figure,
      cloaked and veiled, was already there. Rhoda recognized, almost with a
      shudder, that Mrs. Lodge bore her left arm in a sling.
    </p>
    <p>
      They hardly spoke to each other, and immediately set out on their climb
      into the interior of this solemn country, which stood high above the rich
      alluvial soil they had left half-an-hour before. It was a long walk; thick
      clouds made the atmosphere dark, though it was as yet only early
      afternoon; and the wind howled dismally over the hills of the heath-not
      improbably the same heath which had witnessed the agony of the Wessex King
      Ina, presented to after-ages as Lear. Gertrude Lodge talked most, Rhoda
      replying with monosyllabic preoccupation. She had a strange dislike to
      walking on the side of her companion where hung the afflicted arm, moving
      round to the other when inadvertently near it. Much heather had been
      brushed by their feet when they descended upon a cart-track, beside which
      stood the house of the man they sought.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not profess his remedial practices openly, or care anything about
      their continuance, his direct interests being those of a dealer in furze,
      turf, 'sharp sand,' and other local products. Indeed, he affected not to
      believe largely in his own powers, and when warts that had been shown him
      for cure miraculously disappeared-which it must be owned they infallibly
      did-he would say lightly, 'O, I only drink a glass of grog upon
      'em-perhaps it's all chance,' and immediately turn the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was at home when they arrived, having in fact seen them descending into
      his valley. He was a gray-bearded man, with a reddish face, and he looked
      singularly at Rhoda the first moment he beheld her. Mrs. Lodge told him
      her errand; and then with words of self-disparagement he examined her arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Medicine can't cure it,' he said promptly. ''Tis the work of an enemy.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Rhoda shrank into herself, and drew back.
    </p>
    <p>
      'An enemy? What enemy?' asked Mrs. Lodge.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head. 'That's best known to yourself,' he said. 'If you like,
      I can show the person to you, though I shall not myself know who it is. I
      can do no more; and don't wish to do that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She pressed him; on which he told Rhoda to wait outside where she stood,
      and took Mrs. Lodge into the room. It opened immediately from the door;
      and, as the latter remained ajar, Rhoda Brook could see the proceedings
      without taking part in them. He brought a tumbler from the dresser, nearly
      filled it with water, and fetching an egg, prepared it in some private
      way; after which he broke it on the edge of the glass, so that the white
      went in and the yolk remained. As it was getting gloomy, he took the glass
      and its contents to the window, and told Gertrude to watch them closely.
      They leant over the table together, and the milkwoman could see the
      opaline hue of the egg-fluid changing form as it sank in the water, but
      she was not near enough to define the shape that it assumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you catch the likeness of any face or figure as you look?' demanded
      the conjuror of the young woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      She murmured a reply, in tones so low as to be inaudible to Rhoda, and
      continued to gaze intently into the glass. Rhoda turned, and walked a few
      steps away.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mrs. Lodge came out, and her face was met by the light, it appeared
      exceedingly pale-as pale as Rhoda's-against the sad dun shades of the
      upland's garniture. Trendle shut the door behind her, and they at once
      started homeward together. But Rhoda perceived that her companion had
      quite changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Did he charge much?' she asked tentatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no-nothing. He would not take a farthing,' said Gertrude.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And what did you see?' inquired Rhoda.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nothing I-care to speak of.' The constraint in her manner was remarkable;
      her face was so rigid as to wear an oldened aspect, faintly suggestive of
      the face in Rhoda's bed-chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Was it you who first proposed coming here?' Mrs. Lodge suddenly inquired,
      after a long pause. 'How very odd, if you did!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No. But I am not sorry we have come, all things considered,' she replied.
      For the first time a sense of triumph possessed her, and she did not
      altogether deplore that the young thing at her side should learn that
      their lives had been antagonized by other influences than their own.
    </p>
    <p>
      The subject was no more alluded to during the long and dreary walk home.
      But in some way or other a story was whispered about the many-dairied
      lowland that winter that Mrs. Lodge's gradual loss of the use of her left
      arm was owing to her being 'overlooked' by Rhoda Brook. The latter kept
      her own counsel about the incubus, but her face grew sadder and thinner;
      and in the spring she and her boy disappeared from the neighbourhood of
      Holmstoke.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI-A SECOND ATTEMPT
    </h2>
    <p>
      Half-a-dozen years passed away, and Mr. and Mrs. Lodge's married
      experience sank into prosiness, and worse. The farmer was usually gloomy
      and silent: the woman whom he had wooed for her grace and beauty was
      contorted and disfigured in the left limb; moreover, she had brought him
      no child, which rendered it likely that he would be the last of a family
      who had occupied that valley for some two hundred years. He thought of
      Rhoda Brook and her son; and feared this might be a judgment from heaven
      upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The once blithe-hearted and enlightened Gertrude was changing into an
      irritable, superstitious woman, whose whole time was given to
      experimenting upon her ailment with every quack remedy she came across.
      She was honestly attached to her husband, and was ever secretly hoping
      against hope to win back his heart again by regaining some at least of her
      personal beauty. Hence it arose that her closet was lined with bottles,
      packets, and ointment-pots of every description-nay, bunches of mystic
      herbs, charms, and books of necromancy, which in her schoolgirl time she
      would have ridiculed as folly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Damned if you won't poison yourself with these apothecary messes and
      witch mixtures some time or other,' said her husband, when his eye chanced
      to fall upon the multitudinous array.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not reply, but turned her sad, soft glance upon him in such
      heart-swollen reproach that he looked sorry for his words, and added, 'I
      only meant it for your good, you know, Gertrude.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll clear out the whole lot, and destroy them,' said she huskily, 'and
      try such remedies no more!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You want somebody to cheer you,' he observed. 'I once thought of adopting
      a boy; but he is too old now. And he is gone away I don't know where.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She guessed to whom he alluded; for Rhoda Brook's story had in the course
      of years become known to her; though not a word had ever passed between
      her husband and herself on the subject. Neither had she ever spoken to him
      of her visit to Conjuror Trendle, and of what was revealed to her, or she
      thought was revealed to her, by that solitary heath-man.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was now five-and-twenty; but she seemed older.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Six years of marriage, and only a few months of love,' she sometimes
      whispered to herself. And then she thought of the apparent cause, and
      said, with a tragic glance at her withering limb, 'If I could only again
      be as I was when he first saw me!'
    </p>
    <p>
      She obediently destroyed her nostrums and charms; but there remained a
      hankering wish to try something else-some other sort of cure altogether.
      She had never revisited Trendle since she had been conducted to the house
      of the solitary by Rhoda against her will; but it now suddenly occurred to
      Gertrude that she would, in a last desperate effort at deliverance from
      this seeming curse, again seek out the man, if he yet lived. He was
      entitled to a certain credence, for the indistinct form he had raised in
      the glass had undoubtedly resembled the only woman in the world who-as she
      now knew, though not then-could have a reason for bearing her ill-will.
      The visit should be paid.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time she went alone, though she nearly got lost on the heath, and
      roamed a considerable distance out of her way. Trendle's house was reached
      at last, however: he was not indoors, and instead of waiting at the
      cottage, she went to where his bent figure was pointed out to her at work
      a long way off. Trendle remembered her, and laying down the handful of
      furze-roots which he was gathering and throwing into a heap, he offered to
      accompany her in her homeward direction, as the distance was considerable
      and the days were short. So they walked together, his head bowed nearly to
      the earth, and his form of a colour with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You can send away warts and other excrescences I know,' she said; 'why
      can't you send away this?' And the arm was uncovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You think too much of my powers!' said Trendle; 'and I am old and weak
      now, too. No, no; it is too much for me to attempt in my own person. What
      have ye tried?'
    </p>
    <p>
      She named to him some of the hundred medicaments and counterspells which
      she had adopted from time to time. He shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Some were good enough,' he said approvingly; 'but not many of them for
      such as this. This is of the nature of a blight, not of the nature of a
      wound; and if you ever do throw it off; it will be all at once.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If I only could!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'There is only one chance of doing it known to me. It has never failed in
      kindred afflictions,-that I can declare. But it is hard to carry out, and
      especially for a woman.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Tell me!' said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You must touch with the limb the neck of a man who's been hanged.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She started a little at the image he had raised.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Before he's cold-just after he's cut down,' continued the conjuror
      impassively.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How can that do good?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It will turn the blood and change the constitution. But, as I say, to do
      it is hard. You must get into jail, and wait for him when he's brought off
      the gallows. Lots have done it, though perhaps not such pretty women as
      you. I used to send dozens for skin complaints. But that was in former
      times. The last I sent was in '13-near twenty years ago.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He had no more to tell her; and, when he had put her into a straight track
      homeward, turned and left her, refusing all money as at first.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII-A RIDE
    </h2>
    <p>
      The communication sank deep into Gertrude's mind. Her nature was rather a
      timid one; and probably of all remedies that the white wizard could have
      suggested there was not one which would have filled her with so much
      aversion as this, not to speak of the immense obstacles in the way of its
      adoption.
    </p>
    <p>
      Casterbridge, the county-town, was a dozen or fifteen miles off; and
      though in those days, when men were executed for horse-stealing, arson,
      and burglary, an assize seldom passed without a hanging, it was not likely
      that she could get access to the body of the criminal unaided. And the
      fear of her husband's anger made her reluctant to breathe a word of
      Trendle's suggestion to him or to anybody about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did nothing for months, and patiently bore her disfigurement as
      before. But her woman's nature, craving for renewed love, through the
      medium of renewed beauty (she was but twenty-five), was ever stimulating
      her to try what, at any rate, could hardly do her any harm. 'What came by
      a spell will go by a spell surely,' she would say. Whenever her
      imagination pictured the act she shrank in terror from the possibility of
      it: then the words of the conjuror, 'It will turn your blood,' were seen
      to be capable of a scientific no less than a ghastly interpretation; the
      mastering desire returned, and urged her on again.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was at this time but one county paper, and that her husband only
      occasionally borrowed. But old-fashioned days had old-fashioned means, and
      news was extensively conveyed by word of mouth from market to market, or
      from fair to fair, so that, whenever such an event as an execution was
      about to take place, few within a radius of twenty miles were ignorant of
      the coming sight; and, so far as Holmstoke was concerned, some enthusiasts
      had been known to walk all the way to Casterbridge and back in one day,
      solely to witness the spectacle. The next assizes were in March; and when
      Gertrude Lodge heard that they had been held, she inquired stealthily at
      the inn as to the result, as soon as she could find opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was, however, too late. The time at which the sentences were to be
      carried out had arrived, and to make the journey and obtain admission at
      such short notice required at least her husband's assistance. She dared
      not tell him, for she had found by delicate experiment that these
      smouldering village beliefs made him furious if mentioned, partly because
      he half entertained them himself. It was therefore necessary to wait for
      another opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her determination received a fillip from learning that two epileptic
      children had attended from this very village of Holmstoke many years
      before with beneficial results, though the experiment had been strongly
      condemned by the neighbouring clergy. April, May, June, passed; and it is
      no overstatement to say that by the end of the last-named month Gertrude
      well-nigh longed for the death of a fellow-creature. Instead of her formal
      prayers each night, her unconscious prayer was, 'O Lord, hang some guilty
      or innocent person soon!'
    </p>
    <p>
      This time she made earlier inquiries, and was altogether more systematic
      in her proceedings. Moreover, the season was summer, between the haymaking
      and the harvest, and in the leisure thus afforded him her husband had been
      holiday-taking away from home.
    </p>
    <p>
      The assizes were in July, and she went to the inn as before. There was to
      be one execution-only one-for arson.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her greatest problem was not how to get to Casterbridge, but what means
      she should adopt for obtaining admission to the jail. Though access for
      such purposes had formerly never been denied, the custom had fallen into
      desuetude; and in contemplating her possible difficulties, she was again
      almost driven to fall back upon her husband. But, on sounding him about
      the assizes, he was so uncommunicative, so more than usually cold, that
      she did not proceed, and decided that whatever she did she would do alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortune, obdurate hitherto, showed her unexpected favour. On the Thursday
      before the Saturday fixed for the execution, Lodge remarked to her that he
      was going away from home for another day or two on business at a fair, and
      that he was sorry he could not take her with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She exhibited on this occasion so much readiness to stay at home that he
      looked at her in surprise. Time had been when she would have shown deep
      disappointment at the loss of such a jaunt. However, he lapsed into his
      usual taciturnity, and on the day named left Holmstoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now her turn. She at first had thought of driving, but on
      reflection held that driving would not do, since it would necessitate her
      keeping to the turnpike-road, and so increase by tenfold the risk of her
      ghastly errand being found out. She decided to ride, and avoid the beaten
      track, notwithstanding that in her husband's stables there was no animal
      just at present which by any stretch of imagination could be considered a
      lady's mount, in spite of his promise before marriage to always keep a
      mare for her. He had, however, many cart-horses, fine ones of their kind;
      and among the rest was a serviceable creature, an equine Amazon, with a
      back as broad as a sofa, on which Gertrude had occasionally taken an
      airing when unwell. This horse she chose.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Friday afternoon one of the men brought it round. She was dressed, and
      before going down looked at her shrivelled arm. 'Ah!' she said to it, 'if
      it had not been for you this terrible ordeal would have been saved me!'
    </p>
    <p>
      When strapping up the bundle in which she carried a few articles of
      clothing, she took occasion to say to the servant, 'I take these in case I
      should not get back to-night from the person I am going to visit. Don't be
      alarmed if I am not in by ten, and close up the house as usual. I shall be
      at home to-morrow for certain.' She meant then to privately tell her
      husband: the deed accomplished was not like the deed projected. He would
      almost certainly forgive her.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then the pretty palpitating Gertrude Lodge went from her husband's
      homestead; but though her goal was Casterbridge she did not take the
      direct route thither through Stickleford. Her cunning course at first was
      in precisely the opposite direction. As soon as she was out of sight,
      however, she turned to the left, by a road which led into Egdon, and on
      entering the heath wheeled round, and set out in the true course, due
      westerly. A more private way down the county could not be imagined; and as
      to direction, she had merely to keep her horse's head to a point a little
      to the right of the sun. She knew that she would light upon a furze-cutter
      or cottager of some sort from time to time, from whom she might correct
      her bearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though the date was comparatively recent, Egdon was much less fragmentary
      in character than now. The attempts-successful and otherwise-at
      cultivation on the lower slopes, which intrude and break up the original
      heath into small detached heaths, had not been carried far; Enclosure Acts
      had not taken effect, and the banks and fences which now exclude the
      cattle of those villagers who formerly enjoyed rights of commonage
      thereon, and the carts of those who had turbary privileges which kept them
      in firing all the year round, were not erected. Gertrude, therefore, rode
      along with no other obstacles than the prickly furze bushes, the mats of
      heather, the white water-courses, and the natural steeps and declivities
      of the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her horse was sure, if heavy-footed and slow, and though a draught animal,
      was easy-paced; had it been otherwise, she was not a woman who could have
      ventured to ride over such a bit of country with a half-dead arm. It was
      therefore nearly eight o'clock when she drew rein to breathe the mare on
      the last outlying high point of heath-land towards Casterbridge, previous
      to leaving Egdon for the cultivated valleys.
    </p>
    <p>
      She halted before a pool called Rushy-pond, flanked by the ends of two
      hedges; a railing ran through the centre of the pond, dividing it in half.
      Over the railing she saw the low green country; over the green trees the
      roofs of the town; over the roofs a white flat facade, denoting the
      entrance to the county jail. On the roof of this front specks were moving
      about; they seemed to be workmen erecting something. Her flesh crept. She
      descended slowly, and was soon amid corn-fields and pastures. In another
      half-hour, when it was almost dusk, Gertrude reached the White Hart, the
      first inn of the town on that side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little surprise was excited by her arrival; farmers' wives rode on
      horseback then more than they do now; though, for that matter, Mrs. Lodge
      was not imagined to be a wife at all; the innkeeper supposed her some
      harum-skarum young woman who had come to attend 'hang-fair' next day.
      Neither her husband nor herself ever dealt in Casterbridge market, so that
      she was unknown. While dismounting she beheld a crowd of boys standing at
      the door of a harness-maker's shop just above the inn, looking inside it
      with deep interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What is going on there?' she asked of the ostler.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Making the rope for to-morrow.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She throbbed responsively, and contracted her arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      ''Tis sold by the inch afterwards,' the man continued. 'I could get you a
      bit, miss, for nothing, if you'd like?'
    </p>
    <p>
      She hastily repudiated any such wish, all the more from a curious creeping
      feeling that the condemned wretch's destiny was becoming interwoven with
      her own; and having engaged a room for the night, sat down to think.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up to this time she had formed but the vaguest notions about her means of
      obtaining access to the prison. The words of the cunning-man returned to
      her mind. He had implied that she should use her beauty, impaired though
      it was, as a pass-key. In her inexperience she knew little about jail
      functionaries; she had heard of a high-sheriff and an under-sheriff; but
      dimly only. She knew, however, that there must be a hangman, and to the
      hangman she determined to apply.

    <h2>
      VIII-A WATER-SIDE HERMIT
    </h2>
    <p>
      At this date, and for several years after, there was a hangman to almost
      every jail. Gertrude found, on inquiry, that the Casterbridge official
      dwelt in a lonely cottage by a deep slow river flowing under the cliff on
      which the prison buildings were situate-the stream being the self- same
      one, though she did not know it, which watered the Stickleford and
      Holmstoke meads lower down in its course.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having changed her dress, and before she had eaten or drunk-for she could
      not take her ease till she had ascertained some particulars-Gertrude
      pursued her way by a path along the water-side to the cottage indicated.
      Passing thus the outskirts of the jail, she discerned on the level roof
      over the gateway three rectangular lines against the sky, where the specks
      had been moving in her distant view; she recognized what the erection was,
      and passed quickly on. Another hundred yards brought her to the
      executioner's house, which a boy pointed out It stood close to the same
      stream, and was hard by a weir, the waters of which emitted a steady roar.
    </p>
    <p>
      While she stood hesitating the door opened, and an old man came forth
      shading a candle with one hand. Locking the door on the outside, he turned
      to a flight of wooden steps fixed against the end of the cottage, and
      began to ascend them, this being evidently the staircase to his bedroom.
      Gertrude hastened forward, but by the time she reached the foot of the
      ladder he was at the top. She called to him loudly enough to be heard
      above the roar of the weir; he looked down and said, 'What d'ye want
      here?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'To speak to you a minute.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The candle-light, such as it was, fell upon her imploring, pale, upturned
      face, and Davies (as the hangman was called) backed down the ladder. 'I
      was just going to bed,' he said; '"Early to bed and early to rise," but I
      don't mind stopping a minute for such a one as you. Come into house.' He
      reopened the door, and preceded her to the room within.
    </p>
    <p>
      The implements of his daily work, which was that of a jobbing gardener,
      stood in a corner, and seeing probably that she looked rural, he said, 'If
      you want me to undertake country work I can't come, for I never leave
      Casterbridge for gentle nor simple-not I. My real calling is officer of
      justice,' he added formally.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, yes! That's it. To-morrow!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah! I thought so. Well, what's the matter about that? 'Tis no use to come
      here about the knot-folks do come continually, but I tell 'em one knot is
      as merciful as another if ye keep it under the ear. Is the unfortunate man
      a relation; or, I should say, perhaps' (looking at her dress) 'a person
      who's been in your employ?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No. What time is the execution?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The same as usual-twelve o'clock, or as soon after as the London mail-
      coach gets in. We always wait for that, in case of a reprieve.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O-a reprieve-I hope not!' she said involuntarily,
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well,-hee, hee!-as a matter of business, so do I! But still, if ever a
      young fellow deserved to be let off, this one does; only just turned
      eighteen, and only present by chance when the rick was fired. Howsomever,
      there's not much risk of it, as they are obliged to make an example of
      him, there having been so much destruction of property that way lately.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I mean,' she explained, 'that I want to touch him for a charm, a cure of
      an affliction, by the advice of a man who has proved the virtue of the
      remedy.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O yes, miss! Now I understand. I've had such people come in past years.
      But it didn't strike me that you looked of a sort to require
      blood-turning. What's the complaint? The wrong kind for this, I'll be
      bound.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'My arm.' She reluctantly showed the withered skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah-'tis all a-scram!' said the hangman, examining it.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well,' he continued, with interest, 'that is the class o' subject, I'm
      bound to admit! I like the look of the place; it is truly as suitable for
      the cure as any I ever saw. 'Twas a knowing-man that sent 'ee, whoever he
      was.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You can contrive for me all that's necessary?' she said breathlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You should really have gone to the governor of the jail, and your doctor
      with 'ee, and given your name and address-that's how it used to be done,
      if I recollect. Still, perhaps, I can manage it for a trifling fee.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, thank you! I would rather do it this way, as I should like it kept
      private.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lover not to know, eh?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No-husband.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Aha! Very well. I'll get ee' a touch of the corpse.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Where is it now?' she said, shuddering.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It?-he, you mean; he's living yet. Just inside that little small winder
      up there in the glum.' He signified the jail on the cliff above.
    </p>
    <p>
      She thought of her husband and her friends. 'Yes, of course,' she said;
      'and how am I to proceed?'
    </p>
    <p>
      He took her to the door. 'Now, do you be waiting at the little wicket in
      the wall, that you'll find up there in the lane, not later than one
      o'clock. I will open it from the inside, as I shan't come home to dinner
      till he's cut down. Good-night. Be punctual; and if you don't want anybody
      to know 'ee, wear a veil. Ah-once I had such a daughter as you!'
    </p>
    <p>
      She went away, and climbed the path above, to assure herself that she
      would be able to find the wicket next day. Its outline was soon visible to
      her-a narrow opening in the outer wall of the prison precincts. The steep
      was so great that, having reached the wicket, she stopped a moment to
      breathe; and, looking back upon the water-side cot, saw the hangman again
      ascending his outdoor staircase. He entered the loft or chamber to which
      it led, and in a few minutes extinguished his light.
    </p>
    <p>
      The town clock struck ten, and she returned to the White Hart as she had
      come.

    <h2>
      IX-A RENCOUNTER
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was one o'clock on Saturday. Gertrude Lodge, having been admitted to
      the jail as above described, was sitting in a waiting-room within the
      second gate, which stood under a classic archway of ashlar, then
      comparatively modern, and bearing the inscription, 'COVNTY JAIL: 1793.'
      This had been the facade she saw from the heath the day before. Near at
      hand was a passage to the roof on which the gallows stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The town was thronged, and the market suspended; but Gertrude had seen
      scarcely a soul. Having kept her room till the hour of the appointment,
      she had proceeded to the spot by a way which avoided the open space below
      the cliff where the spectators had gathered; but she could, even now, hear
      the multitudinous babble of their voices, out of which rose at intervals
      the hoarse croak of a single voice uttering the words, 'Last dying speech
      and confession!' There had been no reprieve, and the execution was over;
      but the crowd still waited to see the body taken down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon the persistent girl heard a trampling overhead, then a hand beckoned
      to her, and, following directions, she went out and crossed the inner
      paved court beyond the gatehouse, her knees trembling so that she could
      scarcely walk. One of her arms was out of its sleeve, and only covered by
      her shawl.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the spot at which she had now arrived were two trestles, and before she
      could think of their purpose she heard heavy feet descending stairs
      somewhere at her back. Turn her head she would not, or could not, and,
      rigid in this position, she was conscious of a rough coffin passing her
      shoulder, borne by four men. It was open, and in it lay the body of a
      young man, wearing the smockfrock of a rustic, and fustian breeches. The
      corpse had been thrown into the coffin so hastily that the skirt of the
      smockfrock was hanging over. The burden was temporarily deposited on the
      trestles.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time the young woman's state was such that a gray mist seemed to
      float before her eyes, on account of which, and the veil she wore, she
      could scarcely discern anything: it was as though she had nearly died, but
      was held up by a sort of galvanism.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now!' said a voice close at hand, and she was just conscious that the
      word had been addressed to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      By a last strenuous effort she advanced, at the same time hearing persons
      approaching behind her. She bared her poor curst arm; and Davies,
      uncovering the face of the corpse, took Gertrude's hand, and held it so
      that her arm lay across the dead man's neck, upon a line the colour of an
      unripe blackberry, which surrounded it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gertrude shrieked: 'the turn o' the blood,' predicted by the conjuror, had
      taken place. But at that moment a second shriek rent the air of the
      enclosure: it was not Gertrude's, and its effect upon her was to make her
      start round.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately behind her stood Rhoda Brook, her face drawn, and her eyes red
      with weeping. Behind Rhoda stood Gertrude's own husband; his countenance
      lined, his eyes dim, but without a tear.
    </p>
    <p>
      'D-n you! what are you doing here?' he said hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hussy-to come between us and our child now!' cried Rhoda. 'This is the
      meaning of what Satan showed me in the vision! You are like her at last!'
      And clutching the bare arm of the younger woman, she pulled her
      unresistingly back against the wall. Immediately Brook had loosened her
      hold the fragile young Gertrude slid down against the feet of her husband.
      When he lifted her up she was unconscious.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mere sight of the twain had been enough to suggest to her that the
      dead young man was Rhoda's son. At that time the relatives of an executed
      convict had the privilege of claiming the body for burial, if they chose
      to do so; and it was for this purpose that Lodge was awaiting the inquest
      with Rhoda. He had been summoned by her as soon as the young man was taken
      in the crime, and at different times since; and he had attended in court
      during the trial. This was the 'holiday' he had been indulging in of late.
      The two wretched parents had wished to avoid exposure; and hence had come
      themselves for the body, a waggon and sheet for its conveyance and
      covering being in waiting outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gertrude's case was so serious that it was deemed advisable to call to her
      the surgeon who was at hand. She was taken out of the jail into the town;
      but she never reached home alive. Her delicate vitality, sapped perhaps by
      the paralyzed arm, collapsed under the double shock that followed the
      severe strain, physical and mental, to which she had subjected herself
      during the previous twenty-four hours. Her blood had been 'turned'
      indeed-too far. Her death took place in the town three days after.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband was never seen in Casterbridge again; once only in the old
      market-place at Anglebury, which he had so much frequented, and very
      seldom in public anywhere. Burdened at first with moodiness and remorse,
      he eventually changed for the better, and appeared as a chastened and
      thoughtful man. Soon after attending the funeral of his poor young wife he
      took steps towards giving up the farms in Holmstoke and the adjoining
      parish, and, having sold every head of his stock, he went away to
      Port-Bredy, at the other end of the county, living there in solitary
      lodgings till his death two years later of a painless decline. It was then
      found that he had bequeathed the whole of his not inconsiderable property
      to a reformatory for boys, subject to the payment of a small annuity to
      Rhoda Brook, if she could be found to claim it.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some time she could not be found; but eventually she reappeared in her
      old parish,-absolutely refusing, however, to have anything to do with the
      provision made for her. Her monotonous milking at the dairy was resumed,
      and followed for many long years, till her form became bent, and her once
      abundant dark hair white and worn away at the forehead-perhaps by long
      pressure against the cows. Here, sometimes, those who knew her experiences
      would stand and observe her, and wonder what sombre thoughts were beating
      inside that impassive, wrinkled brow, to the rhythm of the alternating
      milk-streams.

      The shepherd on the east hill could shout out lambing intelligence to the
      shepherd on the west hill, over the intervening town chimneys, without
      great inconvenience to his voice, so nearly did the steep pastures
      encroach upon the burghers' backyards. And at night it was possible to
      stand in the very midst of the town and hear from their native paddocks on
      the lower levels of greensward the mild lowing of the farmer's heifers,
      and the profound, warm blowings of breath in which those creatures
      indulge. But the community which had jammed itself in the valley thus
      flanked formed a veritable town, with a real mayor and corporation, and a
      staple manufacture.
    </p>
    <p>
      During a certain damp evening five-and-thirty years ago, before the
      twilight was far advanced, a pedestrian of professional appearance,
      carrying a small bag in his hand and an elevated umbrella, was descending
      one of these hills by the turnpike road when he was overtaken by a
      phaeton.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hullo, Downe-is that you?' said the driver of the vehicle, a young man of
      pale and refined appearance. 'Jump up here with me, and ride down to your
      door.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The other turned a plump, cheery, rather self-indulgent face over his
      shoulder towards the hailer.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, good evening, Mr. Barnet-thanks,' he said, and mounted beside his
      acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were fellow-burgesses of the town which lay beneath them, but though
      old and very good friends, they were differently circumstanced. Barnet was
      a richer man than the struggling young lawyer Downe, a fact which was to
      some extent perceptible in Downe's manner towards his companion, though
      nothing of it ever showed in Barnet's manner towards the solicitor.
      Barnet's position in the town was none of his own making; his father had
      been a very successful flax-merchant in the same place, where the trade
      was still carried on as briskly as the small capacities of its quarters
      would allow. Having acquired a fair fortune, old Mr. Barnet had retired
      from business, bringing up his son as a gentleman-burgher, and, it must be
      added, as a well-educated, liberal- minded young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How is Mrs. Barnet?' asked Downe.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mrs. Barnet was very well when I left home,' the other answered
      constrainedly, exchanging his meditative regard of the horse for one of
      self-consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Downe seemed to regret his inquiry, and immediately took up another
      thread of conversation. He congratulated his friend on his election as a
      council-man; he thought he had not seen him since that event took place;
      Mrs. Downe had meant to call and congratulate Mrs. Barnet, but he feared
      that she had failed to do so as yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barnet seemed hampered in his replies. 'We should have been glad to see
      you. I-my wife would welcome Mrs. Downe at any time, as you know . . .
      Yes, I am a member of the corporation-rather an inexperienced member, some
      of them say. It is quite true; and I should have declined the honour as
      premature-having other things on my hands just now, too-if it had not been
      pressed upon me so very heartily.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'There is one thing you have on your hands which I can never quite see the
      necessity for,' said Downe, with good-humoured freedom. 'What the deuce do
      you want to build that new mansion for, when you have already got such an
      excellent house as the one you live in?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Barnet's face acquired a warmer shade of colour; but as the question had
      been idly asked by the solicitor while regarding the surrounding flocks
      and fields, he answered after a moment with no apparent embarrassment -
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, we wanted to get out of the town, you know: the house I am living
      in is rather old and inconvenient.' Mr. Downe declared that he had chosen
      a pretty site for the new building. They would be able to see for miles
      and miles from the windows. Was he going to give it a name? He supposed
      so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barnet thought not. There was no other house near that was likely to be
      mistaken for it. And he did not care for a name.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But I think it has a name!' Downe observed: 'I went past-when was
      it?-this morning; and I saw something,-"Chateau Ringdale," I think it was,
      stuck up on a board!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It was an idea she-we had for a short time,' said Barnet hastily. 'But we
      have decided finally to do without a name-at any rate such a name as that.
      It must have been a week ago that you saw it. It was taken down last
      Saturday . . . Upon that matter I am firm!' he added grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Downe murmured in an unconvinced tone that he thought he had seen it
      yesterday.
    </p>
    <p>
      Talking thus they drove into the town. The street was unusually still for
      the hour of seven in the evening; an increasing drizzle had prevailed
      since the afternoon, and now formed a gauze across the yellow lamps, and
      trickled with a gentle rattle down the heavy roofs of stone tile, that
      bent the house-ridges hollow-backed with its weight, and in some instances
      caused the walls to bulge outwards in the upper story. Their route took
      them past the little town-hall, the Black-Bull Hotel, and onward to the
      junction of a small street on the right, consisting of a row of those
      two-and-two windowed brick residences of no particular age, which are
      exactly alike wherever found, except in the people they contain.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Wait-I'll drive you up to your door,' said Barnet, when Downe prepared to
      alight at the corner. He thereupon turned into the narrow street, when the
      faces of three little girls could be discerned close to the panes of a
      lighted window a few yards ahead, surmounted by that of a young matron,
      the gaze of all four being directed eagerly up the empty street. 'You are
      a fortunate fellow, Downe,' Barnet continued, as mother and children
      disappeared from the window to run to the door. 'You must be happy if any
      man is. I would give a hundred such houses as my new one to have a home
      like yours.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well-yes, we get along pretty comfortably,' replied Downe complacently.
    </p>
    <p>
      'That house, Downe, is none of my ordering,' Barnet broke out, revealing a
      bitterness hitherto suppressed, and checking the horse a moment to finish
      his speech before delivering up his passenger. 'The house I have already
      is good enough for me, as you supposed. It is my own freehold; it was
      built by my grandfather, and is stout enough for a castle. My father was
      born there, lived there, and died there. I was born there, and have always
      lived there; yet I must needs build a new one.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why do you?' said Downe.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why do I? To preserve peace in the household. I do anything for that; but
      I don't succeed. I was firm in resisting "Chateau Ringdale," however; not
      that I would not have put up with the absurdity of the name, but it was
      too much to have your house christened after Lord Ringdale, because your
      wife once had a fancy for him. If you only knew everything, you would
      think all attempt at reconciliation hopeless. In your happy home you have
      had no such experiences; and God forbid that you ever should. See, here
      they are all ready to receive you!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of course! And so will your wife be waiting to receive you,' said Downe.
      'Take my word for it she will! And with a dinner prepared for you far
      better than mine.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I hope so,' Barnet replied dubiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved on to Downe's door, which the solicitor's family had already
      opened. Downe descended, but being encumbered with his bag and umbrella,
      his foot slipped, and he fell upon his knees in the gutter.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, my dear Charles!' said his wife, running down the steps; and, quite
      ignoring the presence of Barnet, she seized hold of her husband, pulled
      him to his feet, and kissed him, exclaiming, 'I hope you are not hurt,
      darling!' The children crowded round, chiming in piteously, 'Poor papa!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He's all right,' said Barnet, perceiving that Downe was only a little
      muddy, and looking more at the wife than at the husband. Almost at any
      other time-certainly during his fastidious bachelor years-he would have
      thought her a too demonstrative woman; but those recent circumstances of
      his own life to which he had just alluded made Mrs. Downe's solicitude so
      affecting that his eye grew damp as he witnessed it. Bidding the lawyer
      and his family good-night he left them, and drove slowly into the main
      street towards his own house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The heart of Barnet was sufficiently impressionable to be influenced by
      Downe's parting prophecy that he might not be so unwelcome home as he
      imagined: the dreary night might, at least on this one occasion, make
      Downe's forecast true. Hence it was in a suspense that he could hardly
      have believed possible that he halted at his door. On entering his wife
      was nowhere to be seen, and he inquired for her. The servant informed him
      that her mistress had the dressmaker with her, and would be engaged for
      some time.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dressmaker at this time of day!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She dined early, sir, and hopes you will excuse her joining you this
      evening.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But she knew I was coming to-night?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O yes, sir.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Go up and tell her I am come.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant did so; but the mistress of the house merely transmitted her
      former words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barnet said nothing more, and presently sat down to his lonely meal, which
      was eaten abstractedly, the domestic scene he had lately witnessed still
      impressing him by its contrast with the situation here. His mind fell back
      into past years upon a certain pleasing and gentle being whose face would
      loom out of their shades at such times as these. Barnet turned in his
      chair, and looked with unfocused eyes in a direction southward from where
      he sat, as if he saw not the room but a long way beyond. 'I wonder if she
      lives there still!' he said.

    </h2>
    <p>
      He rose with a sudden rebelliousness, put on his hat and coat, and went
      out of the house, pursuing his way along the glistening pavement while
      eight o'clock was striking from St. Mary's tower, and the apprentices and
      shopmen were slamming up the shutters from end to end of the town. In two
      minutes only those shops which could boast of no attendant save the master
      or the mistress remained with open eyes. These were ever somewhat less
      prompt to exclude customers than the others: for their owners' ears the
      closing hour had scarcely the cheerfulness that it possessed for the hired
      servants of the rest. Yet the night being dreary the delay was not for
      long, and their windows, too, bWESSEXlinked together one by one.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this time Barnet had proceeded with decided step in a direction at
      right angles to the broad main thoroughfare of the town, by a long street
      leading due southward. Here, though his family had no more to do with the
      flax manufacture, his own name occasionally greeted him on gates and
      warehouses, being used allusively by small rising tradesmen as a
      recommendation, in such words as 'Smith, from Barnet &amp; Co.'-'Robinson,
      late manager at Barnet's.' The sight led him to reflect upon his father's
      busy life, and he questioned if it had not been far happier than his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      The houses along the road became fewer, and presently open ground appeared
      between them on either side, the track on the right hand rising to a
      higher level till it merged in a knoll. On the summit a row of builders'
      scaffold-poles probed the indistinct sky like spears, and at their bases
      could be discerned the lower courses of a building lately begun. Barnet
      slackened his pace and stood for a few moments without leaving the centre
      of the road, apparently not much interested in the sight, till suddenly
      his eye was caught by a post in the fore part of the ground bearing a
      white board at the top. He went to the rails, vaulted over, and walked in
      far enough to discern painted upon the board 'Chateau Ringdale.'
    </p>
    <p>
      A dismal irony seemed to lie in the words, and its effect was to irritate
      him. Downe, then, had spoken truly. He stuck his umbrella into the sod,
      and seized the post with both hands, as if intending to loosen and throw
      it down. Then, like one bewildered by an opposition which would exist none
      the less though its manifestations were removed, he allowed his arms to
      sink to his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Let it be,' he said to himself. 'I have declared there shall be peace-if
      possible.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking up his umbrella he quietly left the enclosure, and went on his way,
      still keeping his back to the town. He had advanced with more decision
      since passing the new building, and soon a hoarse murmur rose upon the
      gloom; it was the sound of the sea. The road led to the harbour, at a
      distance of a mile from the town, from which the trade of the district was
      fed. After seeing the obnoxious name-board Barnet had forgotten to open
      his umbrella, and the rain tapped smartly on his hat, and occasionally
      stroked his face as he went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though the lamps were still continued at the roadside, they stood at wider
      intervals than before, and the pavement had given place to common road.
      Every time he came to a lamp an increasing shine made itself visible upon
      his shoulders, till at last they quite glistened with wet. The murmur from
      the shore grew stronger, but it was still some distance off when he paused
      before one of the smallest of the detached houses by the wayside, standing
      in its own garden, the latter being divided from the road by a row of
      wooden palings. Scrutinizing the spot to ensure that he was not mistaken,
      he opened the gate and gently knocked at the cottage door.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had patiently waited minutes enough to lead any man in ordinary
      cases to knock again, the door was heard to open, though it was impossible
      to see by whose hand, there being no light in the passage. Barnet said at
      random, 'Does Miss Savile live here?'
    </p>
    <p>
      A youthful voice assured him that she did live there, and by a sudden
      afterthought asked him to come in. It would soon get a light, it said: but
      the night being wet, mother had not thought it worth while to trim the
      passage lamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't trouble yourself to get a light for me,' said Barnet hastily; 'it
      is not necessary at all. Which is Miss Savile's sitting-room?'
    </p>
    <p>
      The young person, whose white pinafore could just be discerned, signified
      a door in the side of the passage, and Barnet went forward at the same
      moment, so that no light should fall upon his face. On entering the room
      he closed the door behind him, pausing till he heard the retreating
      footsteps of the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found himself in an apartment which was simply and neatly, though not
      poorly furnished; everything, from the miniature chiffonnier to the
      shining little daguerreotype which formed the central ornament of the
      mantelpiece, being in scrupulous order. The picture was enclosed by a
      frame of embroidered card-board-evidently the work of feminine hands-and
      it was the portrait of a thin faced, elderly lieutenant in the navy. From
      behind the lamp on the table a female form now rose into view, that of a
      young girl, and a resemblance between her and the portrait was early
      discoverable. She had been so absorbed in some occupation on the other
      side of the lamp as to have barely found time to realize her visitor's
      presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      They both remained standing for a few seconds without speaking. The face
      that confronted Barnet had a beautiful outline; the Raffaelesque oval of
      its contour was remarkable for an English countenance, and that
      countenance housed in a remote country-road to an unheard-of harbour. But
      her features did not do justice to this splendid beginning: Nature had
      recollected that she was not in Italy; and the young lady's lineaments,
      though not so inconsistent as to make her plain, would have been accepted
      rather as pleasing than as correct. The preoccupied expression which, like
      images on the retina, remained with her for a moment after the state that
      caused it had ceased, now changed into a reserved, half-proud, and
      slightly indignant look, in which the blood diffused itself quickly across
      her cheek, and additional brightness broke the shade of her rather heavy
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I know I have no business here,' he said, answering the look. 'But I had
      a great wish to see you, and inquire how you were. You can give your hand
      to me, seeing how often I have held it in past days?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I would rather forget than remember all that, Mr. Barnet,' she answered,
      as she coldly complied with the request. 'When I think of the
      circumstances of our last meeting, I can hardly consider it kind of you to
      allude to such a thing as our past-or, indeed, to come here at all.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'There was no harm in it surely? I don't trouble you often, Lucy.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have not had the honour of a visit from you for a very long time,
      certainly, and I did not expect it now,' she said, with the same stiffness
      in her air. 'I hope Mrs. Barnet is very well?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, yes!' he impatiently returned. 'At least I suppose so-though I only
      speak from inference!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But she is your wife, sir,' said the young girl tremulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      The unwonted tones of a man's voice in that feminine chamber had startled
      a canary that was roosting in its cage by the window; the bird awoke
      hastily, and fluttered against the bars. She went and stilled it by laying
      her face against the cage and murmuring a coaxing sound. It might partly
      have been done to still herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I didn't come to talk of Mrs. Barnet,' he pursued; 'I came to talk of
      you, of yourself alone; to inquire how you are getting on since your great
      loss.' And he turned towards the portrait of her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am getting on fairly well, thank you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The force of her utterance was scarcely borne out by her look; but Barnet
      courteously reproached himself for not having guessed a thing so natural;
      and to dissipate all embarrassment, added, as he bent over the table,
      'What were you doing when I came?-painting flowers, and by candlelight?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no,' she said, 'not painting them-only sketching the outlines. I do
      that at night to save time-I have to get three dozen done by the end of
      the month.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Barnet looked as if he regretted it deeply. 'You will wear your poor eyes
      out,' he said, with more sentiment than he had hitherto shown. 'You ought
      not to do it. There was a time when I should have said you must not.
      Well-I almost wish I had never seen light with my own eyes when I think of
      that!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is this a time or place for recalling such matters?' she asked, with
      dignity. 'You used to have a gentlemanly respect for me, and for yourself.
      Don't speak any more as you have spoken, and don't come again. I cannot
      think that this visit is serious, or was closely considered by you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Considered: well, I came to see you as an old and good friend-not to
      mince matters, to visit a woman I loved. Don't be angry! I could not help
      doing it, so many things brought you into my mind . . . This evening I
      fell in with an acquaintance, and when I saw how happy he was with his
      wife and family welcoming him home, though with only one-tenth of my
      income and chances, and thought what might have been in my case, it fairly
      broke down my discretion, and off I came here. Now I am here I feel that I
      am wrong to some extent. But the feeling that I should like to see you,
      and talk of those we used to know in common, was very strong.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Before that can be the case a little more time must pass,' said Miss
      Savile quietly; 'a time long enough for me to regard with some calmness
      what at present I remember far too impatiently-though it may be you almost
      forget it. Indeed you must have forgotten it long before you acted as you
      did.' Her voice grew stronger and more vivacious as she added: 'But I am
      doing my best to forget it too, and I know I shall succeed from the
      progress I have made already!'
    </p>
    <p>
      She had remained standing till now, when she turned and sat down, facing
      half away from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barnet watched her moodily. 'Yes, it is only what I deserve,' he said.
      'Ambition pricked me on-no, it was not ambition, it was wrongheadedness!
      Had I but reflected . . . ' He broke out vehemently: 'But always remember
      this, Lucy: if you had written to me only one little line after that
      misunderstanding, I declare I should have come back to you. That ruined
      me!' he slowly walked as far as the little room would allow him to go, and
      remained with his eyes on the skirting.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But, Mr. Barnet, how could I write to you? There was no opening for my
      doing so.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then there ought to have been,' said Barnet, turning. 'That was my
      fault!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I don't know anything about that; but as there had been nothing
      said by me which required any explanation by letter, I did not send one.
      Everything was so indefinite, and feeling your position to be so much
      wealthier than mine, I fancied I might have mistaken your meaning. And
      when I heard of the other lady-a woman of whose family even you might be
      proud-I thought how foolish I had been, and said nothing.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then I suppose it was destiny-accident-I don't know what, that separated
      us, dear Lucy. Anyhow you were the woman I ought to have made my wife-and
      I let you slip, like the foolish man that I was!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, Mr. Barnet,' she said, almost in tears, 'don't revive the subject to
      me; I am the wrong one to console you-think, sir,-you should not be
      here-it would be so bad for me if it were known!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It would-it would, indeed,' he said hastily. 'I am not right in doing
      this, and I won't do it again.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is a very common folly of human nature, you know, to think the course
      you did not adopt must have been the best,' she continued, with gentle
      solicitude, as she followed him to the door of the room. 'And you don't
      know that I should have accepted you, even if you had asked me to be your
      wife.' At this his eye met hers, and she dropped her gaze. She knew that
      her voice belied her. There was a silence till she looked up to add, in a
      voice of soothing playfulness, 'My family was so much poorer than yours,
      even before I lost my dear father, that-perhaps your companions would have
      made it unpleasant for us on account of my deficiencies.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Your disposition would soon have won them round,' said Barnet.
    </p>
    <p>
      She archly expostulated: 'Now, never mind my disposition; try to make it
      up with your wife! Those are my commands to you. And now you are to leave
      me at once.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will. I must make the best of it all, I suppose,' he replied, more
      cheerfully than he had as yet spoken. 'But I shall never again meet with
      such a dear girl as you!' And he suddenly opened the door, and left her
      alone. When his glance again fell on the lamps that were sparsely ranged
      along the dreary level road, his eyes were in a state which showed
      straw-like motes of light radiating from each flame into the surrounding
      air.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other side of the way Barnet observed a man under an umbrella,
      walking parallel with himself. Presently this man left the footway, and
      gradually converged on Barnet's course. The latter then saw that it was
      Charlson, a surgeon of the town, who owed him money. Charlson was a man
      not without ability; yet he did not prosper. Sundry circumstances stood in
      his way as a medical practitioner: he was needy; he was not a coddle; he
      gossiped with men instead of with women; he had married a stranger instead
      of one of the town young ladies; and he was given to conversational
      buffoonery. Moreover, his look was quite erroneous. Those only proper
      features in the family doctor, the quiet eye, and the thin straight
      passionless lips which never curl in public either for laughter or for
      scorn, were not his; he had a full-curved mouth, and a bold black eye that
      made timid people nervous. His companions were what in old times would
      have been called boon companions-an expression which, though of
      irreproachable root, suggests fraternization carried to the point of
      unscrupulousness. All this was against him in the little town of his
      adoption.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charlson had been in difficulties, and to oblige him Barnet had put his
      name to a bill; and, as he had expected, was called upon to meet it when
      it fell due. It had been only a matter of fifty pounds, which Barnet could
      well afford to lose, and he bore no ill-will to the thriftless surgeon on
      account of it. But Charlson had a little too much brazen indifferentism in
      his composition to be altogether a desirable acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I hope to be able to make that little bill-business right with you in the
      course of three weeks, Mr. Barnet,' said Charlson with hail-fellow
      friendliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barnet replied good-naturedly that there was no hurry.
    </p>
    <p>
      This particular three weeks had moved on in advance of Charlson's present
      with the precision of a shadow for some considerable time.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I've had a dream,' Charlson continued. Barnet knew from his tone that the
      surgeon was going to begin his characteristic nonsense, and did not
      encourage him. 'I've had a dream,' repeated Charlson, who required no
      encouragement. 'I dreamed that a gentleman, who has been very kind to me,
      married a haughty lady in haste, before he had quite forgotten a nice
      little girl he knew before, and that one wet evening, like the present, as
      I was walking up the harbour-road, I saw him come out of that dear little
      girl's present abode.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Barnet glanced towards the speaker. The rays from a neighbouring lamp
      struck through the drizzle under Charlson's umbrella, so as just to
      illumine his face against the shade behind, and show that his eye was
      turned up under the outer corner of its lid, whence it leered with impish
      jocoseness as he thrust his tongue into his cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Come,' said Barnet gravely, 'we'll have no more of that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, no-of course not,' Charlson hastily answered, seeing that his humour
      had carried him too far, as it had done many times before. He was profuse
      in his apologies, but Barnet did not reply. Of one thing he was
      certain-that scandal was a plant of quick root, and that he was bound to
      obey Lucy's injunction for Lucy's own sake.

    <p>
      He did so, to the letter; and though, as the crocus followed the snowdrop
      and the daffodil the crocus in Lucy's garden, the harbour-road was a not
      unpleasant place to walk in, Barnet's feet never trod its stones, much
      less approached her door. He avoided a saunter that way as he would have
      avoided a dangerous dram, and took his airings a long distance northward,
      among severely square and brown ploughed fields, where no other townsman
      came. Sometimes he went round by the lower lanes of the borough, where the
      rope-walks stretched in which his family formerly had share, and looked at
      the rope-makers walking backwards, overhung by apple-trees and bushes, and
      intruded on by cows and calves, as if trade had established itself there
      at considerable inconvenience to Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning, when the sun was so warm as to raise a steam from the
      south-eastern slopes of those flanking hills that looked so lovely above
      the old roofs, but made every low-chimneyed house in the town as smoky as
      Tophet, Barnet glanced from the windows of the town-council room for lack
      of interest in what was proceeding within. Several members of the
      corporation were present, but there was not much business doing, and in a
      few minutes Downe came leisurely across to him, saying that he seldom saw
      Barnet now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barnet owned that he was not often present.
    </p>
    <p>
      Downe looked at the crimson curtain which hung down beside the panes,
      reflecting its hot hues into their faces, and then out of the window. At
      that moment there passed along the street a tall commanding lady, in whom
      the solicitor recognized Barnet's wife. Barnet had done the same thing,
      and turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It will be all right some day,' said Downe, with cheering sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You have heard, then, of her last outbreak?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Downe depressed his cheerfulness to its very reverse in a moment. 'No, I
      have not heard of anything serious,' he said, with as long a face as one
      naturally round could be turned into at short notice. 'I only hear vague
      reports of such things.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You may think it will be all right,' said Barnet drily. 'But I have a
      different opinion . . . No, Downe, we must look the thing in the face. Not
      poppy nor mandragora-however, how are your wife and children?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Downe said that they were all well, thanks; they were out that morning
      somewhere; he was just looking to see if they were walking that way. Ah,
      there they were, just coming down the street; and Downe pointed to the
      figures of two children with a nursemaid, and a lady walking behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You will come out and speak to her?' he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not this morning. The fact is I don't care to speak to anybody just now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are too sensitive, Mr. Barnet. At school I remember you used to get
      as red as a rose if anybody uttered a word that hurt your feelings.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Barnet mused. 'Yes,' he admitted, 'there is a grain of truth in that. It
      is because of that I often try to make peace at home. Life would be
      tolerable then at any rate, even if not particularly bright.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have thought more than once of proposing a little plan to you,' said
      Downe with some hesitation. 'I don't know whether it will meet your views,
      but take it or leave it, as you choose. In fact, it was my wife who
      suggested it: that she would be very glad to call on Mrs. Barnet and get
      into her confidence. She seems to think that Mrs. Barnet is rather alone
      in the town, and without advisers. Her impression is that your wife will
      listen to reason. Emily has a wonderful way of winning the hearts of
      people of her own sex.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And of the other sex too, I think. She is a charming woman, and you were
      a lucky fellow to find her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, perhaps I was,' simpered Downe, trying to wear an aspect of being
      the last man in the world to feel pride. 'However, she will be likely to
      find out what ruffles Mrs. Barnet. Perhaps it is some misunderstanding,
      you know-something that she is too proud to ask you to explain, or some
      little thing in your conduct that irritates her because she does not fully
      comprehend you. The truth is, Emily would have been more ready to make
      advances if she had been quite sure of her fitness for Mrs. Barnet's
      society, who has of course been accustomed to London people of good
      position, which made Emily fearful of intruding.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Barnet expressed his warmest thanks for the well-intentioned proposition.
      There was reason in Mrs. Downe's fear-that he owned. 'But do let her
      call,' he said. 'There is no woman in England I would so soon trust on
      such an errand. I am afraid there will not be any brilliant result; still
      I shall take it as the kindest and nicest thing if she will try it, and
      not be frightened at a repulse.'
    </p>
    <p>
      When Barnet and Downe had parted, the former went to the Town Savings-
      Bank, of which he was a trustee, and endeavoured to forget his troubles in
      the contemplation of low sums of money, and figures in a network of red
      and blue lines. He sat and watched the working-people making their
      deposits, to which at intervals he signed his name. Before he left in the
      afternoon Downe put his head inside the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Emily has seen Mrs. Barnet,' he said, in a low voice. 'She has got Mrs.
      Barnet's promise to take her for a drive down to the shore to- morrow, if
      it is fine. Good afternoon!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Barnet shook Downe by the hand without speaking, and Downe went away.

    <h2>
      IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next day was as fine as the arrangement could possibly require. As the
      sun passed the meridian and declined westward, the tall shadows from the
      scaffold-poles of Barnet's rising residence streaked the ground as far as
      to the middle of the highway. Barnet himself was there inspecting the
      progress of the works for the first time during several weeks. A building
      in an old-fashioned town five-and-thirty years ago did not, as in the
      modern fashion, rise from the sod like a booth at a fair. The foundations
      and lower courses were put in and allowed to settle for many weeks before
      the superstructure was built up, and a whole summer of drying was hardly
      sufficient to do justice to the important issues involved. Barnet stood
      within a window-niche which had as yet received no frame, and thence
      looked down a slope into the road. The wheels of a chaise were heard, and
      then his handsome Xantippe, in the company of Mrs. Downe, drove past on
      their way to the shore. They were driving slowly; there was a pleasing
      light in Mrs. Downe's face, which seemed faintly to reflect itself upon
      the countenance of her companion-that politesse du coeur which was so
      natural to her having possibly begun already to work results. But whatever
      the situation, Barnet resolved not to interfere, or do anything to hazard
      the promise of the day. He might well afford to trust the issue to another
      when he could never direct it but to ill himself. His wife's clenched
      rein-hand in its lemon-coloured glove, her stiff erect figure, clad in
      velvet and lace, and her boldly-outlined face, passed on, exhibiting their
      owner as one fixed for ever above the level of her companion-socially by
      her early breeding, and materially by her higher cushion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barnet decided to allow them a proper time to themselves, and then stroll
      down to the shore and drive them home. After lingering on at the house for
      another hour he started with this intention. A few hundred yards below
      'Chateau Ringdale' stood the cottage in which the late lieutenant's
      daughter had her lodging. Barnet had not been so far that way for a long
      time, and as he approached the forbidden ground a curious warmth passed
      into him, which led him to perceive that, unless he were careful, he might
      have to fight the battle with himself about Lucy over again. A tenth of
      his present excuse would, however, have justified him in travelling by
      that road to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came opposite the dwelling, and turned his eyes for a momentary glance
      into the little garden that stretched from the palings to the door. Lucy
      was in the enclosure; she was walking and stooping to gather some flowers,
      possibly for the purpose of painting them, for she moved about quickly, as
      if anxious to save time. She did not see him; he might have passed
      unnoticed; but a sensation which was not in strict unison with his
      previous sentiments that day led him to pause in his walk and watch her.
      She went nimbly round and round the beds of anemones, tulips, jonquils,
      polyanthuses, and other old-fashioned flowers, looking a very charming
      figure in her half-mourning bonnet, and with an incomplete nosegay in her
      left hand. Raising herself to pull down a lilac blossom she observed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr. Barnet!' she said, innocently smiling. 'Why, I have been thinking of
      you many times since Mrs. Barnet went by in the pony-carriage, and now
      here you are!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, Lucy,' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she seemed to recall particulars of their last meeting, and he
      believed that she flushed, though it might have been only the fancy of his
      own supersensitivenesss.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am going to the harbour,' he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Are you?' Lucy remarked simply. 'A great many people begin to go there
      now the summer is drawing on.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face had come more into his view as she spoke, and he noticed how much
      thinner and paler it was than when he had seen it last. 'Lucy, how weary
      you look! tell me, can I help you?' he was going to cry out.-'If I do,' he
      thought, 'it will be the ruin of us both!' He merely said that the
      afternoon was fine, and went on his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he went a sudden blast of air came over the hill as if in contradiction
      to his words, and spoilt the previous quiet of the scene. The wind had
      already shifted violently, and now smelt of the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      The harbour-road soon began to justify its name. A gap appeared in the
      rampart of hills which shut out the sea, and on the left of the opening
      rose a vertical cliff, coloured a burning orange by the sunlight, the
      companion cliff on the right being livid in shade. Between these cliffs,
      like the Libyan bay which sheltered the shipwrecked Trojans, was a little
      haven, seemingly a beginning made by Nature herself of a perfect harbour,
      which appealed to the passer-by as only requiring a little human industry
      to finish it and make it famous, the ground on each side as far back as
      the daisied slopes that bounded the interior valley being a mere layer of
      blown sand. But the Port-Bredy burgesses a mile inland had, in the course
      of ten centuries, responded many times to that mute appeal, with the
      result that the tides had invariably choked up their works with sand and
      shingle as soon as completed. There were but few houses here: a rough
      pier, a few boats, some stores, an inn, a residence or two, a ketch
      unloading in the harbour, were the chief features of the settlement. On
      the open ground by the shore stood his wife's pony-carriage, empty, the
      boy in attendance holding the horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Barnet drew nearer, he saw an indigo-coloured spot moving swiftly
      along beneath the radiant base of the eastern cliff, which proved to be a
      man in a jersey, running with all his might. He held up his hand to
      Barnet, as it seemed, and they approached each other. The man was local,
      but a stranger to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What is it, my man?' said Barnet.
    </p>
    <p>
      'A terrible calamity!' the boatman hastily explained. Two ladies had been
      capsized in a boat-they were Mrs. Downe and Mrs. Barnet of the old town;
      they had driven down there that afternoon-they had alighted, and it was so
      fine, that, after walking about a little while, they had been tempted to
      go out for a short sail round the cliff. Just as they were putting in to
      the shore, the wind shifted with a sudden gust, the boat listed over, and
      it was thought they were both drowned. How it could have happened was
      beyond his mind to fathom, for John Green knew how to sail a boat as well
      as any man there.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Which is the way to the place?' said Barnet.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was just round the cliff.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Run to the carriage and tell the boy to bring it to the place as soon as
      you can. Then go to the Harbour Inn and tell them to ride to town for a
      doctor. Have they been got out of the water?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'One lady has.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Which?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mrs. Barnet. Mrs. Downe, it is feared, has fleeted out to sea.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Barnet ran on to that part of the shore which the cliff had hitherto
      obscured from his view, and there discerned, a long way ahead, a group of
      fishermen standing. As soon as he came up one or two recognized him, and,
      not liking to meet his eye, turned aside with misgiving. He went amidst
      them and saw a small sailing-boat lying draggled at the water's edge; and,
      on the sloping shingle beside it, a soaked and sandy woman's form in the
      velvet dress and yellow gloves of his wife.

    <h2>

    </h2>
    <p>
      All had been done that could be done. Mrs. Barnet was in her own house
      under medical hands, but the result was still uncertain. Barnet had acted
      as if devotion to his wife were the dominant passion of his existence.
      There had been much to decide-whether to attempt restoration of the
      apparently lifeless body as it lay on the shore-whether to carry her to
      the Harbour Inn-whether to drive with her at once to his own house. The
      first course, with no skilled help or appliances near at hand, had seemed
      hopeless. The second course would have occupied nearly as much time as a
      drive to the town, owing to the intervening ridges of shingle, and the
      necessity of crossing the harbour by boat to get to the house, added to
      which much time must have elapsed before a doctor could have arrived down
      there. By bringing her home in the carriage some precious moments had
      slipped by; but she had been laid in her own bed in seven minutes, a
      doctor called to her side, and every possible restorative brought to bear
      upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      At what a tearing pace he had driven up that road, through the yellow
      evening sunlight, the shadows flapping irksomely into his eyes as each
      wayside object rushed past between him and the west! Tired workmen with
      their baskets at their backs had turned on their homeward journey to
      wonder at his speed. Halfway between the shore and Port-Bredy town he had
      met Charlson, who had been the first surgeon to hear of the accident. He
      was accompanied by his assistant in a gig. Barnet had sent on the latter
      to the coast in case that Downe's poor wife should by that time have been
      reclaimed from the waves, and had brought Charlson back with him to the
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barnet's presence was not needed here, and he felt it to be his next duty
      to set off at once and find Downe, that no other than himself might break
      the news to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was quite sure that no chance had been lost for Mrs. Downe by his
      leaving the shore. By the time that Mrs. Barnet had been laid in the
      carriage, a much larger group had assembled to lend assistance in finding
      her friend, rendering his own help superfluous. But the duty of breaking
      the news was made doubly painful by the circumstance that the catastrophe
      which had befallen Mrs. Downe was solely the result of her own and her
      husband's loving-kindness towards himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found Downe in his office. When the solicitor comprehended the
      intelligence he turned pale, stood up, and remained for a moment perfectly
      still, as if bereft of his faculties; then his shoulders heaved, he pulled
      out his handkerchief and began to cry like a child. His sobs might have
      been heard in the next room. He seemed to have no idea of going to the
      shore, or of doing anything; but when Barnet took him gently by the hand
      and proposed to start at once, he quietly acquiesced, neither uttering any
      further word nor making any effort to repress his tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barnet accompanied him to the shore, where, finding that no trace had as
      yet been seen of Mrs. Downe, and that his stay would be of no avail, he
      left Downe with his friends and the young doctor, and once more hastened
      back to his own house.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the door he met Charlson. 'Well!' Barnet said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have just come down,' said the doctor; 'we have done everything, but
      without result. I sympathize with you in your bereavement.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Barnet did not much appreciate Charlson's sympathy, which sounded to his
      ears as something of a mockery from the lips of a man who knew what
      Charlson knew about their domestic relations. Indeed there seemed an odd
      spark in Charlson's full black eye as he said the words; but that might
      have been imaginary.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And, Mr. Barnet,' Charlson resumed, 'that little matter between us-I hope
      to settle it finally in three weeks at least.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never mind that now,' said Barnet abruptly. He directed the surgeon to go
      to the harbour in case his services might even now be necessary there: and
      himself entered the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servants were coming from his wife's chamber, looking helplessly at
      each other and at him. He passed them by and entered the room, where he
      stood mutely regarding the bed for a few minutes, after which he walked
      into his own dressing-room adjoining, and there paced up and down. In a
      minute or two he noticed what a strange and total silence had come over
      the upper part of the house; his own movements, muffled as they were by
      the carpet, seemed noisy, and his thoughts to disturb the air like
      articulate utterances. His eye glanced through the window. Far down the
      road to the harbour a roof detained his gaze: out of it rose a red
      chimney, and out of the red chimney a curl of smoke, as from a fire newly
      kindled. He had often seen such a sight before. In that house lived Lucy
      Savile; and the smoke was from the fire which was regularly lighted at
      this time to make her tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that he went back to the bedroom, and stood there some time
      regarding his wife's silent form. She was a woman some years older than
      himself, but had not by any means overpassed the maturity of good looks
      and vigour. Her passionate features, well-defined, firm, and statuesque in
      life, were doubly so now: her mouth and brow, beneath her purplish black
      hair, showed only too clearly that the turbulency of character which had
      made a bear-garden of his house had been no temporary phase of her
      existence. While he reflected, he suddenly said to himself, I wonder if
      all has been done?
    </p>
    <p>
      The thought was led up to by his having fancied that his wife's features
      lacked in its complete form the expression which he had been accustomed to
      associate with the faces of those whose spirits have fled for ever. The
      effacement of life was not so marked but that, entering uninformed, he
      might have supposed her sleeping. Her complexion was that seen in the
      numerous faded portraits by Sir Joshua Reynolds; it was pallid in
      comparison with life, but there was visible on a close inspection the
      remnant of what had once been a flush; the keeping between the cheeks and
      the hollows of the face being thus preserved, although positive colour was
      gone. Long orange rays of evening sun stole in through chinks in the
      blind, striking on the large mirror, and being thence reflected upon the
      crimson hangings and woodwork of the heavy bedstead, so that the general
      tone of light was remarkably warm; and it was probable that something
      might be due to this circumstance. Still the fact impressed him as
      strange. Charlson had been gone more than a quarter of an hour: could it
      be possible that he had left too soon, and that his attempts to restore
      her had operated so sluggishly as only now to have made themselves felt?
      Barnet laid his hand upon her chest, and fancied that ever and anon a
      faint flutter of palpitation, gentle as that of a butterfly's wing,
      disturbed the stillness there-ceasing for a time, then struggling to go
      on, then breaking down in weakness and ceasing again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barnet's mother had been an active practitioner of the healing art among
      her poorer neighbours, and her inspirations had all been derived from an
      octavo volume of Domestic Medicine, which at this moment was lying, as it
      had lain for many years, on a shelf in Barnet's dressing-room. He hastily
      fetched it, and there read under the head 'Drowning:'-
    </p>
    <p>
      'Exertions for the recovery of any person who has not been immersed for a
      longer period than half-an-hour should be continued for at least four
      hours, as there have been many cases in which returning life has made
      itself visible even after a longer interval.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Should, however, a weak action of any of the organs show itself when the
      case seems almost hopeless, our efforts must be redoubled; the feeble
      spark in this case requires to be solicited; it will certainly disappear
      under a relaxation of labour.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Barnet looked at his watch; it was now barely two hours and a half from
      the time when he had first heard of the accident. He threw aside the book
      and turned quickly to reach a stimulant which had previously been used.
      Pulling up the blind for more light, his eye glanced out of the window.
      There he saw that red chimney still smoking cheerily, and that roof, and
      through the roof that somebody. His mechanical movements stopped, his hand
      remained on the blind-cord, and he seemed to become breathless, as if he
      had suddenly found himself treading a high rope.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he stood a sparrow lighted on the windowsill, saw him, and flew
      away. Next a man and a dog walked over one of the green hills which bulged
      above the roofs of the town. But Barnet took no notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may wonder what were the exact images that passed through his mind
      during those minutes of gazing upon Lucy Savile's house, the sparrow, the
      man and the dog, and Lucy Savile's house again. There are honest men who
      will not admit to their thoughts, even as idle hypotheses, views of the
      future that assume as done a deed which they would recoil from doing; and
      there are other honest men for whom morality ends at the surface of their
      own heads, who will deliberate what the first will not so much as suppose.
      Barnet had a wife whose pretence distracted his home; she now lay as in
      death; by merely doing nothing-by letting the intelligence which had gone
      forth to the world lie undisturbed-he would effect such a deliverance for
      himself as he had never hoped for, and open up an opportunity of which
      till now he had never dreamed. Whether the conjuncture had arisen through
      any unscrupulous, ill-considered impulse of Charlson to help out of a
      strait the friend who was so kind as never to press him for what was due
      could not be told; there was nothing to prove it; and it was a question
      which could never be asked. The triangular situation-himself-his wife-Lucy
      Savile-was the one clear thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      From Barnet's actions we may infer that he supposed such and such a
      result, for a moment, but did not deliberate. He withdrew his hazel eyes
      from the scene without, calmly turned, rang the bell for assistance, and
      vigorously exerted himself to learn if life still lingered in that
      motionless frame. In a short time another surgeon was in attendance; and
      then Barnet's surmise proved to be true. The slow life timidly heaved
      again; but much care and patience were needed to catch and retain it, and
      a considerable period elapsed before it could be said with certainty that
      Mrs. Barnet lived. When this was the case, and there was no further room
      for doubt, Barnet left the chamber. The blue evening smoke from Lucy's
      chimney had died down to an imperceptible stream, and as he walked about
      downstairs he murmured to himself, 'My wife was dead, and she is alive
      again.'
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not so with Downe. After three hours' immersion his wife's body had
      been recovered, life, of course, being quite extinct. Barnet on
      descending, went straight to his friend's house, and there learned the
      result. Downe was helpless in his wild grief, occasionally even
      hysterical. Barnet said little, but finding that some guiding hand was
      necessary in the sorrow-stricken household, took upon him to supervise and
      manage till Downe should be in a state of mind to do so for himself.

      VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      One September evening, four months later, when Mrs. Barnet was in perfect
      health, and Mrs. Downe but a weakening memory, an errand-boy paused to
      rest himself in front of Mr. Barnet's old house, depositing his basket on
      one of the window-sills. The street was not yet lighted, but there were
      lights in the house, and at intervals a flitting shadow fell upon the
      blind at his elbow. Words also were audible from the same apartment, and
      they seemed to be those of persons in violent altercation. But the boy
      could not gather their purport, and he went on his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes afterwards the door of Barnet's house opened, and a tall
      closely-veiled lady in a travelling-dress came out and descended the
      freestone steps. The servant stood in the doorway watching her as she went
      with a measured tread down the street. When she had been out of sight for
      some minutes Barnet appeared at the door from within.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Did your mistress leave word where she was going?' he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, sir.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is the carriage ordered to meet her anywhere?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, sir.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Did she take a latch-key?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, sir.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Barnet went in again, sat down in his chair, and leaned back. Then in
      solitude and silence he brooded over the bitter emotions that filled his
      heart. It was for this that he had gratuitously restored her to life, and
      made his union with another impossible! The evening drew on, and nobody
      came to disturb him. At bedtime he told the servants to retire, that he
      would sit up for Mrs. Barnet himself; and when they were gone he leaned
      his head upon his hand and mused for hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clock struck one, two; still his wife came not, and, with impatience
      added to depression, he went from room to room till another weary hour had
      passed. This was not altogether a new experience for Barnet; but she had
      never before so prolonged her absence. At last he sat down again and fell
      asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      He awoke at six o'clock to find that she had not returned. In searching
      about the rooms he discovered that she had taken a case of jewels which
      had been hers before her marriage. At eight a note was brought him; it was
      from his wife, in which she stated that she had gone by the coach to the
      house of a distant relative near London, and expressed a wish that certain
      boxes, articles of clothing, and so on, might be sent to her forthwith.
      The note was brought to him by a waiter at the Black-Bull Hotel, and had
      been written by Mrs. Barnet immediately before she took her place in the
      stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the evening this order was carried out, and Barnet, with a sense of
      relief, walked out into the town. A fair had been held during the day, and
      the large clear moon which rose over the most prominent hill flung its
      light upon the booths and standings that still remained in the street,
      mixing its rays curiously with those from the flaring naphtha lamps. The
      town was full of country-people who had come in to enjoy themselves, and
      on this account Barnet strolled through the streets unobserved. With a
      certain recklessness he made for the harbour-road, and presently found
      himself by the shore, where he walked on till he came to the spot near
      which his friend the kindly Mrs. Downe had lost her life, and his own
      wife's life had been preserved. A tremulous pathway of bright moonshine
      now stretched over the water which had engulfed them, and not a living
      soul was near.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here he ruminated on their characters, and next on the young girl in whom
      he now took a more sensitive interest than at the time when he had been
      free to marry her. Nothing, so far as he was aware, had ever appeared in
      his own conduct to show that such an interest existed. He had made it a
      point of the utmost strictness to hinder that feeling from influencing in
      the faintest degree his attitude towards his wife; and this was made all
      the more easy for him by the small demand Mrs. Barnet made upon his
      attentions, for which she ever evinced the greatest contempt; thus
      unwittingly giving him the satisfaction of knowing that their severance
      owed nothing to jealousy, or, indeed, to any personal behaviour of his at
      all. Her concern was not with him or his feelings, as she frequently told
      him; but that she had, in a moment of weakness, thrown herself away upon a
      common burgher when she might have aimed at, and possibly brought down, a
      peer of the realm. Her frequent depreciation of Barnet in these terms had
      at times been so intense that he was sorely tempted to retaliate on her
      egotism by owning that he loved at the same low level on which he lived;
      but prudence had prevailed, for which he was now thankful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something seemed to sound upon the shingle behind him over and above the
      raking of the wave. He looked round, and a slight girlish shape appeared
      quite close to him, He could not see her face because it was in the
      direction of the moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr. Barnet?' the rambler said, in timid surprise. The voice was the voice
      of Lucy Savile.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' said Barnet. 'How can I repay you for this pleasure?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I only came because the night was so clear. I am now on my way home.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am glad we have met. I want to know if you will let me do something for
      you, to give me an occupation, as an idle man? I am sure I ought to help
      you, for I know you are almost without friends.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated. 'Why should you tell me that?' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'In the hope that you will be frank with me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am not altogether without friends here. But I am going to make a little
      change in my life-to go out as a teacher of freehand drawing and practical
      perspective, of course I mean on a comparatively humble scale, because I
      have not been specially educated for that profession. But I am sure I
      shall like it much.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You have an opening?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have not exactly got it, but I have advertised for one.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lucy, you must let me help you!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not at all.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You need not think it would compromise you, or that I am indifferent to
      delicacy. I bear in mind how we stand. It is very unlikely that you will
      succeed as teacher of the class you mention, so let me do something of a
      different kind for you. Say what you would like, and it shall be done.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No; if I can't be a drawing-mistress or governess, or something of that
      sort, I shall go to India and join my brother.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I wish I could go abroad, anywhere, everywhere with you, Lucy, and leave
      this place and its associations for ever!'
    </p>
    <p>
      She played with the end of her bonnet-string, and hastily turned aside.
      'Don't ever touch upon that kind of topic again,' she said, with a quick
      severity not free from anger. 'It simply makes it impossible for me to see
      you, much less receive any guidance from you. No, thank you, Mr. Barnet;
      you can do nothing for me at present; and as I suppose my uncertainty will
      end in my leaving for India, I fear you never will. If ever I think you
      can do anything, I will take the trouble to ask you. Till then, good-bye.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The tone of her latter words was equivocal, and while he remained in doubt
      whether a gentle irony was or was not inwrought with their sound, she
      swept lightly round and left him alone. He saw her form get smaller and
      smaller along the damp belt of sea-sand between ebb and flood; and when
      she had vanished round the cliff into the harbour-road, he himself
      followed in the same direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      That her hopes from an advertisement should be the single thread which
      held Lucy Savile in England was too much for Barnet. On reaching the town
      he went straight to the residence of Downe, now a widower with four
      children. The young motherless brood had been sent to bed about a quarter
      of an hour earlier, and when Barnet entered he found Downe sitting alone.
      It was the same room as that from which the family had been looking out
      for Downe at the beginning of the year, when Downe had slipped into the
      gutter and his wife had been so enviably tender towards him. The old
      neatness had gone from the house; articles lay in places which could show
      no reason for their presence, as if momentarily deposited there some
      months ago, and forgotten ever since; there were no flowers; things were
      jumbled together on the furniture which should have been in cupboards; and
      the place in general had that stagnant, unrenovated air which usually
      pervades the maimed home of the widower.
    </p>
    <p>
      Downe soon renewed his customary full-worded lament over his wife, and
      even when he had worked himself up to tears, went on volubly, as if a
      listener were a luxury to be enjoyed whenever he could be caught.
    </p>
    <p>
      'She was a treasure beyond compare, Mr. Barnet! I shall never see such
      another. Nobody now to nurse me-nobody to console me in those daily
      troubles, you know, Barnet, which make consolation so necessary to a
      nature like mine. It would be unbecoming to repine, for her spirit's home
      was elsewhere-the tender light in her eyes always showed it; but it is a
      long dreary time that I have before me, and nobody else can ever fill the
      void left in my heart by her loss-nobody-nobody!' And Downe wiped his eyes
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'She was a good woman in the highest sense,' gravely answered Barnet, who,
      though Downe's words drew genuine compassion from his heart, could not
      help feeling that a tender reticence would have been a finer tribute to
      Mrs. Downe's really sterling virtues than such a second-class lament as
      this.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have something to show you,' Downe resumed, producing from a drawer a
      sheet of paper on which was an elaborate design for a canopied tomb. 'This
      has been sent me by the architect, but it is not exactly what I want.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You have got Jones to do it, I see, the man who is carrying out my
      house,' said Barnet, as he glanced at the signature to the drawing.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, but it is not quite what I want. I want something more striking-more
      like a tomb I have seen in St. Paul's Cathedral. Nothing less will do
      justice to my feelings, and how far short of them that will fall!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Barnet privately thought the design a sufficiently imposing one as it
      stood, even extravagantly ornate; but, feeling that he had no right to
      criticize, he said gently, 'Downe, should you not live more in your
      children's lives at the present time, and soften the sharpness of regret
      for your own past by thinking of their future?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, yes; but what can I do more?' asked Downe, wrinkling his forehead
      hopelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was with anxious slowness that Barnet produced his reply-the secret
      object of his visit to-night. 'Did you not say one day that you ought by
      rights to get a governess for the children?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Downe admitted that he had said so, but that he could not see his way to
      it. 'The kind of woman I should like to have,' he said, 'would be rather
      beyond my means. No; I think I shall send them to school in the town when
      they are old enough to go out alone.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now, I know of something better than that. The late Lieutenant Savile's
      daughter, Lucy, wants to do something for herself in the way of teaching.
      She would be inexpensive, and would answer your purpose as well as anybody
      for six or twelve months. She would probably come daily if you were to ask
      her, and so your housekeeping arrangements would not be much affected.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I thought she had gone away,' said the solicitor, musing. 'Where does she
      live?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Barnet told him, and added that, if Downe should think of her as suitable,
      he would do well to call as soon as possible, or she might be on the wing.
      'If you do see her,' he said, 'it would be advisable not to mention my
      name. She is rather stiff in her ideas of me, and it might prejudice her
      against a course if she knew that I recommended it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Downe promised to give the subject his consideration, and nothing more was
      said about it just then. But when Barnet rose to go, which was not till
      nearly bedtime, he reminded Downe of the suggestion and went up the street
      to his own solitary home with a sense of satisfaction at his promising
      diplomacy in a charitable cause.

    <h2>
      VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      The walls of his new house were carried up nearly to their full height. By
      a curious though not infrequent reaction, Barnet's feelings about that
      unnecessary structure had undergone a change; he took considerable
      interest in its progress as a long-neglected thing, his wife before her
      departure having grown quite weary of it as a hobby. Moreover, it was an
      excellent distraction for a man in the unhappy position of having to live
      in a provincial town with nothing to do. He was probably the first of his
      line who had ever passed a day without toil, and perhaps something like an
      inherited instinct disqualifies such men for a life of pleasant inaction,
      such as lies in the power of those whose leisure is not a personal
      accident, but a vast historical accretion which has become part of their
      natures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus Barnet got into a way of spending many of his leisure hours on the
      site of the new building, and he might have been seen on most days at this
      time trying the temper of the mortar by punching the joints with his
      stick, looking at the grain of a floor-board, and meditating where it
      grew, or picturing under what circumstances the last fire would be kindled
      in the at present sootless chimneys. One day when thus occupied he saw
      three children pass by in the company of a fair young woman, whose sudden
      appearance caused him to flush perceptibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, she is there,' he thought. 'That's a blessed thing.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Casting an interested glance over the rising building and the busy
      workmen, Lucy Savile and the little Downes passed by; and after that time
      it became a regular though almost unconscious custom of Barnet to stand in
      the half-completed house and look from the ungarnished windows at the
      governess as she tripped towards the sea-shore with her young charges,
      which she was in the habit of doing on most fine afternoons. It was on one
      of these occasions, when he had been loitering on the first-floor landing,
      near the hole left for the staircase, not yet erected, that there appeared
      above the edge of the floor a little hat, followed by a little head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barnet withdrew through a doorway, and the child came to the top of the
      ladder, stepping on to the floor and crying to her sisters and Miss Savile
      to follow. Another head rose above the floor, and another, and then Lucy
      herself came into view. The troop ran hither and thither through the
      empty, shaving-strewn rooms, and Barnet came forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy uttered a small exclamation: she was very sorry that she had
      intruded; she had not the least idea that Mr. Barnet was there: the
      children had come up, and she had followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barnet replied that he was only too glad to see them there. 'And now, let
      me show you the rooms,' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She passively assented, and he took her round. There was not much to show
      in such a bare skeleton of a house, but he made the most of it, and
      explained the different ornamental fittings that were soon to be fixed
      here and there. Lucy made but few remarks in reply, though she seemed
      pleased with her visit, and stole away down the ladder, followed by her
      companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this the new residence became yet more of a hobby for Barnet.
      Downe's children did not forget their first visit, and when the windows
      were glazed, and the handsome staircase spread its broad low steps into
      the hall, they came again, prancing in unwearied succession through every
      room from ground-floor to attics, while Lucy stood waiting for them at the
      door. Barnet, who rarely missed a day in coming to inspect progress,
      stepped out from the drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I could not keep them out,' she said, with an apologetic blush. 'I tried
      to do so very much: but they are rather wilful, and we are directed to
      walk this way for the sea air.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do let them make the house their regular playground, and you yours,' said
      Barnet. 'There is no better place for children to romp and take their
      exercise in than an empty house, particularly in muddy or damp weather
      such as we shall get a good deal of now; and this place will not be
      furnished for a long long time-perhaps never. I am not at all decided
      about it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, but it must!' replied Lucy, looking round at the hall. 'The rooms are
      excellent, twice as high as ours; and the views from the windows are so
      lovely.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I daresay, I daresay,' he said absently.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Will all the furniture be new?' she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      'All the furniture be new-that's a thing I have not thought of. In fact I
      only come here and look on. My father's house would have been large enough
      for me, but another person had a voice in the matter, and it was settled
      that we should build. However, the place grows upon me; its recent
      associations are cheerful, and I am getting to like it fast.'
    </p>
    <p>
      A certain uneasiness in Lucy's manner showed that the conversation was
      taking too personal a turn for her. 'Still, as modern tastes develop,
      people require more room to gratify them in,' she said, withdrawing to
      call the children; and serenely bidding him good afternoon she went on her
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barnet's life at this period was singularly lonely, and yet he was happier
      than he could have expected. His wife's estrangement and absence, which
      promised to be permanent, left him free as a boy in his movements, and the
      solitary walks that he took gave him ample opportunity for chastened
      reflection on what might have been his lot if he had only shown wisdom
      enough to claim Lucy Savile when there was no bar between their lives, and
      she was to be had for the asking. He would occasionally call at the house
      of his friend Downe; but there was scarcely enough in common between their
      two natures to make them more than friends of that excellent sort whose
      personal knowledge of each other's history and character is always in
      excess of intimacy, whereby they are not so likely to be severed by a
      clash of sentiment as in cases where intimacy springs up in excess of
      knowledge. Lucy was never visible at these times, being either engaged in
      the school-room, or in taking an airing out of doors; but, knowing that
      she was now comfortable, and had given up the, to him, depressing idea of
      going off to the other side of the globe, he was quite content.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new house had so far progressed that the gardeners were beginning to
      grass down the front. During an afternoon which he was passing in marking
      the curve for the carriage-drive, he beheld her coming in boldly towards
      him from the road. Hitherto Barnet had only caught her on the premises by
      stealth; and this advance seemed to show that at last her reserve had
      broken down.
    </p>
    <p>
      A smile gained strength upon her face as she approached, and it was quite
      radiant when she came up, and said, without a trace of embarrassment, 'I
      find I owe you a hundred thanks-and it comes to me quite as a surprise! It
      was through your kindness that I was engaged by Mr. Downe. Believe me, Mr.
      Barnet, I did not know it until yesterday, or I should have thanked you
      long and long ago!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I had offended you-just a trifle-at the time, I think?' said Barnet,
      smiling, 'and it was best that you should not know.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, yes,' she returned hastily. 'Don't allude to that; it is past and
      over, and we will let it be. The house is finished almost, is it not? How
      beautiful it will look when the evergreens are grown! Do you call the
      style Palladian, Mr. Barnet?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I-really don't quite know what it is. Yes, it must be Palladian,
      certainly. But I'll ask Jones, the architect; for, to tell the truth, I
      had not thought much about the style: I had nothing to do with choosing
      it, I am sorry to say.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She would not let him harp on this gloomy refrain, and talked on bright
      matters till she said, producing a small roll of paper which he had
      noticed in her hand all the while, 'Mr. Downe wished me to bring you this
      revised drawing of the late Mrs. Downe's tomb, which the architect has
      just sent him. He would like you to look it over.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The children came up with their hoops, and she went off with them down the
      harbour-road as usual. Barnet had been glad to get those words of thanks;
      he had been thinking for many months that he would like her to know of his
      share in finding her a home such as it was; and what he could not do for
      himself, Downe had now kindly done for him. He returned to his desolate
      house with a lighter tread; though in reason he hardly knew why his tread
      should be light.
    </p>
    <p>
      On examining the drawing, Barnet found that, instead of the vast altar-
      tomb and canopy Downe had determined on at their last meeting, it was to
      be a more modest memorial even than had been suggested by the architect; a
      coped tomb of good solid construction, with no useless elaboration at all.
      Barnet was truly glad to see that Downe had come to reason of his own
      accord; and he returned the drawing with a note of approval.
    </p>
    <p>
      He followed up the house-work as before, and as he walked up and down the
      rooms, occasionally gazing from the windows over the bulging green hills
      and the quiet harbour that lay between them, he murmured words and
      fragments of words, which, if listened to, would have revealed all the
      secrets of his existence. Whatever his reason in going there, Lucy did not
      call again: the walk to the shore seemed to be abandoned: he must have
      thought it as well for both that it should be so, for he did not go
      anywhere out of his accustomed ways to endeavour to discover her.

    <h2>
      VIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      The winter and the spring had passed, and the house was complete. It was a
      fine morning in the early part of June, and Barnet, though not in the
      habit of rising early, had taken a long walk before breakfast; returning
      by way of the new building. A sufficiently exciting cause of his
      restlessness to-day might have been the intelligence which had reached him
      the night before, that Lucy Savile was going to India after all, and
      notwithstanding the representations of her friends that such a journey was
      unadvisable in many ways for an unpractised girl, unless some more
      definite advantage lay at the end of it than she could show to be the
      case. Barnet's walk up the slope to the building betrayed that he was in a
      dissatisfied mood. He hardly saw that the dewy time of day lent an unusual
      freshness to the bushes and trees which had so recently put on their
      summer habit of heavy leafage, and made his newly-laid lawn look as well
      established as an old manorial meadow. The house had been so adroitly
      placed between six tall elms which were growing on the site beforehand,
      that they seemed like real ancestral trees; and the rooks, young and old,
      cawed melodiously to their visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door was not locked, and he entered. No workmen appeared to be
      present, and he walked from sunny window to sunny window of the empty
      rooms, with a sense of seclusion which might have been very pleasant but
      for the antecedent knowledge that his almost paternal care of Lucy Savile
      was to be thrown away by her wilfulness. Footsteps echoed through an
      adjoining room; and bending his eyes in that direction, he perceived Mr.
      Jones, the architect. He had come to look over the building before giving
      the contractor his final certificate. They walked over the house together.
      Everything was finished except the papering: there were the latest
      improvements of the period in bell- hanging, ventilating, smoke-jacks,
      fire-grates, and French windows. The business was soon ended, and Jones,
      having directed Barnet's attention to a roll of wall-paper patterns which
      lay on a bench for his choice, was leaving to keep another engagement,
      when Barnet said, 'Is the tomb finished yet for Mrs. Downe?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well-yes: it is at last,' said the architect, coming back and speaking as
      if he were in a mood to make a confidence. 'I have had no end of trouble
      in the matter, and, to tell the truth, I am heartily glad it is over.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Barnet expressed his surprise. 'I thought poor Downe had given up those
      extravagant notions of his? then he has gone back to the altar and canopy
      after all? Well, he is to be excused, poor fellow!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no-he has not at all gone back to them-quite the reverse,' Jones
      hastened to say. 'He has so reduced design after design, that the whole
      thing has been nothing but waste labour for me; till in the end it has
      become a common headstone, which a mason put up in half a day.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A common headstone?' said Barnet.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. I held out for some time for the addition of a footstone at least.
      But he said, "O no-he couldn't afford it."'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, well-his family is growing up, poor fellow, and his expenses are
      getting serious.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, exactly,' said Jones, as if the subject were none of his. And again
      directing Barnet's attention to the wall-papers, the bustling architect
      left him to keep some other engagement.
    </p>
    <p>
      'A common headstone,' murmured Barnet, left again to himself. He mused a
      minute or two, and next began looking over and selecting from the
      patterns; but had not long been engaged in the work when he heard another
      footstep on the gravel without, and somebody enter the open porch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barnet went to the door-it was his manservant in search of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have been trying for some time to find you, sir,' he said. 'This letter
      has come by the post, and it is marked immediate. And there's this one
      from Mr. Downe, who called just now wanting to see you.' He searched his
      pocket for the second.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barnet took the first letter-it had a black border, and bore the London
      postmark. It was not in his wife's handwriting, or in that of any person
      he knew; but conjecture soon ceased as he read the page, wherein he was
      briefly informed that Mrs. Barnet had died suddenly on the previous day,
      at the furnished villa she had occupied near London.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barnet looked vaguely round the empty hall, at the blank walls, out of the
      doorway. Drawing a long palpitating breath, and with eyes downcast, he
      turned and climbed the stairs slowly, like a man who doubted their
      stability. The fact of his wife having, as it were, died once already, and
      lived on again, had entirely dislodged the possibility of her actual death
      from his conjecture. He went to the landing, leant over the balusters, and
      after a reverie, of whose duration he had but the faintest notion, turned
      to the window and stretched his gaze to the cottage further down the road,
      which was visible from his landing, and from which Lucy still walked to
      the solicitor's house by a cross path. The faint words that came from his
      moving lips were simply, 'At last!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, almost involuntarily, Barnet fell down on his knees and murmured
      some incoherent words of thanksgiving. Surely his virtue in restoring his
      wife to life had been rewarded! But, as if the impulse struck uneasily on
      his conscience, he quickly rose, brushed the dust from his trousers and
      set himself to think of his next movements. He could not start for London
      for some hours; and as he had no preparations to make that could not be
      made in half-an-hour, he mechanically descended and resumed his occupation
      of turning over the wall-papers. They had all got brighter for him, those
      papers. It was all changed-who would sit in the rooms that they were to
      line? He went on to muse upon Lucy's conduct in so frequently coming to
      the house with the children; her occasional blush in speaking to him; her
      evident interest in him. What woman can in the long run avoid being
      interested in a man whom she knows to be devoted to her? If human
      solicitation could ever effect anything, there should be no going to India
      for Lucy now. All the papers previously chosen seemed wrong in their
      shades, and he began from the beginning to choose again.
    </p>
    <p>
      While entering on the task he heard a forced 'Ahem!' from without the
      porch, evidently uttered to attract his attention, and footsteps again
      advancing to the door. His man, whom he had quite forgotten in his mental
      turmoil, was still waiting there.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I beg your pardon, sir,' the man said from round the doorway; 'but here's
      the note from Mr. Downe that you didn't take. He called just after you
      went out, and as he couldn't wait, he wrote this on your study-table.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He handed in the letter-no black-bordered one now, but a practical-
      looking note in the well-known writing of the solicitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      'DEAR BARNET'-it ran-'Perhaps you will be prepared for the information I
      am about to give-that Lucy Savile and myself are going to be married this
      morning. I have hitherto said nothing as to my intention to any of my
      friends, for reasons which I am sure you will fully appreciate. The crisis
      has been brought about by her expressing her intention to join her brother
      in India. I then discovered that I could not do without her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is to be quite a private wedding; but it is my particular wish that
      you come down here quietly at ten, and go to church with us; it will add
      greatly to the pleasure I shall experience in the ceremony, and, I
      believe, to Lucy's also. I have called on you very early to make the
      request, in the belief that I should find you at home; but you are
      beforehand with me in your early rising.-Yours sincerely, C. Downe.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Need I wait, sir?' said the servant after a dead silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      'That will do, William. No answer,' said Barnet calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the man had gone Barnet re-read the letter. Turning eventually to the
      wall-papers, which he had been at such pains to select, he deliberately
      tore them into halves and quarters, and threw them into the empty
      fireplace. Then he went out of the house; locked the door, and stood in
      the front awhile. Instead of returning into the town, he went down the
      harbour-road and thoughtfully lingered about by the sea, near the spot
      where the body of Downe's late wife had been found and brought ashore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barnet was a man with a rich capacity for misery, and there is no doubt
      that he exercised it to its fullest extent now. The events that had, as it
      were, dashed themselves together into one half-hour of this day showed
      that curious refinement of cruelty in their arrangement which often
      proceeds from the bosom of the whimsical god at other times known as blind
      Circumstance. That his few minutes of hope, between the reading of the
      first and second letters, had carried him to extraordinary heights of
      rapture was proved by the immensity of his suffering now. The sun blazing
      into his face would have shown a close watcher that a horizontal line,
      which he had never noticed before, but which was never to be gone
      thereafter, was somehow gradually forming itself in the smooth of his
      forehead. His eyes, of a light hazel, had a curious look which can only be
      described by the word bruised; the sorrow that looked from them being
      largely mixed with the surprise of a man taken unawares.
    </p>
    <p>
      The secondary particulars of his present position, too, were odd enough,
      though for some time they appeared to engage little of his attention. Not
      a soul in the town knew, as yet, of his wife's death; and he almost owed
      Downe the kindness of not publishing it till the day was over: the
      conjuncture, taken with that which had accompanied the death of Mrs.
      Downe, being so singular as to be quite sufficient to darken the pleasure
      of the impressionable solicitor to a cruel extent, if made known to him.
      But as Barnet could not set out on his journey to London, where his wife
      lay, for some hours (there being at this date no railway within a distance
      of many miles), no great reason existed why he should leave the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      Impulse in all its forms characterized Barnet, and when he heard the
      distant clock strike the hour of ten his feet began to carry him up the
      harbour-road with the manner of a man who must do something to bring
      himself to life. He passed Lucy Savile's old house, his own new one, and
      came in view of the church. Now he gave a perceptible start, and his
      mechanical condition went away. Before the church-gate were a couple of
      carriages, and Barnet then could perceive that the marriage between Downe
      and Lucy was at that moment being solemnized within. A feeling of sudden,
      proud self-confidence, an indocile wish to walk unmoved in spite of grim
      environments, plainly possessed him, and when he reached the wicket-gate
      he turned in without apparent effort. Pacing up the paved footway he
      entered the church and stood for a while in the nave passage. A group of
      people was standing round the vestry door; Barnet advanced through these
      and stepped into the vestry.
    </p>
    <p>
      There they were, busily signing their names. Seeing Downe about to look
      round, Barnet averted his somewhat disturbed face for a second or two;
      when he turned again front to front he was calm and quite smiling; it was
      a creditable triumph over himself, and deserved to be remembered in his
      native town. He greeted Downe heartily, offering his congratulations.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed as if Barnet expected a half-guilty look upon Lucy's face; but
      no, save the natural flush and flurry engendered by the service just
      performed, there was nothing whatever in her bearing which showed a
      disturbed mind: her gray-brown eyes carried in them now as at other times
      the well-known expression of common-sensed rectitude which never went so
      far as to touch on hardness. She shook hands with him, and Downe said
      warmly, 'I wish you could have come sooner: I called on purpose to ask
      you. You'll drive back with us now?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, no,' said Barnet; 'I am not at all prepared; but I thought I would
      look in upon you for a moment, even though I had not time to go home and
      dress. I'll stand back and see you pass out, and observe the effect of the
      spectacle upon myself as one of the public.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Lucy and her husband laughed, and Barnet laughed and retired; and the
      quiet little party went gliding down the nave and towards the porch,
      Lucy's new silk dress sweeping with a smart rustle round the base-
      mouldings of the ancient font, and Downe's little daughters following in a
      state of round-eyed interest in their position, and that of Lucy, their
      teacher and friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Downe was comforted after his Emily's death, which had taken place
      twelve months, two weeks, and three days before that time.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the two flys had driven off and the spectators had vanished, Barnet
      followed to the door, and went out into the sun. He took no more trouble
      to preserve a spruce exterior; his step was unequal, hesitating, almost
      convulsive; and the slight changes of colour which went on in his face
      seemed refracted from some inward flame. In the churchyard he became pale
      as a summer cloud, and finding it not easy to proceed he sat down on one
      of the tombstones and supported his head with his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hard by was a sexton filling up a grave which he had not found time to
      finish on the previous evening. Observing Barnet, he went up to him, and
      recognizing him, said, 'Shall I help you home, sir?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no, thank you,' said Barnet, rousing himself and standing up. The
      sexton returned to his grave, followed by Barnet, who, after watching him
      awhile, stepped into the grave, now nearly filled, and helped to tread in
      the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sexton apparently thought his conduct a little singular, but he made
      no observation, and when the grave was full, Barnet suddenly stopped,
      looked far away, and with a decided step proceeded to the gate and
      vanished. The sexton rested on his shovel and looked after him for a few
      moments, and then began banking up the mound.
    </p>
    <p>
      In those short minutes of treading in the dead man Barnet had formed a
      design, but what it was the inhabitants of that town did not for some long
      time imagine. He went home, wrote several letters of business, called on
      his lawyer, an old man of the same place who had been the legal adviser of
      Barnet's father before him, and during the evening overhauled a large
      quantity of letters and other documents in his possession. By eleven
      o'clock the heap of papers in and before Barnet's grate had reached
      formidable dimensions, and he began to burn them. This, owing to their
      quantity, it was not so easy to do as he had expected, and he sat long
      into the night to complete the task.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning Barnet departed for London, leaving a note for Downe to
      inform him of Mrs. Barnet's sudden death, and that he was gone to bury
      her; but when a thrice-sufficient time for that purpose had elapsed, he
      was not seen again in his accustomed walks, or in his new house, or in his
      old one. He was gone for good, nobody knew whither. It was soon discovered
      that he had empowered his lawyer to dispose of all his property, real and
      personal, in the borough, and pay in the proceeds to the account of an
      unknown person at one of the large London banks. The person was by some
      supposed to be himself under an assumed name; but few, if any, had certain
      knowledge of that fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      The elegant new residence was sold with the rest of his possessions; and
      its purchaser was no other than Downe, now a thriving man in the borough,
      and one whose growing family and new wife required more roomy
      accommodation than was afforded by the little house up the narrow side
      street. Barnet's old habitation was bought by the trustees of the
      Congregational Baptist body in that town, who pulled down the time-
      honoured dwelling and built a new chapel on its site. By the time the last
      hour of that, to Barnet, eventful year had chimed, every vestige of him
      had disappeared from the precincts of his native place, and the name
      became extinct in the borough of Port-Bredy, after having been a living
      force therein for more than two hundred years.

    <p>
      Twenty-one years and six months do not pass without setting a mark even
      upon durable stone and triple brass; upon humanity such a period works
      nothing less than transformation. In Barnet's old birthplace vivacious
      young children with bones like india-rubber had grown up to be stable men
      and women, men and women had dried in the skin, stiffened, withered, and
      sunk into decrepitude; while selections from every class had been
      consigned to the outlying cemetery. Of inorganic differences the greatest
      was that a railway had invaded the town, tying it on to a main line at a
      junction a dozen miles off. Barnet's house on the harbour- road, once so
      insistently new, had acquired a respectable mellowness, with ivy, Virginia
      creepers, lichens, damp patches, and even constitutional infirmities of
      its own like its elder fellows. Its architecture, once so very improved
      and modern, had already become stale in style, without having reached the
      dignity of being old-fashioned. Trees about the harbour-road had increased
      in circumference or disappeared under the saw; while the church had had
      such a tremendous practical joke played upon it by some facetious restorer
      or other as to be scarce recognizable by its dearest old friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this long interval George Barnet had never once been seen or heard
      of in the town of his fathers.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the evening of a market-day, and some half-dozen middle-aged
      farmers and dairymen were lounging round the bar of the Black-Bull Hotel,
      occasionally dropping a remark to each other, and less frequently to the
      two barmaids who stood within the pewter-topped counter in a perfunctory
      attitude of attention, these latter sighing and making a private
      observation to one another at odd intervals, on more interesting
      experiences than the present.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Days get shorter,' said one of the dairymen, as he looked towards the
      street, and noticed that the lamp-lighter was passing by.
    </p>
    <p>
      The farmers merely acknowledged by their countenances the propriety of
      this remark, and finding that nobody else spoke, one of the barmaids said
      'yes,' in a tone of painful duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Come fair-day we shall have to light up before we start for home- along.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's true,' his neighbour conceded, with a gaze of blankness.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And after that we shan't see much further difference all's winter.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest were not unwilling to go even so far as this.
    </p>
    <p>
      The barmaid sighed again, and raised one of her hands from the counter on
      which they rested to scratch the smallest surface of her face with the
      smallest of her fingers. She looked towards the door, and presently
      remarked, 'I think I hear the 'bus coming in from station.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The eyes of the dairymen and farmers turned to the glass door dividing the
      hall from the porch, and in a minute or two the omnibus drew up outside.
      Then there was a lumbering down of luggage, and then a man came into the
      hall, followed by a porter with a portmanteau on his poll, which he
      deposited on a bench.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger was an elderly person, with curly ashen white hair, a
      deeply-creviced outer corner to each eyelid, and a countenance baked by
      innumerable suns to the colour of terra-cotta, its hue and that of his
      hair contrasting like heat and cold respectively. He walked meditatively
      and gently, like one who was fearful of disturbing his own mental
      equilibrium. But whatever lay at the bottom of his breast had evidently
      made him so accustomed to its situation there that it caused him little
      practical inconvenience.
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused in silence while, with his dubious eyes fixed on the barmaids,
      he seemed to consider himself. In a moment or two he addressed them, and
      asked to be accommodated for the night. As he waited he looked curiously
      round the hall, but said nothing. As soon as invited he disappeared up the
      staircase, preceded by a chambermaid and candle, and followed by a lad
      with his trunk. Not a soul had recognized him.
    </p>
    <p>
      A quarter of an hour later, when the farmers and dairymen had driven off
      to their homesteads in the country, he came downstairs, took a biscuit and
      one glass of wine, and walked out into the town, where the radiance from
      the shop-windows had grown so in volume of late years as to flood with
      cheerfulness every standing cart, barrow, stall, and idler that occupied
      the wayside, whether shabby or genteel. His chief interest at present
      seemed to lie in the names painted over the shop-fronts and on door-ways,
      as far as they were visible; these now differed to an ominous extent from
      what they had been one-and-twenty years before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The traveller passed on till he came to the bookseller's, where he looked
      in through the glass door. A fresh-faced young man was standing behind the
      counter, otherwise the shop was empty. The gray-haired observer entered,
      asked for some periodical by way of paying for admission, and with his
      elbow on the counter began to turn over the pages he had bought, though
      that he read nothing was obvious.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length he said, 'Is old Mr. Watkins still alive?' in a voice which had
      a curious youthful cadence in it even now.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My father is dead, sir,' said the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, I am sorry to hear it,' said the stranger. 'But it is so many years
      since I last visited this town that I could hardly expect it should be
      otherwise.' After a short silence he continued-'And is the firm of Barnet,
      Browse, and Company still in existence?-they used to be large
      flax-merchants and twine-spinners here?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The firm is still going on, sir, but they have dropped the name of
      Barnet. I believe that was a sort of fancy name-at least, I never knew of
      any living Barnet. 'Tis now Browse and Co.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And does Andrew Jones still keep on as architect?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He's dead, sir.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And the Vicar of St. Mary's-Mr. Melrose?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He's been dead a great many years.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dear me!' He paused yet longer, and cleared his voice. 'Is Mr. Downe, the
      solicitor, still in practice?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, sir, he's dead. He died about seven years ago.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Here it was a longer silence still; and an attentive observer would have
      noticed that the paper in the stranger's hand increased its imperceptible
      tremor to a visible shake. That gray-haired gentleman noticed it himself,
      and rested the paper on the counter. 'Is Mrs. Downe still alive?' he
      asked, closing his lips firmly as soon as the words were out of his mouth,
      and dropping his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, sir, she's alive and well. She's living at the old place.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'In East Street?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no; at Chateau Ringdale. I believe it has been in the family for some
      generations.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She lives with her children, perhaps?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No; she has no children of her own. There were some Miss Downes; I think
      they were Mr. Downe's daughters by a former wife; but they are married and
      living in other parts of the town. Mrs. Downe lives alone.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Quite alone?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, sir; quite alone.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The newly-arrived gentleman went back to the hotel and dined; after which
      he made some change in his dress, shaved back his beard to the fashion
      that had prevailed twenty years earlier, when he was young and
      interesting, and once more emerging, bent his steps in the direction of
      the harbour-road. Just before getting to the point where the pavement
      ceased and the houses isolated themselves, he overtook a shambling,
      stooping, unshaven man, who at first sight appeared like a professional
      tramp, his shoulders having a perceptible greasiness as they passed under
      the gaslight. Each pedestrian momentarily turned and regarded the other,
      and the tramp-like gentleman started back.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good-why-is that Mr. Barnet? 'Tis Mr. Barnet, surely!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes; and you are Charlson?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes-ah-you notice my appearance. The Fates have rather ill-used me.
      By-the-bye, that fifty pounds. I never paid it, did I? . . . But I was not
      ungrateful!' Here the stooping man laid one hand emphatically on the palm
      of the other. 'I gave you a chance, Mr. George Barnet, which many men
      would have thought full value received-the chance to marry your Lucy. As
      far as the world was concerned, your wife was a drowned woman, hey?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Heaven forbid all that, Charlson!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, well, 'twas a wrong way of showing gratitude, I suppose. And now a
      drop of something to drink for old acquaintance' sake! And Mr. Barnet,
      she's again free-there's a chance now if you care for it-ha, ha!' And the
      speaker pushed his tongue into his hollow cheek and slanted his eye in the
      old fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I know all,' said Barnet quickly; and slipping a small present into the
      hands of the needy, saddening man, he stepped ahead and was soon in the
      outskirts of the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reached the harbour-road, and paused before the entrance to a well-
      known house. It was so highly bosomed in trees and shrubs planted since
      the erection of the building that one would scarcely have recognized the
      spot as that which had been a mere neglected slope till chosen as a site
      for a dwelling. He opened the swing-gate, closed it noiselessly, and
      gently moved into the semicircular drive, which remained exactly as it had
      been marked out by Barnet on the morning when Lucy Savile ran in to thank
      him for procuring her the post of governess to Downe's children. But the
      growth of trees and bushes which revealed itself at every step was beyond
      all expectation; sun-proof and moon-proof bowers vaulted the walks, and
      the walls of the house were uniformly bearded with creeping plants as high
      as the first-floor windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      After lingering for a few minutes in the dusk of the bending boughs, the
      visitor rang the door-bell, and on the servant appearing, he announced
      himself as 'an old friend of Mrs. Downe's.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The hall was lighted, but not brightly, the gas being turned low, as if
      visitors were rare. There was a stagnation in the dwelling; it seemed to
      be waiting. Could it really be waiting for him? The partitions which had
      been probed by Barnet's walking-stick when the mortar was green, were now
      quite brown with the antiquity of their varnish, and the ornamental
      woodwork of the staircase, which had glistened with a pale yellow newness
      when first erected, was now of a rich wine-colour. During the servant's
      absence the following colloquy could be dimly heard through the nearly
      closed door of the drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He didn't give his name?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He only said "an old friend," ma'am.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What kind of gentleman is he?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A staidish gentleman, with gray hair.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice of the second speaker seemed to affect the listener greatly.
      After a pause, the lady said, 'Very well, I will see him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      And the stranger was shown in face to face with the Lucy who had once been
      Lucy Savile. The round cheek of that formerly young lady had, of course,
      alarmingly flattened its curve in her modern representative; a pervasive
      grayness overspread her once dark brown hair, like morning rime on
      heather. The parting down the middle was wide and jagged; once it had been
      a thin white line, a narrow crevice between two high banks of shade. But
      there was still enough left to form a handsome knob behind, and some curls
      beneath inwrought with a few hairs like silver wires were very becoming.
      In her eyes the only modification was that their originally mild rectitude
      of expression had become a little more stringent than heretofore. Yet she
      was still girlish-a girl who had been gratuitously weighted by destiny
      with a burden of five-and-forty years instead of her proper twenty.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lucy, don't you know me?' he said, when the servant had closed the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I knew you the instant I saw you!' she returned cheerfully. 'I don't know
      why, but I always thought you would come back to your old town again.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave him her hand, and then they sat down. 'They said you were dead,'
      continued Lucy, 'but I never thought so. We should have heard of it for
      certain if you had been.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is a very long time since we met.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes; what you must have seen, Mr. Barnet, in all these roving years, in
      comparison with what I have seen in this quiet place!' Her face grew more
      serious. 'You know my husband has been dead a long time? I am a lonely old
      woman now, considering what I have been; though Mr. Downe's daughters-all
      married-manage to keep me pretty cheerful.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And I am a lonely old man, and have been any time these twenty years.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But where have you kept yourself? And why did you go off so
      mysteriously?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, Lucy, I have kept myself a little in America, and a little in
      Australia, a little in India, a little at the Cape, and so on; I have not
      stayed in any place for a long time, as it seems to me, and yet more than
      twenty years have flown. But when people get to my age two years go like
      one!-Your second question, why did I go away so mysteriously, is surely
      not necessary. You guessed why, didn't you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, I never once guessed,' she said simply; 'nor did Charles, nor did
      anybody as far as I know.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, indeed! Now think it over again, and then look at me, and say if
      you can't guess?'
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked him in the face with an inquiring smile. 'Surely not because of
      me?' she said, pausing at the commencement of surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barnet nodded, and smiled again; but his smile was sadder than hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Because I married Charles?' she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes; solely because you married him on the day I was free to ask you to
      marry me. My wife died four-and-twenty hours before you went to church
      with Downe. The fixing of my journey at that particular moment was because
      of her funeral; but once away I knew I should have no inducement to come
      back, and took my steps accordingly.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face assumed an aspect of gentle reflection, and she looked up and
      down his form with great interest in her eyes. 'I never thought of it!'
      she said. 'I knew, of course, that you had once implied some warmth of
      feeling towards me, but I concluded that it passed off. And I have always
      been under the impression that your wife was alive at the time of my
      marriage. Was it not stupid of me!-But you will have some tea or
      something? I have never dined late, you know, since my husband's death. I
      have got into the way of making a regular meal of tea. You will have some
      tea with me, will you not?'
    </p>
    <p>
      The travelled man assented quite readily, and tea was brought in. They sat
      and chatted over the meal, regardless of the flying hour. 'Well, well!'
      said Barnet presently, as for the first time he leisurely surveyed the
      room; 'how like it all is, and yet how different! Just where your piano
      stands was a board on a couple of trestles, bearing the patterns of
      wall-papers, when I was last here. I was choosing them-standing in this
      way, as it might be. Then my servant came in at the door, and handed me a
      note, so. It was from Downe, and announced that you were just going to be
      married to him. I chose no more wall- papers-tore up all those I had
      selected, and left the house. I never entered it again till now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, at last I understand it all,' she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had both risen and gone to the fireplace. The mantel came almost on a
      level with her shoulder, which gently rested against it, and Barnet laid
      his hand upon the shelf close beside her shoulder. 'Lucy,' he said,
      'better late than never. Will you marry me now?'
    </p>
    <p>
      She started back, and the surprise which was so obvious in her wrought
      even greater surprise in him that it should be so. It was difficult to
      believe that she had been quite blind to the situation, and yet all reason
      and common sense went to prove that she was not acting.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You take me quite unawares by such a question!' she said, with a forced
      laugh of uneasiness. It was the first time she had shown any embarrassment
      at all. 'Why,' she added, 'I couldn't marry you for the world.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not after all this! Why not?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is-I would-I really think I may say it-I would upon the whole rather
      marry you, Mr. Barnet, than any other man I have ever met, if I ever
      dreamed of marriage again. But I don't dream of it-it is quite out of my
      thoughts; I have not the least intention of marrying again.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But-on my account-couldn't you alter your plans a little? Come!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dear Mr. Barnet,' she said with a little flutter, 'I would on your
      account if on anybody's in existence. But you don't know in the least what
      it is you are asking-such an impracticable thing-I won't say ridiculous,
      of course, because I see that you are really in earnest, and earnestness
      is never ridiculous to my mind.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, yes,' said Barnet more slowly, dropping her hand, which he had
      taken at the moment of pleading, 'I am in earnest. The resolve, two months
      ago, at the Cape, to come back once more was, it is true, rather sudden,
      and as I see now, not well considered. But I am in earnest in asking.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And I in declining. With all good feeling and all kindness, let me say
      that I am quite opposed to the idea of marrying a second time.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, no harm has been done,' he answered, with the same subdued and
      tender humorousness that he had shown on such occasions in early life. 'If
      you really won't accept me, I must put up with it, I suppose.' His eye
      fell on the clock as he spoke. 'Had you any notion that it was so late?'
      he asked. 'How absorbed I have been!'
    </p>
    <p>
      She accompanied him to the hall, helped him to put on his overcoat, and
      let him out of the house herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good-night,' said Barnet, on the doorstep, as the lamp shone in his face.
      'You are not offended with me?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Certainly not. Nor you with me?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll consider whether I am or not,' he pleasantly replied. 'Good- night.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She watched him safely through the gate; and when his footsteps had died
      away upon the road, closed the door softly and returned to the room. Here
      the modest widow long pondered his speeches, with eyes dropped to an
      unusually low level. Barnet's urbanity under the blow of her refusal
      greatly impressed her. After having his long period of probation rendered
      useless by her decision, he had shown no anger, and had philosophically
      taken her words as if he deserved no better ones. It was very gentlemanly
      of him, certainly; it was more than gentlemanly; it was heroic and grand.
      The more she meditated, the more she questioned the virtue of her conduct
      in checking him so peremptorily; and went to her bedroom in a mood of
      dissatisfaction. On looking in the glass she was reminded that there was
      not so much remaining of her former beauty as to make his frank
      declaration an impulsive natural homage to her cheeks and eyes; it must
      undoubtedly have arisen from an old staunch feeling of his, deserving
      tenderest consideration. She recalled to her mind with much pleasure that
      he had told her he was staying at the Black-Bull Hotel; so that if, after
      waiting a day or two, he should not, in his modesty, call again, she might
      then send him a nice little note. To alter her views for the present was
      far from her intention; but she would allow herself to be induced to
      reconsider the case, as any generous woman ought to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morrow came and passed, and Mr. Barnet did not drop in. At every
      knock, light youthful hues flew across her cheek; and she was abstracted
      in the presence of her other visitors. In the evening she walked about the
      house, not knowing what to do with herself; the conditions of existence
      seemed totally different from those which ruled only four-and- twenty
      short hours ago. What had been at first a tantalizing elusive sentiment
      was getting acclimatized within her as a definite hope, and her person was
      so informed by that emotion that she might almost have stood as its
      emblematical representative by the time the clock struck ten. In short, an
      interest in Barnet precisely resembling that of her early youth led her
      present heart to belie her yesterday's words to him, and she longed to see
      him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day she walked out early, thinking she might meet him in the
      street. The growing beauty of her romance absorbed her, and she went from
      the street to the fields, and from the fields to the shore, without any
      consciousness of distance, till reminded by her weariness that she could
      go no further. He had nowhere appeared. In the evening she took a step
      which under the circumstances seemed justifiable; she wrote a note to him
      at the hotel, inviting him to tea with her at six precisely, and signing
      her note 'Lucy.'
    </p>
    <p>
      In a quarter of an hour the messenger came back. Mr. Barnet had left the
      hotel early in the morning of the day before, but he had stated that he
      would probably return in the course of the week.
    </p>
    <p>
      The note was sent back, to be given to him immediately on his arrival.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no sign from the inn that this desired event had occurred,
      either on the next day or the day following. On both nights she had been
      restless, and had scarcely slept half-an-hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the Saturday, putting off all diffidence, Lucy went herself to the
      Black-Bull, and questioned the staff closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Barnet had cursorily remarked when leaving that he might return on the
      Thursday or Friday, but they were directed not to reserve a room for him
      unless he should write.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had left no address.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy sorrowfully took back her note went home, and resolved to wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did wait-years and years-but Barnet never reappeared.

    <h2>
      I
    </h2>
    <p>
      The north road from Casterbridge is tedious and lonely, especially in
      winter-time. Along a part of its course it connects with Long-Ash Lane, a
      monotonous track without a village or hamlet for many miles, and with very
      seldom a turning. Unapprized wayfarers who are too old, or too young, or
      in other respects too weak for the distance to be traversed, but who,
      nevertheless, have to walk it, say, as they look wistfully ahead, 'Once at
      the top of that hill, and I must surely see the end of Long-Ash Lane!' But
      they reach the hilltop, and Long-Ash Lane stretches in front as
      mercilessly as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some few years ago a certain farmer was riding through this lane in the
      gloom of a winter evening. The farmer's friend, a dairyman, was riding
      beside him. A few paces in the rear rode the farmer's man. All three were
      well horsed on strong, round-barrelled cobs; and to be well horsed was to
      be in better spirits about Long-Ash Lane than poor pedestrians could
      attain to during its passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the farmer did not talk much to his friend as he rode along. The
      enterprise which had brought him there filled his mind; for in truth it
      was important. Not altogether so important was it, perhaps, when estimated
      by its value to society at large; but if the true measure of a deed be
      proportionate to the space it occupies in the heart of him who undertakes
      it, Farmer Charles Darton's business to-night could hold its own with the
      business of kings.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a large farmer. His turnover, as it is called, was probably thirty
      thousand pounds a year. He had a great many draught horses, a great many
      milch cows, and of sheep a multitude. This comfortable position was,
      however, none of his own making. It had been created by his father, a man
      of a very different stamp from the present representative of the line.
    </p>
    <p>
      Darton, the father, had been a one-idea'd character, with a buttoned-up
      pocket and a chink-like eye brimming with commercial subtlety. In Darton
      the son, this trade subtlety had become transmuted into emotional, and the
      harshness had disappeared; he would have been called a sad man but for his
      constant care not to divide himself from lively friends by piping notes
      out of harmony with theirs. Contemplative, he allowed his mind to be a
      quiet meeting-place for memories and hopes. So that, naturally enough,
      since succeeding to the agricultural calling, and up to his present age of
      thirty-two, he had neither advanced nor receded as a capitalist-a
      stationary result which did not agitate one of his unambitious,
      unstrategic nature, since he had all that he desired. The motive of his
      expedition to-night showed the same absence of anxious regard for Number
      One.
    </p>
    <p>
      The party rode on in the slow, safe trot proper to night-time and bad
      roads, Farmer Darton's head jigging rather unromantically up and down
      against the sky, and his motions being repeated with bolder emphasis by
      his friend Japheth Johns; while those of the latter were travestied in
      jerks still less softened by art in the person of the lad who attended
      them. A pair of whitish objects hung one on each side of the latter,
      bumping against him at each step, and still further spoiling the grace of
      his seat. On close inspection they might have been perceived to be open
      rush baskets-one containing a turkey, and the other some bottles of wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      'D'ye feel ye can meet your fate like a man, neighbour Darton?' asked
      Johns, breaking a silence which had lasted while five-and-twenty hedgerow
      trees had glided by.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Darton with a half-laugh murmured, 'Ay-call it my fate! Hanging and
      wiving go by destiny.' And then they were silent again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The darkness thickened rapidly, at intervals shutting down on the land in
      a perceptible flap, like the wave of a wing. The customary close of day
      was accelerated by a simultaneous blurring of the air. With the fall of
      night had come a mist just damp enough to incommode, but not sufficient to
      saturate them. Countrymen as they were-born, as may be said, with only an
      open door between them and the four seasons-they regarded the mist but as
      an added obscuration, and ignored its humid quality.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were travelling in a direction that was enlivened by no modern
      current of traffic, the place of Darton's pilgrimage being an old-
      fashioned village-one of the Hintocks (several villages of that name, with
      a distinctive prefix or affix, lying thereabout)-where the people make the
      best cider and cider-wine in all Wessex, and where the dunghills smell of
      pomace instead of stable refuse as elsewhere. The lane was sometimes so
      narrow that the brambles of the hedge, which hung forward like anglers'
      rods over a stream, scratched their hats and curry-combed their whiskers
      as they passed. Yet this neglected lane had been a highway to Queen
      Elizabeth's subjects and the cavalcades of the past. Its day was over now,
      and its history as a national artery done for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why I have decided to marry her,' resumed Darton (in a measured musical
      voice of confidence which revealed a good deal of his composition), as he
      glanced round to see that the lad was not too near, 'is not only that I
      like her, but that I can do no better, even from a fairly practical point
      of view. That I might ha' looked higher is possibly true, though it is
      really all nonsense. I have had experience enough in looking above me. "No
      more superior women for me," said I-you know when. Sally is a comely,
      independent, simple character, with no make-up about her, who'll think me
      as much a superior to her as I used to think-you know who I mean-was to
      me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ay,' said Johns. 'However, I shouldn't call Sally Hall simple. Primary,
      because no Sally is; secondary, because if some could be, this one
      wouldn't. 'Tis a wrong denomination to apply to a woman, Charles, and
      affects me, as your best man, like cold water. 'Tis like recommending a
      stage play by saying there's neither murder, villainy, nor harm of any
      sort in it, when that's what you've paid your half-crown to see.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well; may your opinion do you good. Mine's a different one.' And turning
      the conversation from the philosophical to the practical, Darton expressed
      a hope that the said Sally had received what he'd sent on by the carrier
      that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johns wanted to know what that was.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is a dress,' said Darton. 'Not exactly a wedding-dress; though she may
      use it as one if she likes. It is rather serviceable than showy-suitable
      for the winter weather.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good,' said Johns. 'Serviceable is a wise word in a bridegroom. I commend
      ye, Charles.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'For,' said Darton, 'why should a woman dress up like a rope-dancer
      because she's going to do the most solemn deed of her life except dying?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Faith, why? But she will, because she will, I suppose,' said Dairyman
      Johns.
    </p>
    <p>
      'H'm,' said Darton.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lane they followed had been nearly straight for several miles, but it
      now took a turn, and winding uncertainly for some distance forked into
      two. By night country roads are apt to reveal ungainly qualities which
      pass without observation during day; and though Darton had travelled this
      way before, he had not done so frequently, Sally having been wooed at the
      house of a relative near his own. He never remembered seeing at this spot
      a pair of alternative ways looking so equally probable as these two did
      now. Johns rode on a few steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't be out of heart, sonny,' he cried. 'Here's a handpost. Enoch-come
      and climm this post, and tell us the way.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The lad dismounted, and jumped into the hedge where the post stood under a
      tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Unstrap the baskets, or you'll smash up that wine!' cried Darton, as the
      young man began spasmodically to climb the post, baskets and all.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Was there ever less head in a brainless world?' said Johns. 'Here, simple
      Nocky, I'll do it.' He leapt off, and with much puffing climbed the post,
      striking a match when he reached the top, and moving the light along the
      arm, the lad standing and gazing at the spectacle.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have faced tantalization these twenty years with a temper as mild as
      milk!' said Japheth; 'but such things as this don't come short of
      devilry!' And flinging the match away, he slipped down to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What's the matter?' asked Darton.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not a letter, sacred or heathen-not so much as would tell us the way to
      the great fireplace-ever I should sin to say it! Either the moss and
      mildew have eat away the words, or we have arrived in a land where the
      natyves have lost the art o' writing, and should ha' brought our compass
      like Christopher Columbus.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Let us take the straightest road,' said Darton placidly; 'I shan't be
      sorry to get there-'tis a tiresome ride. I would have driven if I had
      known.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nor I neither, sir,' said Enoch. 'These straps plough my shoulder like a
      zull. If 'tis much further to your lady's home, Maister Darton, I shall
      ask to be let carry half of these good things in my innerds-hee, hee!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't you be such a reforming radical, Enoch,' said Johns sternly. 'Here,
      I'll take the turkey.'
    </p>
    <p>
      This being done, they went forward by the right-hand lane, which ascended
      a hill, the left winding away under a plantation. The pit-a- pat of their
      horses' hoofs lessened up the slope; and the ironical directing-post stood
      in solitude as before, holding out its blank arms to the raw breeze, which
      brought a snore from the wood as if Skrymir the Giant were sleeping there.

    <h2>
      II
    </h2>
    <p>
      Three miles to the left of the travellers, along the road they had not
      followed, rose an old house with mullioned windows of Ham-hill stone, and
      chimneys of lavish solidity. It stood at the top of a slope beside
      King's-Hintock village-street; and immediately in front of it grew a large
      sycamore-tree, whose bared roots formed a convenient staircase from the
      road below to the front door of the dwelling. Its situation gave the house
      what little distinctive name it possessed, namely, 'The Knap.' Some forty
      yards off a brook dribbled past, which, for its size, made a great deal of
      noise. At the back was a dairy barton, accessible for vehicles and
      live-stock by a side 'drong.' Thus much only of the character of the
      homestead could be divined out of doors at this shady evening-time.
    </p>
    <p>
      But within there was plenty of light to see by, as plenty was construed at
      Hintock. Beside a Tudor fireplace, whose moulded four-centred arch was
      nearly hidden by a figured blue-cloth blower, were seated two women-mother
      and daughter-Mrs. Hall, and Sarah, or Sally; for this was a part of the
      world where the latter modification had not as yet been effaced as a
      vulgarity by the march of intellect. The owner of the name was the young
      woman by whose means Mr. Darton proposed to put an end to his bachelor
      condition on the approaching day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mother's bereavement had been so long ago as not to leave much mark of
      its occurrence upon her now, either in face or clothes. She had resumed
      the mob-cap of her early married life, enlivening its whiteness by a few
      rose-du-Barry ribbons. Sally required no such aids to pinkness. Roseate
      good-nature lit up her gaze; her features showed curves of decision and
      judgment; and she might have been regarded without much mistake as a
      warm-hearted, quick-spirited, handsome girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did most of the talking, her mother listening with a half-absent air,
      as she picked up fragments of red-hot wood ember with the tongs, and piled
      them upon the brands. But the number of speeches that passed was very
      small in proportion to the meanings exchanged. Long experience together
      often enabled them to see the course of thought in each other's minds
      without a word being spoken. Behind them, in the centre of the room, the
      table was spread for supper, certain whiffs of air laden with fat vapours,
      which ever and anon entered from the kitchen, denoting its preparation
      there.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The new gown he was going to send you stays about on the way like
      himself,' Sally's mother was saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, not finished, I daresay,' cried Sally independently. 'Lord, I
      shouldn't be amazed if it didn't come at all! Young men make such kind
      promises when they are near you, and forget 'em when they go away. But he
      doesn't intend it as a wedding-gown-he gives it to me merely as a gown to
      wear when I like-a travelling-dress is what it would be called by some.
      Come rathe or come late it don't much matter, as I have a dress of my own
      to fall back upon. But what time is it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      She went to the family clock and opened the glass, for the hour was not
      otherwise discernible by night, and indeed at all times was rather a thing
      to be investigated than beheld, so much more wall than window was there in
      the apartment. 'It is nearly eight,' said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Eight o'clock, and neither dress nor man,' said Mrs. Hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mother, if you think to tantalize me by talking like that, you are much
      mistaken! Let him be as late as he will-or stay away altogether-I don't
      care,' said Sally. But a tender, minute quaver in the negation showed that
      there was something forced in that statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hall perceived it, and drily observed that she was not so sure about
      Sally not caring. 'But perhaps you don't care so much as I do, after all,'
      she said. 'For I see what you don't, that it is a good and flourishing
      match for you; a very honourable offer in Mr. Darton. And I think I see a
      kind husband in him. So pray God 'twill go smooth, and wind up well.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Sally would not listen to misgivings. Of course it would go smoothly, she
      asserted. 'How you are up and down, mother!' she went on. 'At this moment,
      whatever hinders him, we are not so anxious to see him as he is to be
      here, and his thought runs on before him, and settles down upon us like
      the star in the east. Hark!' she exclaimed, with a breath of relief, her
      eyes sparkling. 'I heard something. Yes-here they are!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The next moment her mother's slower ear also distinguished the familiar
      reverberation occasioned by footsteps clambering up the roots of the
      sycamore.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes it sounds like them at last,' she said. 'Well, it is not so very late
      after all, considering the distance.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The footfall ceased, and they arose, expecting a knock. They began to
      think it might have been, after all, some neighbouring villager under
      Bacchic influence, giving the centre of the road a wide berth, when their
      doubts were dispelled by the new-comer's entry into the passage. The door
      of the room was gently opened, and there appeared, not the pair of
      travellers with whom we have already made acquaintance, but a pale- faced
      man in the garb of extreme poverty-almost in rags.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, it's a tramp-gracious me!' said Sally, starting back.
    </p>
    <p>
      His cheeks and eye-orbits were deep concaves-rather, it might be, from
      natural weakness of constitution than irregular living, though there were
      indications that he had led no careful life. He gazed at the two women
      fixedly for a moment: then with an abashed, humiliated demeanour, dropped
      his glance to the floor, and sank into a chair without uttering a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sally was in advance of her mother, who had remained standing by the fire.
      She now tried to discern the visitor across the candles.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why-mother,' said Sally faintly, turning back to Mrs. Hall. 'It is Phil,
      from Australia!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hall started, and grew pale, and a fit of coughing seized the man
      with the ragged clothes. 'To come home like this!' she said. 'O,
      Philip-are you ill?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, no, mother,' replied he impatiently, as soon as he could speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But for God's sake how do you come here-and just now too?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I am here,' said the man. 'How it is I hardly know. I've come home,
      mother, because I was driven to it. Things were against me out there, and
      went from bad to worse.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then why didn't you let us know?-you've not writ a line for the last two
      or three years.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The son admitted sadly that he had not. He said that he had hoped and
      thought he might fetch up again, and be able to send good news. Then he
      had been obliged to abandon that hope, and had finally come home from
      sheer necessity-previously to making a new start. 'Yes, things are very
      bad with me,' he repeated, perceiving their commiserating glances at his
      clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      They brought him nearer the fire, took his hat from his thin hand, which
      was so small and smooth as to show that his attempts to fetch up again had
      not been in a manual direction. His mother resumed her inquiries, and
      dubiously asked if he had chosen to come that particular night for any
      special reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      For no reason, he told her. His arrival had been quite at random. Then
      Philip Hall looked round the room, and saw for the first time that the
      table was laid somewhat luxuriously, and for a larger number than
      themselves; and that an air of festivity pervaded their dress. He asked
      quickly what was going on.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sally is going to be married in a day or two,' replied the mother; and
      she explained how Mr. Darton, Sally's intended husband, was coming there
      that night with the groomsman, Mr. Johns, and other details. 'We thought
      it must be their step when we heard you,' said Mrs. Hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The needy wanderer looked again on the floor. 'I see-I see,' he murmured.
      'Why, indeed, should I have come to-night? Such folk as I are not wanted
      here at these times, naturally. And I have no business here-spoiling other
      people's happiness.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Phil,' said his mother, with a tear in her eye, but with a thinness of
      lip and severity of manner which were presumably not more than past events
      justified; 'since you speak like that to me, I'll speak honestly to you.
      For these three years you have taken no thought for us. You left home with
      a good supply of money, and strength and education, and you ought to have
      made good use of it all. But you come back like a beggar; and that you
      come in a very awkward time for us cannot be denied. Your return to-night
      may do us much harm. But mind-you are welcome to this home as long as it
      is mine. I don't wish to turn you adrift. We will make the best of a bad
      job; and I hope you are not seriously ill?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no. I have only this infernal cough.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him anxiously. 'I think you had better go to bed at once,'
      she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well-I shall be out of the way there,' said the son wearily. 'Having
      ruined myself, don't let me ruin you by being seen in these togs, for
      Heaven's sake. Who do you say Sally is going to be married to-a Farmer
      Darton?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes-a gentleman-farmer-quite a wealthy man. Far better in station than
      she could have expected. It is a good thing, altogether.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well done, little Sal!' said her brother, brightening and looking up at
      her with a smile. 'I ought to have written; but perhaps I have thought of
      you all the more. But let me get out of sight. I would rather go and jump
      into the river than be seen here. But have you anything I can drink? I am
      confoundedly thirsty with my long tramp.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, yes, we will bring something upstairs to you,' said Sally, with
      grief in her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ay, that will do nicely. But, Sally and mother-' He stopped, and they
      waited. 'Mother, I have not told you all,' he resumed slowly, still
      looking on the floor between his knees. 'Sad as what you see of me is,
      there's worse behind.'
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother gazed upon him in grieved suspense, and Sally went and leant
      upon the bureau, listening for every sound, and sighing. Suddenly she
      turned round, saying, 'Let them come, I don't care! Philip, tell the
      worst, and take your time.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, then,' said the unhappy Phil, 'I am not the only one in this mess.
      Would to Heaven I were! But-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, Phil!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have a wife as destitute as I.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A wife?' said his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Unhappily!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A wife! Yes, that is the way with sons!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And besides-' said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Besides! O, Philip, surely-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have two little children.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Wife and children!' whispered Mrs. Hall, sinking down confounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Poor little things!' said Sally involuntarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother turned again to him. 'I suppose these helpless beings are left
      in Australia?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No. They are in England.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I can only hope you've left them in a respectable place.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have not left them at all. They are here-within a few yards of us. In
      short, they are in the stable.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Where?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'In the stable. I did not like to bring them indoors till I had seen you,
      mother, and broken the bad news a bit to you. They were very tired, and
      are resting out there on some straw.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hall's fortitude visibly broke down. She had been brought up not
      without refinement, and was even more moved by such a collapse of genteel
      aims as this than a substantial dairyman's widow would in ordinary have
      been moved. 'Well, it must be borne,' she said, in a low voice, with her
      hands tightly joined. 'A starving son, a starving wife, starving children!
      Let it be. But why is this come to us now, to-day, to-night? Could no
      other misfortune happen to helpless women than this, which will quite
      upset my poor girl's chance of a happy life? Why have you done us this
      wrong, Philip? What respectable man will come here, and marry open-eyed
      into a family of vagabonds?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nonsense, mother!' said Sally vehemently, while her face flushed.
      'Charley isn't the man to desert me. But if he should be, and won't marry
      me because Phil's come, let him go and marry elsewhere. I won't be ashamed
      of my own flesh and blood for any man in England-not I!' And then Sally
      turned away and burst into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Wait till you are twenty years older and you will tell a different tale,'
      replied her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      The son stood up. 'Mother,' he said bitterly, 'as I have come, so I will
      go. All I ask of you is that you will allow me and mine to lie in your
      stable to-night. I give you my word that we'll be gone by break of day,
      and trouble you no further!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hall, the mother, changed at that. 'O no,' she answered hastily;
      'never shall it be said that I sent any of my own family from my door.
      Bring 'em in, Philip, or take me out to them.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'We will put 'em all into the large bedroom,' said Sally, brightening,
      'and make up a large fire. Let's go and help them in, and call Rebekah.'
      (Rebekah was the woman who assisted at the dairy and housework; she lived
      in a cottage hard by with her husband, who attended to the cows.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Sally went to fetch a lantern from the back-kitchen, but her brother said,
      'You won't want a light. I lit the lantern that was hanging there.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What must we call your wife?' asked Mrs. Hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Helena,' said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      With shawls over their heads they proceeded towards the back door.
    </p>
    <p>
      'One minute before you go,' interrupted Philip. 'I-I haven't confessed
      all.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then Heaven help us!' said Mrs. Hall, pushing to the door and clasping
      her hands in calm despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      'We passed through Evershead as we came,' he continued, 'and I just looked
      in at the "Sow-and-Acorn" to see if old Mike still kept on there as usual.
      The carrier had come in from Sherton Abbas at that moment, and guessing
      that I was bound for this place-for I think he knew me-he asked me to
      bring on a dressmaker's parcel for Sally that was marked "immediate." My
      wife had walked on with the children. 'Twas a flimsy parcel, and the paper
      was torn, and I found on looking at it that it was a thick warm gown. I
      didn't wish you to see poor Helena in a shabby state. I was ashamed that
      you should-'twas not what she was born to. I untied the parcel in the
      road, took it on to her where she was waiting in the Lower Barn, and told
      her I had managed to get it for her, and that she was to ask no question.
      She, poor thing, must have supposed I obtained it on trust, through having
      reached a place where I was known, for she put it on gladly enough. She
      has it on now. Sally has other gowns, I daresay.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Sally looked at her mother, speechless.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You have others, I daresay!' repeated Phil, with a sick man's impatience.
      'I thought to myself, "Better Sally cry than Helena freeze." Well, is the
      dress of great consequence? 'Twas nothing very ornamental, as far as I
      could see.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No-no; not of consequence,' returned Sally sadly, adding in a gentle
      voice, 'You will not mind if I lend her another instead of that one, will
      you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip's agitation at the confession had brought on another attack of the
      cough, which seemed to shake him to pieces. He was so obviously unfit to
      sit in a chair that they helped him upstairs at once; and having hastily
      given him a cordial and kindled the bedroom fire, they descended to fetch
      their unhappy new relations.

    <h2>
      III
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was with strange feelings that the girl and her mother, lately so
      cheerful, passed out of the back door into the open air of the barton,
      laden with hay scents and the herby breath of cows. A fine sleet had begun
      to fall, and they trotted across the yard quickly. The stable- door was
      open; a light shone from it-from the lantern which always hung there, and
      which Philip had lighted, as he said. Softly nearing the door, Mrs. Hall
      pronounced the name 'Helena!'
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no answer for the moment. Looking in she was taken by surprise.
      Two people appeared before her. For one, instead of the drabbish woman she
      had expected, Mrs. Hall saw a pale, dark-eyed, ladylike creature, whose
      personality ruled her attire rather than was ruled by it. She was in a new
      and handsome gown, of course, and an old bonnet. She was standing up,
      agitated; her hand was held by her companion-none else than Sally's
      affianced, Farmer Charles Darton, upon whose fine figure the pale
      stranger's eyes were fixed, as his were fixed upon her. His other hand
      held the rein of his horse, which was standing saddled as if just led in.
    </p>
    <p>
      At sight of Mrs. Hall they both turned, looking at her in a way neither
      quite conscious nor unconscious, and without seeming to recollect that
      words were necessary as a solution to the scene. In another moment Sally
      entered also, when Mr. Darton dropped his companion's hand, led the horse
      aside, and came to greet his betrothed and Mrs. Hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah!' he said, smiling-with something like forced composure-'this is a
      roundabout way of arriving, you will say, my dear Mrs. Hall. But we lost
      our way, which made us late. I saw a light here, and led in my horse at
      once-my friend Johns and my man have gone back to the little inn with
      theirs, not to crowd you too much. No sooner had I entered than I saw that
      this lady had taken temporary shelter here-and found I was intruding.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She is my daughter-in-law,' said Mrs. Hall calmly. 'My son, too, is in
      the house, but he has gone to bed unwell.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Sally had stood staring wonderingly at the scene until this moment, hardly
      recognizing Darton's shake of the hand. The spell that bound her was
      broken by her perceiving the two little children seated on a heap of hay.
      She suddenly went forward, spoke to them, and took one on her arm and the
      other in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And two children?' said Mr. Darton, showing thus that he had not been
      there long enough as yet to understand the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My grandchildren,' said Mrs. Hall, with as much affected ease as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip Hall's wife, in spite of this interruption to her first rencounter,
      seemed scarcely so much affected by it as to feel any one's presence in
      addition to Mr. Darton's. However, arousing herself by a quick reflection,
      she threw a sudden critical glance of her sad eyes upon Mrs. Hall; and,
      apparently finding her satisfactory, advanced to her in a meek initiative.
      Then Sally and the stranger spoke some friendly words to each other, and
      Sally went on with the children into the house. Mrs. Hall and Helena
      followed, and Mr. Darton followed these, looking at Helena's dress and
      outline, and listening to her voice like a man in a dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time the others reached the house Sally had already gone upstairs
      with the tired children. She rapped against the wall for Rebekah to come
      in and help to attend to them, Rebekah's house being a little
      'spit-and-dab' cabin leaning against the substantial stone-work of Mrs.
      Hall's taller erection. When she came a bed was made up for the little
      ones, and some supper given to them. On descending the stairs after seeing
      this done Sally went to the sitting-room. Young Mrs. Hall entered it just
      in advance of her, having in the interim retired with her mother-in-law to
      take off her bonnet, and otherwise make herself presentable. Hence it was
      evident that no further communication could have passed between her and
      Mr. Darton since their brief interview in the stable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Japheth Johns now opportunely arrived, and broke up the restraint of
      the company, after a few orthodox meteorological commentaries had passed
      between him and Mrs. Hall by way of introduction. They at once sat down to
      supper, the present of wine and turkey not being produced for consumption
      to-night, lest the premature display of those gifts should seem to throw
      doubt on Mrs. Hall's capacities as a provider.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Drink hearty, Mr. Johns-drink hearty,' said that matron magnanimously.
      'Such as it is there's plenty of. But perhaps cider-wine is not to your
      taste?-though there's body in it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Quite the contrairy, ma'am-quite the contrairy,' said the dairyman. 'For
      though I inherit the malt-liquor principle from my father, I am a
      cider-drinker on my mother's side. She came from these parts, you know.
      And there's this to be said for't-'tis a more peaceful liquor, and don't
      lie about a man like your hotter drinks. With care, one may live on it a
      twelvemonth without knocking down a neighbour, or getting a black eye from
      an old acquaintance.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The general conversation thus begun was continued briskly, though it was
      in the main restricted to Mrs. Hall and Japheth, who in truth required but
      little help from anybody. There being slight call upon Sally's tongue, she
      had ample leisure to do what her heart most desired, namely, watch her
      intended husband and her sister-in-law with a view of elucidating the
      strange momentary scene in which her mother and herself had surprised them
      in the stable. If that scene meant anything, it meant, at least, that they
      had met before. That there had been no time for explanations Sally could
      see, for their manner was still one of suppressed amazement at each
      other's presence there. Darton's eyes, too, fell continually on the gown
      worn by Helena as if this were an added riddle to his perplexity; though
      to Sally it was the one feature in the case which was no mystery. He
      seemed to feel that fate had impishly changed his vis-a-vis in the lover's
      jig he was about to foot; that while the gown had been expected to enclose
      a Sally, a Helena's face looked out from the bodice; that some long-lost
      hand met his own from the sleeves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sally could see that whatever Helena might know of Darton, she knew
      nothing of how the dress entered into his embarrassment. And at moments
      the young girl would have persuaded herself that Darton's looks at her
      sister-in-law were entirely the fruit of the clothes query. But surely at
      other times a more extensive range of speculation and sentiment was
      expressed by her lover's eye than that which the changed dress would
      account for.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sally's independence made her one of the least jealous of women. But there
      was something in the relations of these two visitors which ought to be
      explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Japheth Johns continued to converse in his well-known style, interspersing
      his talk with some private reflections on the position of Darton and
      Sally, which, though the sparkle in his eye showed them to be highly
      entertaining to himself, were apparently not quite communicable to the
      company. At last he withdrew for the night, going off to the roadside inn
      half-a-mile back, whither Darton promised to follow him in a few minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half-an-hour passed, and then Mr. Darton also rose to leave, Sally and her
      sister-in-law simultaneously wishing him good-night as they retired
      upstairs to their rooms. But on his arriving at the front door with Mrs.
      Hall a sharp shower of rain began to come down, when the widow suggested
      that he should return to the fire-side till the storm ceased.
    </p>
    <p>
      Darton accepted her proposal, but insisted that, as it was getting late,
      and she was obviously tired, she should not sit up on his account, since
      he could let himself out of the house, and would quite enjoy smoking a
      pipe by the hearth alone. Mrs. Hall assented; and Darton was left by
      himself. He spread his knees to the brands, lit up his tobacco as he had
      said, and sat gazing into the fire, and at the notches of the
      chimney-crook which hung above.
    </p>
    <p>
      An occasional drop of rain rolled down the chimney with a hiss, and still
      he smoked on; but not like a man whose mind was at rest. In the long run,
      however, despite his meditations, early hours afield and a long ride in
      the open air produced their natural result. He began to doze.
    </p>
    <p>
      How long he remained in this half-unconscious state he did not know. He
      suddenly opened his eyes. The back-brand had burnt itself in two, and
      ceased to flame; the light which he had placed on the mantelpiece had
      nearly gone out. But in spite of these deficiencies there was a light in
      the apartment, and it came from elsewhere. Turning his head he saw Philip
      Hall's wife standing at the entrance of the room with a bed- candle in one
      hand, a small brass tea-kettle in the other, and his gown, as it certainly
      seemed, still upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Helena!' said Darton, starting up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her countenance expressed dismay, and her first words were an apology.
      'I-did not know you were here, Mr. Darton,' she said, while a blush
      flashed to her cheek. 'I thought every one had retired-I was coming to
      make a little water boil; my husband seems to be worse. But perhaps the
      kitchen fire can be lighted up again.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't go on my account. By all means put it on here as you intended,'
      said Darton. 'Allow me to help you.' He went forward to take the kettle
      from her hand, but she did not allow him, and placed it on the fire
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stood some way apart, one on each side of the fireplace, waiting till
      the water should boil, the candle on the mantel between them, and Helena
      with her eyes on the kettle. Darton was the first to break the silence.
      'Shall I call Sally?' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no,' she quickly returned. 'We have given trouble enough already. We
      have no right here. But we are the sport of fate, and were obliged to
      come.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No right here!' said he in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      'None. I can't explain it now,' answered Helena. 'This kettle is very
      slow.'
    </p>
    <p>
      There was another pause; the proverbial dilatoriness of watched pots was
      never more clearly exemplified.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helena's face was of that sort which seems to ask for assistance without
      the owner's knowledge-the very antipodes of Sally's, which was self-
      reliance expressed. Darton's eyes travelled from the kettle to Helena's
      face, then back to the kettle, then to the face for rather a longer time.
      'So I am not to know anything of the mystery that has distracted me all
      the evening?' he said. 'How is it that a woman, who refused me because (as
      I supposed) my position was not good enough for her taste, is found to be
      the wife of a man who certainly seems to be worse off than I?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He had the prior claim,' said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What! you knew him at that time?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, yes! Please say no more,' she implored.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Whatever my errors, I have paid for them during the last five years!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The heart of Darton was subject to sudden overflowings. He was kind to a
      fault. 'I am sorry from my soul,' he said, involuntarily approaching her.
      Helena withdrew a step or two, at which he became conscious of his
      movement, and quickly took his former place. Here he stood without
      speaking, and the little kettle began to sing.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, you might have been my wife if you had chosen,' he said at last.
      'But that's all past and gone. However, if you are in any trouble or
      poverty I shall be glad to be of service, and as your relation by marriage
      I shall have a right to be. Does your uncle know of your distress?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'My uncle is dead. He left me without a farthing. And now we have two
      children to maintain.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What, left you nothing? How could he be so cruel as that?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I disgraced myself in his eyes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now,' said Darton earnestly, 'let me take care of the children, at least
      while you are so unsettled. You belong to another, so I cannot take care
      of you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes you can,' said a voice; and suddenly a third figure stood beside
      them. It was Sally. 'You can, since you seem to wish to?' she repeated.
      'She no longer belongs to another . . . My poor brother is dead!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face was red, her eyes sparkled, and all the woman came to the front.
      'I have heard it!' she went on to him passionately. 'You can protect her
      now as well as the children!' She turned then to her agitated
      sister-in-law. 'I heard something,' said Sally (in a gentle murmur,
      differing much from her previous passionate words), 'and I went into his
      room. It must have been the moment you left. He went off so quickly, and
      weakly, and it was so unexpected, that I couldn't leave even to call you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Darton was just able to gather from the confused discourse which followed
      that, during his sleep by the fire, this brother whom he had never seen
      had become worse; and that during Helena's absence for water the end had
      unexpectedly come. The two young women hastened upstairs, and he was again
      left alone.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      After standing there a short time he went to the front door and looked
      out; till, softly closing it behind him, he advanced and stood under the
      large sycamore-tree. The stars were flickering coldly, and the dampness
      which had just descended upon the earth in rain now sent up a chill from
      it. Darton was in a strange position, and he felt it. The unexpected
      appearance, in deep poverty, of Helena-a young lady, daughter of a
      deceased naval officer, who had been brought up by her uncle, a solicitor,
      and had refused Darton in marriage years ago-the passionate, almost angry
      demeanour of Sally at discovering them, the abrupt announcement that
      Helena was a widow; all this coming together was a conjuncture difficult
      to cope with in a moment, and made him question whether he ought to leave
      the house or offer assistance. But for Sally's manner he would
      unhesitatingly have done the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was still standing under the tree when the door in front of him opened,
      and Mrs. Hall came out. She went round to the garden-gate at the side
      without seeing him. Darton followed her, intending to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pausing outside, as if in thought, she proceeded to a spot where the sun
      came earliest in spring-time, and where the north wind never blew; it was
      where the row of beehives stood under the wall. Discerning her object, he
      waited till she had accomplished it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the universal custom thereabout to wake the bees by tapping at
      their hives whenever a death occurred in the household, under the belief
      that if this were not done the bees themselves would pine away and perish
      during the ensuing year. As soon as an interior buzzing responded to her
      tap at the first hive Mrs. Hall went on to the second, and thus passed
      down the row. As soon as she came back he met her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What can I do in this trouble, Mrs. Hall?' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O-nothing, thank you, nothing,' she said in a tearful voice, now just
      perceiving him. 'We have called Rebekah and her husband, and they will do
      everything necessary.' She told him in a few words the particulars of her
      son's arrival, broken in health-indeed, at death's very door, though they
      did not suspect it-and suggested, as the result of a conversation between
      her and her daughter, that the wedding should be postponed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, of course,' said Darton. 'I think now to go straight to the inn and
      tell Johns what has happened.' It was not till after he had shaken hands
      with her that he turned hesitatingly and added, 'Will you tell the mother
      of his children that, as they are now left fatherless, I shall be glad to
      take the eldest of them, if it would be any convenience to her and to
      you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hall promised that her son's widow should he told of the offer, and
      they parted. He retired down the rooty slope and disappeared in the
      direction of the inn, where he informed Johns of the circumstances.
      Meanwhile Mrs. Hall had entered the house, Sally was downstairs in the
      sitting-room alone, and her mother explained to her that Darton had
      readily assented to the postponement.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No doubt he has,' said Sally, with sad emphasis. 'It is not put off for a
      week, or a month, or a year. I shall never marry him, and she will!'

      IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Time passed, and the household on the Knap became again serene under the
      composing influences of daily routine. A desultory, very desultory
      correspondence, dragged on between Sally Hall and Darton, who, not quite
      knowing how to take her petulant words on the night of her brother's
      death, had continued passive thus long. Helena and her children remained
      at the dairy-house, almost of necessity, and Darton therefore deemed it
      advisable to stay away.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, seven months later on, when Mr. Darton was as usual at his farm,
      twenty miles from Hintock, a note reached him from Helena. She thanked him
      for his kind offer about her children, which her mother-in- law had duly
      communicated, and stated that she would be glad to accept it as regarded
      the eldest, the boy. Helena had, in truth, good need to do so, for her
      uncle had left her penniless, and all application to some relatives in the
      north had failed. There was, besides, as she said, no good school near
      Hintock to which she could send the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a fine summer day the boy came. He was accompanied half-way by Sally
      and his mother-to the 'White Horse,' at Chalk Newton-where he was handed
      over to Darton's bailiff in a shining spring-cart, who met them there.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was entered as a day-scholar at a popular school at Casterbridge, three
      or four miles from Darton's, having first been taught by Darton to ride a
      forest-pony, on which he cantered to and from the aforesaid fount of
      knowledge, and (as Darton hoped) brought away a promising headful of the
      same at each diurnal expedition. The thoughtful taciturnity into which
      Darton had latterly fallen was quite dissipated by the presence of this
      boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Christmas holidays came it was arranged that he should spend them
      with his mother. The journey was, for some reason or other, performed in
      two stages, as at his coming, except that Darton in person took the place
      of the bailiff, and that the boy and himself rode on horseback.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reaching the renowned 'White Horse,' Darton inquired if Miss and young
      Mrs. Hall were there to meet little Philip (as they had agreed to be). He
      was answered by the appearance of Helena alone at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      'At the last moment Sally would not come,' she faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      That meeting practically settled the point towards which these long-
      severed persons were converging. But nothing was broached about it for
      some time yet. Sally Hall had, in fact, imparted the first decisive motion
      to events by refusing to accompany Helena. She soon gave them a second
      move by writing the following note
    </p>
    <p>
      '[Private.]
    </p>
    <p>
      'DEAR CHARLES,-Living here so long and intimately with Helena, I have
      naturally learnt her history, especially that of it which refers to you. I
      am sure she would accept you as a husband at the proper time, and I think
      you ought to give her the opportunity. You inquire in an old note if I am
      sorry that I showed temper (which it wasn't) that night when I heard you
      talking to her. No, Charles, I am not sorry at all for what I said
      then.-Yours sincerely, SALLY HALL.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus set in train, the transfer of Darton's heart back to its original
      quarters proceeded by mere lapse of time. In the following July, Darton
      went to his friend Japheth to ask him at last to fulfil the bridal office
      which had been in abeyance since the previous January twelvemonths.
    </p>
    <p>
      'With all my heart, man o' constancy!' said Dairyman Johns warmly. 'I've
      lost most of my genteel fair complexion haymaking this hot weather, 'tis
      true, but I'll do your business as well as them that look better. There be
      scents and good hair-oil in the world yet, thank God, and they'll take off
      the roughest o' my edge. I'll compliment her. "Better late than never,
      Sally Hall," I'll say.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is not Sally,' said Darton hurriedly. 'It is young Mrs. Hall.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Japheth's face, as soon as he really comprehended, became a picture of
      reproachful dismay. 'Not Sally?' he said. 'Why not Sally? I can't believe
      it! Young Mrs. Hall! Well, well-where's your wisdom?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Darton shortly explained particulars; but Johns would not be reconciled.
      'She was a woman worth having if ever woman was,' he cried. 'And now to
      let her go!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But I suppose I can marry where I like,' said Darton.
    </p>
    <p>
      'H'm,' replied the dairyman, lifting his eyebrows expressively. 'This
      don't become you, Charles-it really do not. If I had done such a thing you
      would have sworn I was a curst no'thern fool to be drawn off the scent by
      such a red-herring doll-oll-oll.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Farmer Darton responded in such sharp terms to this laconic opinion that
      the two friends finally parted in a way they had never parted before.
      Johns was to be no groomsman to Darton after all. He had flatly declined.
      Darton went off sorry, and even unhappy, particularly as Japheth was about
      to leave that side of the county, so that the words which had divided them
      were not likely to be explained away or softened down.
    </p>
    <p>
      A short time after the interview Darton was united to Helena at a simple
      matter-of fact wedding; and she and her little girl joined the boy who had
      already grown to look on Darton's house as home.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some months the farmer experienced an unprecedented happiness and
      satisfaction. There had been a flaw in his life, and it was as neatly
      mended as was humanly possible. But after a season the stream of events
      followed less clearly, and there were shades in his reveries. Helena was a
      fragile woman, of little staying power, physically or morally, and since
      the time that he had originally known her-eight or ten years before-she
      had been severely tried. She had loved herself out, in short, and was now
      occasionally given to moping. Sometimes she spoke regretfully of the
      gentilities of her early life, and instead of comparing her present state
      with her condition as the wife of the unlucky Hall, she mused rather on
      what it had been before she took the first fatal step of clandestinely
      marrying him. She did not care to please such people as those with whom
      she was thrown as a thriving farmer's wife. She allowed the pretty trifles
      of agricultural domesticity to glide by her as sorry details, and had it
      not been for the children Darton's house would have seemed but little
      brighter than it had been before.
    </p>
    <p>
      This led to occasional unpleasantness, until Darton sometimes declared to
      himself that such endeavours as his to rectify early deviations of the
      heart by harking back to the old point mostly failed of success. 'Perhaps
      Johns was right,' he would say. 'I should have gone on with Sally. Better
      go with the tide and make the best of its course than stem it at the risk
      of a capsize.' But he kept these unmelodious thoughts to himself, and was
      outwardly considerate and kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      This somewhat barren tract of his life had extended to less than a year
      and a half when his ponderings were cut short by the loss of the woman
      they concerned. When she was in her grave he thought better of her than
      when she had been alive; the farm was a worse place without her than with
      her, after all. No woman short of divine could have gone through such an
      experience as hers with her first husband without becoming a little
      soured. Her stagnant sympathies, her sometimes unreasonable manner, had
      covered a heart frank and well meaning, and originally hopeful and warm.
      She left him a tiny red infant in white wrappings. To make life as easy as
      possible to this touching object became at once his care.
    </p>
    <p>
      As this child learnt to walk and talk Darton learnt to see feasibility in
      a scheme which pleased him. Revolving the experiment which he had hitherto
      made upon life, he fancied he had gained wisdom from his mistakes and
      caution from his miscarriages.
    </p>
    <p>
      What the scheme was needs no penetration to discover. Once more he had
      opportunity to recast and rectify his ill-wrought situations by returning
      to Sally Hall, who still lived quietly on under her mother's roof at
      Hintock. Helena had been a woman to lend pathos and refinement to a home;
      Sally was the woman to brighten it. She would not, as Helena did, despise
      the rural simplicities of a farmer's fireside. Moreover, she had a
      pre-eminent qualification for Darton's household; no other woman could
      make so desirable a mother to her brother's two children and Darton's one
      as Sally-while Darton, now that Helena had gone, was a more promising
      husband for Sally than he had ever been when liable to reminders from an
      uncured sentimental wound.
    </p>
    <p>
      Darton was not a man to act rapidly, and the working out of his reparative
      designs might have been delayed for some time. But there came a winter
      evening precisely like the one which had darkened over that former ride to
      Hintock, and he asked himself why he should postpone longer, when the very
      landscape called for a repetition of that attempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      He told his man to saddle the mare, booted and spurred himself with a
      younger horseman's nicety, kissed the two youngest children, and rode off.
      To make the journey a complete parallel to the first, he would fain have
      had his old acquaintance Japheth Johns with him. But Johns, alas! was
      missing. His removal to the other side of the county had left unrepaired
      the breach which had arisen between him and Darton; and though Darton had
      forgiven him a hundred times, as Johns had probably forgiven Darton, the
      effort of reunion in present circumstances was one not likely to be made.
    </p>
    <p>
      He screwed himself up to as cheerful a pitch as he could without his
      former crony, and became content with his own thoughts as he rode, instead
      of the words of a companion. The sun went down; the boughs appeared
      scratched in like an etching against the sky; old crooked men with faggots
      at their backs said 'Good-night, sir,' and Darton replied 'Good-night'
      right heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time he reached the forking roads it was getting as dark as it had
      been on the occasion when Johns climbed the directing-post. Darton made no
      mistake this time. 'Nor shall I be able to mistake, thank Heaven, when I
      arrive,' he murmured. It gave him peculiar satisfaction to think that the
      proposed marriage, like his first, was of the nature of setting in order
      things long awry, and not a momentary freak of fancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing hindered the smoothness of his journey, which seemed not half its
      former length. Though dark, it was only between five and six o'clock when
      the bulky chimneys of Mrs. Hall's residence appeared in view behind the
      sycamore-tree. On second thoughts he retreated and put up at the ale-house
      as in former time; and when he had plumed himself before the inn mirror,
      called for something to drink, and smoothed out the incipient wrinkles of
      care, he walked on to the Knap with a quick step.

    <p>
      That evening Sally was making 'pinners' for the milkers, who were now
      increased by two, for her mother and herself no longer joined in milking
      the cows themselves. But upon the whole there was little change in the
      household economy, and not much in its appearance, beyond such minor
      particulars as that the crack over the window, which had been a hundred
      years coming, was a trifle wider; that the beams were a shade blacker;
      that the influence of modernism had supplanted the open chimney corner by
      a grate; that Rebekah, who had worn a cap when she had plenty of hair, had
      left it off now she had scarce any, because it was reported that caps were
      not fashionable; and that Sally's face had naturally assumed a more
      womanly and experienced cast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hall was actually lifting coals with the tongs, as she had used to
      do.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Five years ago this very night, if I am not mistaken-' she said, laying
      on an ember.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not this very night-though 'twas one night this week,' said the correct
      Sally.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, 'tis near enough. Five years ago Mr. Darton came to marry you, and
      my poor boy Phil came home to die.' She sighed. 'Ah, Sally,' she presently
      said, 'if you had managed well Mr. Darton would have had you, Helena or
      none.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't be sentimental about that, mother,' begged Sally. 'I didn't care to
      manage well in such a case. Though I liked him, I wasn't so anxious. I
      would never have married the man in the midst of such a hitch as that
      was,' she added with decision; 'and I don't think I would if he were to
      ask me now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am not sure about that, unless you have another in your eye.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I wouldn't; and I'll tell you why. I could hardly marry him for love at
      this time o' day. And as we've quite enough to live on if we give up the
      dairy to-morrow, I should have no need to marry for any meaner reason . .
      . I am quite happy enough as I am, and there's an end of it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it was not long after this dialogue that there came a mild rap at the
      door, and in a moment there entered Rebekah, looking as though a ghost had
      arrived. The fact was that that accomplished skimmer and churner (now a
      resident in the house) had overheard the desultory observations between
      mother and daughter, and on opening the door to Mr. Darton thought the
      coincidence must have a grisly meaning in it. Mrs. Hall welcomed the
      farmer with warm surprise, as did Sally, and for a moment they rather
      wanted words.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Can you push up the chimney-crook for me, Mr Darton? the notches hitch,'
      said the matron. He did it, and the homely little act bridged over the
      awkward consciousness that he had been a stranger for four years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hall soon saw what he had come for, and left the principals together
      while she went to prepare him a late tea, smiling at Sally's recent hasty
      assertions of indifference, when she saw how civil Sally was. When tea was
      ready she joined them. She fancied that Darton did not look so confident
      as when he had arrived; but Sally was quite light- hearted, and the meal
      passed pleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      About seven he took his leave of them. Mrs. Hall went as far as the door
      to light him down the slope. On the doorstep he said frankly-'I came to
      ask your daughter to marry me; chose the night and everything, with an eye
      to a favourable answer. But she won't.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then she's a very ungrateful girl!' emphatically said Mrs. Hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Darton paused to shape his sentence, and asked, 'I-I suppose there's
      nobody else more favoured?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I can't say that there is, or that there isn't,' answered Mrs. Hall.
      'She's private in some things. I'm on your side, however, Mr. Darton, and
      I'll talk to her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Thank 'ee, thank 'ee!' said the farmer in a gayer accent; and with this
      assurance the not very satisfactory visit came to an end. Darton descended
      the roots of the sycamore, the light was withdrawn, and the door closed.
      At the bottom of the slope he nearly ran against a man about to ascend.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Can a jack-o'-lent believe his few senses on such a dark night, or can't
      he?' exclaimed one whose utterance Darton recognized in a moment, despite
      its unexpectedness. 'I dare not swear he can, though I fain would!' The
      speaker was Johns.
    </p>
    <p>
      Darton said he was glad of this opportunity, bad as it was, of putting an
      end to the silence of years, and asked the dairyman what he was travelling
      that way for.
    </p>
    <p>
      Japheth showed the old jovial confidence in a moment. 'I'm going to see
      your-relations-as they always seem to me,' he said-'Mrs. Hall and Sally.
      Well, Charles, the fact is I find the natural barbarousness of man is much
      increased by a bachelor life, and, as your leavings were always good
      enough for me, I'm trying civilization here.' He nodded towards the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not with Sally-to marry her?' said Darton, feeling something like a rill
      of ice water between his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, by the help of Providence and my personal charms. And I think I
      shall get her. I am this road every week-my present dairy is only four
      miles off, you know, and I see her through the window. 'Tis rather odd
      that I was going to speak practical to-night to her for the first time.
      You've just called?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, for a short while. But she didn't say a word about you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A good sign, a good sign. Now that decides me. I'll swing the mallet and
      get her answer this very night as I planned.'
    </p>
    <p>
      A few more remarks, and Darton, wishing his friend joy of Sally in a
      slightly hollow tone of jocularity, bade him good-bye. Johns promised to
      write particulars, and ascended, and was lost in the shade of the house
      and tree. A rectangle of light appeared when Johns was admitted, and all
      was dark again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Happy Japheth!' said Darton. 'This then is the explanation!'
    </p>
    <p>
      He determined to return home that night. In a quarter of an hour he passed
      out of the village, and the next day went about his swede-lifting and
      storing as if nothing had occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited and waited to hear from Johns whether the wedding-day was fixed:
      but no letter came. He learnt not a single particular till, meeting Johns
      one day at a horse-auction, Darton exclaimed genially-rather more genially
      than he felt-'When is the joyful day to be?'
    </p>
    <p>
      To his great surprise a reciprocity of gladness was not conspicuous in
      Johns. 'Not at all,' he said, in a very subdued tone. ''Tis a bad job; she
      won't have me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Darton held his breath till he said with treacherous solicitude, 'Try
      again-'tis coyness.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no,' said Johns decisively. 'There's been none of that. We talked it
      over dozens of times in the most fair and square way. She tells me
      plainly, I don't suit her. 'Twould be simply annoying her to ask her
      again. Ah, Charles, you threw a prize away when you let her slip five
      years ago.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I did-I did,' said Darton.
    </p>
    <p>
      He returned from that auction with a new set of feelings in play. He had
      certainly made a surprising mistake in thinking Johns his successful
      rival. It really seemed as if he might hope for Sally after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time, being rather pressed by business, Darton had recourse to pen-
      and-ink, and wrote her as manly and straightforward a proposal as any
      woman could wish to receive. The reply came promptly:-
    </p>
    <p>
      'DEAR MR. DARTON,-I am as sensible as any woman can be of the goodness
      that leads you to make me this offer a second time. Better women than I
      would be proud of the honour, for when I read your nice long speeches on
      mangold-wurzel, and such like topics, at the Casterbridge Farmers' Club, I
      do feel it an honour, I assure you. But my answer is just the same as
      before. I will not try to explain what, in truth, I cannot explain-my
      reasons; I will simply say that I must decline to be married to you. With
      good wishes as in former times, I am, your faithful friend,
    </p>
    <h3>
      'SALLY HALL.'
    </h3>
    <p>
      Darton dropped the letter hopelessly. Beyond the negative, there was just
      a possibility of sarcasm in it-'nice long speeches on mangold- wurzel' had
      a suspicious sound. However, sarcasm or none, there was the answer, and he
      had to be content.
    </p>
    <p>
      He proceeded to seek relief in a business which at this time engrossed
      much of his attention-that of clearing up a curious mistake just current
      in the county, that he had been nearly ruined by the recent failure of a
      local bank. A farmer named Darton had lost heavily, and the similarity of
      name had probably led to the error. Belief in it was so persistent that it
      demanded several days of letter-writing to set matters straight, and
      persuade the world that he was as solvent as ever he had been in his life.
      He had hardly concluded this worrying task when, to his delight, another
      letter arrived in the handwriting of Sally.
    </p>
    <p>
      Darton tore it open; it was very short.
    </p>
    <p>
      'DEAR MR. DARTON,-We have been so alarmed these last few days by the
      report that you were ruined by the stoppage of &mdash;'s Bank, that, now
      it is contradicted I hasten, by my mother's wish, to say how truly glad we
      are to find there is no foundation for the report. After your kindness to
      my poor brother's children, I can do no less than write at such a moment.
      We had a letter from each of them a few days ago.-Your faithful friend,
    </p>
    <h3>
      'SALLY HALL.'
    </h3>
    <p>
      'Mercenary little woman!' said Darton to himself with a smile. 'Then that
      was the secret of her refusal this time-she thought I was ruined.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, such was Darton, that as hours went on he could not help feeling too
      generously towards Sally to condemn her in this. What did he want in a
      wife? he asked himself. Love and integrity. What next? Worldly wisdom. And
      was there really more than worldly wisdom in her refusal to go aboard a
      sinking ship? She now knew it was otherwise. 'Begad,' he said, 'I'll try
      her again.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact was he had so set his heart upon Sally, and Sally alone, that
      nothing was to be allowed to baulk him; and his reasoning was purely
      formal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anniversaries having been unpropitious, he waited on till a bright day
      late in May-a day when all animate nature was fancying, in its trusting,
      foolish way, that it was going to bask out of doors for evermore. As he
      rode through Long-Ash Lane it was scarce recognizable as the track of his
      two winter journeys. No mistake could be made now, even with his eyes
      shut. The cuckoo's note was at its best, between April tentativeness and
      midsummer decrepitude, and the reptiles in the sun behaved as winningly as
      kittens on a hearth. Though afternoon, and about the same time as on the
      last occasion, it was broad day and sunshine when he entered Hintock, and
      the details of the Knap dairy- house were visible far up the road. He saw
      Sally in the garden, and was set vibrating. He had first intended to go on
      to the inn; but 'No,' he said; 'I'll tie my horse to the garden-gate. If
      all goes well it can soon be taken round: if not, I mount and ride away'
    </p>
    <p>
      The tall shade of the horseman darkened the room in which Mrs. Hall sat,
      and made her start, for he had ridden by a side path to the top of the
      slope, where riders seldom came. In a few seconds he was in the garden
      with Sally.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five-ay, three minutes-did the business at the back of that row of bees.
      Though spring had come, and heavenly blue consecrated the scene, Darton
      succeeded not. 'No,' said Sally firmly. 'I will never, never marry you,
      Mr. Darton. I would have done it once; but now I never can.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But!'-implored Mr. Darton. And with a burst of real eloquence he went on
      to declare all sorts of things that he would do for her. He would drive
      her to see her mother every week-take her to London-settle so much money
      upon her-Heaven knows what he did not promise, suggest, and tempt her
      with. But it availed nothing. She interposed with a stout negative, which
      closed the course of his argument like an iron gate across a highway.
      Darton paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then,' said he simply, 'you hadn't heard of my supposed failure when you
      declined last time?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I had not,' she said. 'But if I had 'twould have been all the same.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And 'tis not because of any soreness from my slighting you years ago?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No. That soreness is long past.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah-then you despise me, Sally?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No,' she slowly answered. 'I don't altogether despise you. I don't think
      you quite such a hero as I once did-that's all. The truth is, I am happy
      enough as I am; and I don't mean to marry at all. Now, may I ask a favour,
      sir?' She spoke with an ineffable charm, which, whenever he thought of it,
      made him curse his loss of her as long as he lived.
    </p>
    <p>
      'To any extent.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Please do not put this question to me any more. Friends as long as you
      like, but lovers and married never.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I never will,' said Darton. 'Not if I live a hundred years.'
    </p>
    <p>
      And he never did. That he had worn out his welcome in her heart was only
      too plain.
    </p>
    <p>
      When his step-children had grown up, and were placed out in life, all
      communication between Darton and the Hall family ceased. It was only by
      chance that, years after, he learnt that Sally, notwithstanding the
      solicitations her attractions drew down upon her, had refused several
      offers of marriage, and steadily adhered to her purpose of leading a
      single life

    <h2>
      I-HOW HIS COLD WAS CURED
    </h2>
    <p>
      Something delayed the arrival of the Wesleyan minister, and a young man
      came temporarily in his stead. It was on the thirteenth of January 183-
      that Mr. Stockdale, the young man in question, made his humble entry into
      the village, unknown, and almost unseen. But when those of the inhabitants
      who styled themselves of his connection became acquainted with him, they
      were rather pleased with the substitute than otherwise, though he had
      scarcely as yet acquired ballast of character sufficient to steady the
      consciences of the hundred-and-forty Methodists of pure blood who, at this
      time, lived in Nether-Moynton, and to give in addition supplementary
      support to the mixed race which went to church in the morning and chapel
      in the evening, or when there was a tea-as many as a hundred-and-ten
      people more, all told, and including the parish- clerk in the winter-time,
      when it was too dark for the vicar to observe who passed up the street at
      seven o'clock-which, to be just to him, he was never anxious to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was owing to this overlapping of creeds that the celebrated
      population-puzzle arose among the denser gentry of the district around
      Nether-Moynton: how could it be that a parish containing fifteen score of
      strong full-grown Episcopalians, and nearly thirteen score of well-
      matured Dissenters, numbered barely two-and-twenty score adults in all?
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man being personally interesting, those with whom he came in
      contact were content to waive for a while the graver question of his
      sufficiency. It is said that at this time of his life his eyes were
      affectionate, though without a ray of levity; that his hair was curly, and
      his figure tall; that he was, in short, a very lovable youth, who won upon
      his female hearers as soon as they saw and heard him, and caused them to
      say, 'Why didn't we know of this before he came, that we might have gied
      him a warmer welcome!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact was that, knowing him to be only provisionally selected, and
      expecting nothing remarkable in his person or doctrine, they and the rest
      of his flock in Nether-Moynton had felt almost as indifferent about his
      advent as if they had been the soundest church-going parishioners in the
      country, and he their true and appointed parson. Thus when Stockdale set
      foot in the place nobody had secured a lodging for him, and though his
      journey had given him a bad cold in the head, he was forced to attend to
      that business himself. On inquiry he learnt that the only possible
      accommodation in the village would be found at the house of one Mrs. Lizzy
      Newberry, at the upper end of the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a youth who gave this information, and Stockdale asked him who Mrs.
      Newberry might be.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy said that she was a widow-woman, who had got no husband, because
      he was dead. Mr. Newberry, he added, had been a well-to-do man enough, as
      the saying was, and a farmer; but he had gone off in a decline. As
      regarded Mrs. Newberry's serious side, Stockdale gathered that she was one
      of the trimmers who went to church and chapel both.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll go there,' said Stockdale, feeling that, in the absence of purely
      sectarian lodgings, he could do no better.
    </p>
    <p>
      'She's a little particular, and won't hae gover'ment folks, or curates, or
      the pa'son's friends, or such like,' said the lad dubiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, that may be a promising sign: I'll call. Or no; just you go up and
      ask first if she can find room for me. I have to see one or two persons on
      another matter. You will find me down at the carrier's.'
    </p>
    <p>
      In a quarter of an hour the lad came back, and said that Mrs. Newberry
      would have no objection to accommodate him, whereupon Stockdale called at
      the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      It stood within a garden-hedge, and seemed to be roomy and comfortable. He
      saw an elderly woman, with whom he made arrangements to come the same
      night, since there was no inn in the place, and he wished to house himself
      as soon as possible; the village being a local centre from which he was to
      radiate at once to the different small chapels in the neighbourhood. He
      forthwith sent his luggage to Mrs. Newberry's from the carrier's, where he
      had taken shelter, and in the evening walked up to his temporary home.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he now lived there, Stockdale felt it unnecessary to knock at the door;
      and entering quietly he had the pleasure of hearing footsteps scudding
      away like mice into the back quarters. He advanced to the parlour, as the
      front room was called, though its stone floor was scarcely disguised by
      the carpet, which only over-laid the trodden areas, leaving sandy deserts
      under the bulging mouldings of the table- legs, playing with brass
      furniture. But the room looked snug and cheerful. The firelight shone out
      brightly, trembling on the knobs and handles, and lurking in great
      strength on the under surface of the chimney-piece. A deep arm-chair,
      covered with horsehair, and studded with a countless throng of brass
      nails, was pulled up on one side of the fireplace. The tea-things were on
      the table, the teapot cover was open, and a little hand-bell had been laid
      at that precise point towards which a person seated in the great chair
      might be expected instinctively to stretch his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stockdale sat down, not objecting to his experience of the room thus far,
      and began his residence by tinkling the bell. A little girl crept in at
      the summons, and made tea for him. Her name, she said, was Marther Sarer,
      and she lived out there, nodding towards the road and village generally.
      Before Stockdale had got far with his meal, a tap sounded on the door
      behind him, and on his telling the inquirer to come in, a rustle of
      garments caused him to turn his head. He saw before him a fine and
      extremely well-made young woman, with dark hair, a wide, sensible,
      beautiful forehead, eyes that warmed him before he knew it, and a mouth
      that was in itself a picture to all appreciative souls.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Can I get you anything else for tea?' she said, coming forward a step or
      two, an expression of liveliness on her features, and her hand waving the
      door by its edge.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nothing, thank you,' said Stockdale, thinking less of what he replied
      than of what might be her relation to the household.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are quite sure?' said the young woman, apparently aware that he had
      not considered his answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      He conscientiously examined the tea-things, and found them all there.
      'Quite sure, Miss Newberry,' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is Mrs. Newberry,' she said. 'Lizzy Newberry, I used to be Lizzy
      Simpkins.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, I beg your pardon, Mrs. Newberry.' And before he had occasion to say
      more she left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stockdale remained in some doubt till Martha Sarah came to clear the
      table. 'Whose house is this, my little woman,' said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mrs. Lizzy Newberry's, sir.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then Mrs. Newberry is not the old lady I saw this afternoon?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No. That's Mrs. Newberry's mother. It was Mrs. Newberry who comed in to
      you just by now, because she wanted to see if you was good-looking.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Later in the evening, when Stockdale was about to begin supper, she came
      again. 'I have come myself, Mr. Stockdale,' she said. The minister stood
      up in acknowledgment of the honour. 'I am afraid little Marther might not
      make you understand. What will you have for supper?-there's cold rabbit,
      and there's a ham uncut.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Stockdale said he could get on nicely with those viands, and supper was
      laid. He had no more than cut a slice when tap-tap came to the door again.
      The minister had already learnt that this particular rhythm in taps
      denoted the fingers of his enkindling landlady, and the doomed young
      fellow buried his first mouthful under a look of receptive blandness.
    </p>
    <p>
      'We have a chicken in the house, Mr. Stockdale-I quite forgot to mention
      it just now. Perhaps you would like Marther Sarer to bring it up?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Stockdale had advanced far enough in the art of being a young man to say
      that he did not want the chicken, unless she brought it up herself; but
      when it was uttered he blushed at the daring gallantry of the speech,
      perhaps a shade too strong for a serious man and a minister. In three
      minutes the chicken appeared, but, to his great surprise, only in the
      hands of Martha Sarah. Stockdale was disappointed, which perhaps it was
      intended that he should be.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had finished supper, and was not in the least anticipating Mrs.
      Newberry again that night, when she tapped and entered as before.
      Stockdale's gratified look told that she had lost nothing by not appearing
      when expected. It happened that the cold in the head from which the young
      man suffered had increased with the approach of night, and before she had
      spoken he was seized with a violent fit of sneezing which he could not
      anyhow repress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Newberry looked full of pity. 'Your cold is very bad to-night, Mr.
      Stockdale.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Stockdale replied that it was rather troublesome.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And I've a good mind'-she added archly, looking at the cheerless glass of
      water on the table, which the abstemious minister was going to drink.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, Mrs. Newberry?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I've a good mind that you should have something more likely to cure it
      than that cold stuff.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well,' said Stockdale, looking down at the glass, 'as there is no inn
      here, and nothing better to be got in the village, of course it will do.'
    </p>
    <p>
      To this she replied, 'There is something better, not far off, though not
      in the house. I really think you must try it, or you may be ill. Yes, Mr.
      Stockdale, you shall.' She held up her finger, seeing that he was about to
      speak. 'Don't ask what it is; wait, and you shall see.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lizzy went away, and Stockdale waited in a pleasant mood. Presently she
      returned with her bonnet and cloak on, saying, 'I am so sorry, but you
      must help me to get it. Mother has gone to bed. Will you wrap yourself up,
      and come this way, and please bring that cup with you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Stockdale, a lonely young fellow, who had for weeks felt a great craving
      for somebody on whom to throw away superfluous interest, and even
      tenderness, was not sorry to join her; and followed his guide through the
      back door, across the garden, to the bottom, where the boundary was a
      wall. This wall was low, and beyond it Stockdale discerned in the night
      shades several grey headstones, and the outlines of the church roof and
      tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is easy to get up this way,' she said, stepping upon a bank which
      abutted on the wall; then putting her foot on the top of the stonework,
      and descending a spring inside, where the ground was much higher, as is
      the manner of graveyards to be. Stockdale did the same, and followed her
      in the dusk across the irregular ground till they came to the tower door,
      which, when they had entered, she softly closed behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You can keep a secret?' she said, in a musical voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Like an iron chest!' said he fervently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then from under her cloak she produced a small lighted lantern, which the
      minister had not noticed that she carried at all. The light showed them to
      be close to the singing-gallery stairs, under which lay a heap of lumber
      of all sorts, but consisting mostly of decayed framework, pews, panels,
      and pieces of flooring, that from time to time had been removed from their
      original fixings in the body of the edifice and replaced by new.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Perhaps you will drag some of those boards aside?' she said, holding the
      lantern over her head to light him better. 'Or will you take the lantern
      while I move them?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I can manage it,' said the young man, and acting as she ordered, he
      uncovered, to his surprise, a row of little barrels bound with wood hoops,
      each barrel being about as large as the nave of a heavy waggon- wheel.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they were laid open Lizzy fixed her eyes on him, as if she wondered
      what he would say.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You know what they are?' she asked, finding that he did not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, barrels,' said Stockdale simply. He was an inland man, the son of
      highly respectable parents, and brought up with a single eye to the
      ministry; and the sight suggested nothing beyond the fact that such
      articles were there.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are quite right, they are barrels,' she said, in an emphatic tone of
      candour that was not without a touch of irony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stockdale looked at her with an eye of sudden misgiving. 'Not smugglers'
      liquor?' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' said she. 'They are tubs of spirit that have accidentally come over
      in the dark from France.'
    </p>
    <p>
      In Nether-Moynton and its vicinity at this date people always smiled at
      the sort of sin called in the outside world illicit trading; and these
      little kegs of gin and brandy were as well known to the inhabitants as
      turnips. So that Stockdale's innocent ignorance, and his look of alarm
      when he guessed the sinister mystery, seemed to strike Lizzy first as
      ludicrous, and then as very awkward for the good impression that she
      wished to produce upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Smuggling is carried on here by some of the people,' she said in a
      gentle, apologetic voice. 'It has been their practice for generations, and
      they think it no harm. Now, will you roll out one of the tubs?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What to do with it?' said the minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      'To draw a little from it to cure your cold,' she answered. 'It is so
      'nation strong that it drives away that sort of thing in a jiffy. O, it is
      all right about our taking it. I may have what I like; the owner of the
      tubs says so. I ought to have had some in the house, and then I shouldn't
      ha' been put to this trouble; but I drink none myself, and so I often
      forget to keep it indoors.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are allowed to help yourself, I suppose, that you may not inform
      where their hiding-place is?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, no; not that particularly; but I may take any if I want it. So help
      yourself.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will, to oblige you, since you have a right to it,' murmured the
      minister; and though he was not quite satisfied with his part in the
      performance, he rolled one of the 'tubs' out from the corner into the
      middle of the tower floor. 'How do you wish me to get it out-with a
      gimlet, I suppose?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, I'll show you,' said his interesting companion; and she held up with
      her other hand a shoemaker's awl and a hammer. 'You must never do these
      things with a gimlet, because the wood-dust gets in; and when the buyers
      pour out the brandy that would tell them that the tub had been broached.
      An awl makes no dust, and the hole nearly closes up again. Now tap one of
      the hoops forward.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Stockdale took the hammer and did so.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now make the hole in the part that was covered by the hoop.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He made the hole as directed. 'It won't run out,' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O yes it will,' said she. 'Take the tub between your knees, and squeeze
      the heads; and I'll hold the cup.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Stockdale obeyed; and the pressure taking effect upon the tub, which
      seemed, to be thin, the spirit spirted out in a stream. When the cup was
      full he ceased pressing, and the flow immediately stopped. 'Now we must
      fill up the keg with water,' said Lizzy, 'or it will cluck like forty hens
      when it is handled, and show that 'tis not full.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But they tell you you may take it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, the smugglers: but the buyers must not know that the smugglers have
      been kind to me at their expense.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I see,' said Stockdale doubtfully. 'I much question the honesty of this
      proceeding.'
    </p>
    <p>
      By her direction he held the tub with the hole upwards, and while he went
      through the process of alternately pressing and ceasing to press, she
      produced a bottle of water, from which she took mouthfuls, conveying each
      to the keg by putting her pretty lips to the hole, where it was sucked in
      at each recovery of the cask from pressure. When it was again full he
      plugged the hole, knocked the hoop down to its place, and buried the tub
      in the lumber as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Aren't the smugglers afraid that you will tell?' he asked, as they
      recrossed the churchyard.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no; they are not afraid of that. I couldn't do such a thing.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'They have put you into a very awkward corner,' said Stockdale
      emphatically. 'You must, of course, as an honest person, sometimes feel
      that it is your duty to inform-really you must.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I have never particularly felt it as a duty; and, besides, my first
      husband-' She stopped, and there was some confusion in her voice.
      Stockdale was so honest and unsophisticated that he did not at once
      discern why she paused: but at last he did perceive that the words were a
      slip, and that no woman would have uttered 'first husband' by accident
      unless she had thought pretty frequently of a second. He felt for her
      confusion, and allowed her time to recover and proceed. 'My husband,' she
      said, in a self-corrected tone, 'used to know of their doings, and so did
      my father, and kept the secret. I cannot inform, in fact, against
      anybody.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I see the hardness of it,' he continued, like a man who looked far into
      the moral of things. 'And it is very cruel that you should be tossed and
      tantalized between your memories and your conscience. I do hope, Mrs.
      Newberry, that you will soon see your way out of this unpleasant
      position.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I don't just now,' she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time they had passed over the wall and entered the house, where
      she brought him a glass and hot water, and left him to his own
      reflections. He looked after her vanishing form, asking himself whether
      he, as a respectable man, and a minister, and a shining light, even though
      as yet only of the halfpenny-candle sort, were quite justified in doing
      this thing. A sneeze settled the question; and he found that when the
      fiery liquor was lowered by the addition of twice or thrice the quantity
      of water, it was one of the prettiest cures for a cold in the head that he
      had ever known, particularly at this chilly time of the year.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stockdale sat in the deep chair about twenty minutes sipping and
      meditating, till he at length took warmer views of things, and longed for
      the morrow, when he would see Mrs. Newberry again. He then felt that,
      though chronologically at a short distance, it would in an emotional sense
      be very long before to-morrow came, and walked restlessly round the room.
      His eye was attracted by a framed and glazed sampler in which a running
      ornament of fir-trees and peacocks surrounded the following pretty bit of
      sentiment:-
    </p>
    <p>
      'Rose-leaves smell when roses thrive, Here's my work while I'm alive;
      Rose-leaves smell when shrunk and shed, Here's my work when I am dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lizzy Simpkins. Fear God. Honour the King.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Aged 11 years.
    </p>
    <p>
      ''Tis hers,' he said to himself. 'Heavens, how I like that name!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he had done thinking that no other name from Abigail to Zenobia
      would have suited his young landlady so well, tap-tap came again upon the
      door; and the minister started as her face appeared yet another time,
      looking so disinterested that the most ingenious would have refrained from
      asserting that she had come to affect his feelings by her seductive eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Would you like a fire in your room, Mr. Stockdale, on account of your
      cold?'
    </p>
    <p>
      The minister, being still a little pricked in the conscience for
      countenancing her in watering the spirits, saw here a way to self-
      chastisement. 'No, I thank you,' he said firmly; 'it is not necessary. I
      have never been used to one in my life, and it would be giving way to
      luxury too far.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then I won't insist,' she said, and disconcerted him by vanishing
      instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wondering if she was vexed by his refusal, he wished that he had chosen to
      have a fire, even though it should have scorched him out of bed and
      endangered his self-discipline for a dozen days. However, he consoled
      himself with what was in truth a rare consolation for a budding lover,
      that he was under the same roof with Lizzy; her guest, in fact, to take a
      poetical view of the term lodger; and that he would certainly see her on
      the morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morrow came, and Stockdale rose early, his cold quite gone. He had
      never in his life so longed for the breakfast hour as he did that day, and
      punctually at eight o'clock, after a short walk, to reconnoitre the
      premises, he re-entered the door of his dwelling. Breakfast passed, and
      Martha Sarah attended, but nobody came voluntarily as on the night before
      to inquire if there were other wants which he had not mentioned, and which
      she would attempt to gratify. He was disappointed, and went out, hoping to
      see her at dinner. Dinner time came; he sat down to the meal, finished it,
      lingered on for a whole hour, although two new teachers were at that
      moment waiting at the chapel-door to speak to him by appointment. It was
      useless to wait longer, and he slowly went his way down the lane, cheered
      by the thought that, after all, he would see her in the evening, and
      perhaps engage again in the delightful tub- broaching in the neighbouring
      church tower, which proceeding he resolved to render more moral by
      steadfastly insisting that no water should be introduced to fill up,
      though the tub should cluck like all the hens in Christendom. But nothing
      could disguise the fact that it was a queer business; and his countenance
      fell when he thought how much more his mind was interested in that matter
      than in his serious duties.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, compunction vanished with the decline of day. Night came, and his
      tea and supper; but no Lizzy Newberry, and no sweet temptations. At last
      the minister could bear it no longer, and said to his quaint little
      attendant, 'Where is Mrs. Newberry to-day?' judiciously handing a penny as
      he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      'She's busy,' said Martha.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Anything serious happened?' he asked, handing another penny, and
      revealing yet additional pennies in the background.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no-nothing at all!' said she, with breathless confidence. 'Nothing ever
      happens to her. She's only biding upstairs in bed because 'tis her way
      sometimes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Being a young man of some honour, he would not question further, and
      assuming that Lizzy must have a bad headache, or other slight ailment, in
      spite of what the girl had said, he went to bed dissatisfied, not even
      setting eyes on old Mrs. Simpkins. 'I said last night that I should see
      her to-morrow,' he reflected; 'but that was not to be!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day he had better fortune, or worse, meeting her at the foot of the
      stairs in the morning, and being favoured by a visit or two from her
      during the day-once for the purpose of making kindly inquiries about his
      comfort, as on the first evening, and at another time to place a bunch of
      winter-violets on his table, with a promise to renew them when they
      drooped. On these occasions there was something in her smile which showed
      how conscious she was of the effect she produced, though it must be said
      that it was rather a humorous than a designing consciousness, and savoured
      more of pride than of vanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Stockdale, he clearly perceived that he possessed unlimited
      capacity for backsliding, and wished that tutelary saints were not denied
      to Dissenters. He set a watch upon his tongue and eyes for the space of
      one hour and a half, after which he found it was useless to struggle
      further, and gave himself up to the situation. 'The other minister will be
      here in a month,' he said to himself when sitting over the fire. 'Then I
      shall be off, and she will distract my mind no more! . . . And then, shall
      I go on living by myself for ever? No; when my two years of probation are
      finished, I shall have a furnished house to live in, with a varnished door
      and a brass knocker; and I'll march straight back to her, and ask her
      flat, as soon as the last plate is on the dresser!
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus a titillating fortnight was passed by young Stockdale, during which
      time things proceeded much as such matters have done ever since the
      beginning of history. He saw the object of attachment several times one
      day, did not see her at all the next, met her when he least expected to do
      so, missed her when hints and signs as to where she should be at a given
      hour almost amounted to an appointment. This mild coquetry was perhaps
      fair enough under the circumstances of their being so closely lodged, and
      Stockdale put up with it as philosophically as he was able. Being in her
      own house, she could, after vexing him or disappointing him of her
      presence, easily win him back by suddenly surrounding him with those
      little attentions which her position as his landlady put it in her power
      to bestow. When he had waited indoors half the day to see her, and on
      finding that she would not be seen, had gone off in a huff to the
      dreariest and dampest walk he could discover, she would restore
      equilibrium in the evening with 'Mr. Stockdale, I have fancied you must
      feel draught o' nights from your bedroom window, and so I have been
      putting up thicker curtains this afternoon while you were out;' or, 'I
      noticed that you sneezed twice again this morning, Mr. Stockdale. Depend
      upon it that cold is hanging about you yet; I am sure it is-I have thought
      of it continually; and you must let me make a posset for you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes in coming home he found his sitting-room rearranged, chairs
      placed where the table had stood, and the table ornamented with the few
      fresh flowers and leaves that could be obtained at this season, so as to
      add a novelty to the room. At times she would be standing on a chair
      outside the house, trying to nail up a branch of the monthly rose which
      the winter wind had blown down; and of course he stepped forward to assist
      her, when their hands got mixed in passing the shreds and nails. Thus they
      became friends again after a disagreement. She would utter on these
      occasions some pretty and deprecatory remark on the necessity of her
      troubling him anew; and he would straightway say that he would do a
      hundred times as much for her if she should so require.

    <h2>
      II-HOW HE SAW TWO OTHER MEN
    </h2>
    <p>
      Matters being in this advancing state, Stockdale was rather surprised one
      cloudy evening, while sitting in his room, at hearing her speak in low
      tones of expostulation to some one at the door. It was nearly dark, but
      the shutters were not yet closed, nor the candles lighted; and Stockdale
      was tempted to stretch his head towards the window. He saw outside the
      door a young man in clothes of a whitish colour, and upon reflection
      judged their wearer to be the well-built and rather handsome miller who
      lived below. The miller's voice was alternately low and firm, and
      sometimes it reached the level of positive entreaty; but what the words
      were Stockdale could in no way hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the colloquy had ended, the minister's attention was attracted by a
      second incident. Opposite Lizzy's home grew a clump of laurels, forming a
      thick and permanent shade. One of the laurel boughs now quivered against
      the light background of sky, and in a moment the head of a man peered out,
      and remained still. He seemed to be also much interested in the
      conversation at the door, and was plainly lingering there to watch and
      listen. Had Stockdale stood in any other relation to Lizzy than that of a
      lover, he might have gone out and investigated the meaning of this: but
      being as yet but an unprivileged ally, he did nothing more than stand up
      and show himself against the firelight, whereupon the listener
      disappeared, and Lizzy and the miller spoke in lower tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stockdale was made so uneasy by the circumstance, that as soon as the
      miller was gone, he said, 'Mrs. Newberry, are you aware that you were
      watched just now, and your conversation heard?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'When?' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'When you were talking to that miller. A man was looking from the
      laurel-tree as jealously as if he could have eaten you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She showed more concern than the trifling event seemed to demand, and he
      added, 'Perhaps you were talking of things you did not wish to be
      overheard?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I was talking only on business,' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lizzy, be frank!' said the young man. 'If it was only on business, why
      should anybody wish to listen to you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked curiously at him. 'What else do you think it could be, then?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well-the only talk between a young woman and man that is likely to amuse
      an eavesdropper.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah yes,' she said, smiling in spite of her preoccupation. 'Well, my
      cousin Owlett has spoken to me about matrimony, every now and then, that's
      true; but he was not speaking of it then. I wish he had been speaking of
      it, with all my heart. It would have been much less serious for me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O Mrs. Newberry!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It would. Not that I should ha' chimed in with him, of course. I wish it
      for other reasons. I am glad, Mr. Stockdale, that you have told me of that
      listener. It is a timely warning, and I must see my cousin again.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But don't go away till I have spoken,' said the minister. 'I'll out with
      it at once, and make no more ado. Let it be Yes or No between us, Lizzy;
      please do!' And he held out his hand, in which she freely allowed her own
      to rest, but without speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You mean Yes by that?' he asked, after waiting a while.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You may be my sweetheart, if you will.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why not say at once you will wait for me until I have a house and can
      come back to marry you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Because I am thinking-thinking of something else,' she said with
      embarrassment. 'It all comes upon me at once, and I must settle one thing
      at a time.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'At any rate, dear Lizzy, you can assure me that the miller shall not be
      allowed to speak to you except on business? You have never directly
      encouraged him?'
    </p>
    <p>
      She parried the question by saying, 'You see, he and his party have been
      in the habit of leaving things on my premises sometimes, and as I have not
      denied him, it makes him rather forward.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Things-what things?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Tubs-they are called Things here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But why don't you deny him, my dear Lizzy?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I cannot well.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are too timid. It is unfair of him to impose so upon you, and get
      your good name into danger by his smuggling tricks. Promise me that the
      next time he wants to leave his tubs here you will let me roll them into
      the street?'
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head. 'I would not venture to offend the neighbours so much
      as that,' said she, 'or do anything that would be so likely to put poor
      Owlett into the hands of the excisemen.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Stockdale sighed, and said that he thought hers a mistaken generosity when
      it extended to assisting those who cheated the king of his dues. 'At any
      rate, you will let me make him keep his distance as your lover, and tell
      him flatly that you are not for him?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Please not, at present,' she said. 'I don't wish to offend my old
      neighbours. It is not only Owlett who is concerned.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'This is too bad,' said Stockdale impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      'On my honour, I won't encourage him as my lover,' Lizzy answered
      earnestly. 'A reasonable man will be satisfied with that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, so I am,' said Stockdale, his countenance clearing.

    <h2>
      III-THE MYSTERIOUS GREATCOAT
    </h2>
    <p>
      Stockdale now began to notice more particularly a feature in the life of
      his fair landlady, which he had casually observed but scarcely ever
      thought of before. It was that she was markedly irregular in her hours of
      rising. For a week or two she would be tolerably punctual, reaching the
      ground-floor within a few minutes of half-past seven. Then suddenly she
      would not be visible till twelve at noon, perhaps for three or four days
      in succession; and twice he had certain proof that she did not leave her
      room till half-past three in the afternoon. The second time that this
      extreme lateness came under his notice was on a day when he had
      particularly wished to consult with her about his future movements; and he
      concluded, as he always had done, that she had a cold, headache, or other
      ailment, unless she had kept herself invisible to avoid meeting and
      talking to him, which he could hardly believe. The former supposition was
      disproved, however, by her innocently saying, some days later, when they
      were speaking on a question of health, that she had never had a moment's
      heaviness, headache, or illness of any kind since the previous January
      twelvemonth.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am glad to hear it,' said he. 'I thought quite otherwise.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What, do I look sickly?' she asked, turning up her face to show the
      impossibility of his gazing on it and holding such a belief for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not at all; I merely thought so from your being sometimes obliged to keep
      your room through the best part of the day.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, as for that-it means nothing,' she murmured, with a look which some
      might have called cold, and which was the worst look that he liked to see
      upon her. 'It is pure sleepiness, Mr. Stockdale.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is, I tell you. When I stay in my room till half-past three in the
      afternoon, you may always be sure that I slept soundly till three, or I
      shouldn't have stayed there.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is dreadful,' said Stockdale, thinking of the disastrous effects of
      such indulgence upon the household of a minister, should it become a habit
      of everyday occurrence.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But then,' she said, divining his good and prescient thoughts, 'it only
      happens when I stay awake all night. I don't go to sleep till five or six
      in the morning sometimes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, that's another matter,' said Stockdale. 'Sleeplessness to such an
      alarming extent is real illness. Have you spoken to a doctor?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no-there is no need for doing that-it is all natural to me.' And she
      went away without further remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stockdale might have waited a long time to know the real cause of her
      sleeplessness, had it not happened that one dark night he was sitting in
      his bedroom jotting down notes for a sermon, which occupied him
      perfunctorily for a considerable time after the other members of the
      household had retired. He did not get to bed till one o'clock. Before he
      had fallen asleep he heard a knocking at the front door, first rather
      timidly performed, and then louder. Nobody answered it, and the person
      knocked again. As the house still remained undisturbed, Stockdale got out
      of bed, went to his window, which overlooked the door, and opening it,
      asked who was there.
    </p>
    <p>
      A young woman's voice replied that Susan Wallis was there, and that she
      had come to ask if Mrs. Newberry could give her some mustard to make a
      plaster with, as her father was taken very ill on the chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The minister, having neither bell nor servant, was compelled to act in
      person. 'I will call Mrs. Newberry,' he said. Partly dressing himself; he
      went along the passage and tapped at Lizzy's door. She did not answer,
      and, thinking of her erratic habits in the matter of sleep, he thumped the
      door persistently, when he discovered, by its moving ajar under his
      knocking, that it had only been gently pushed to. As there was now a
      sufficient entry for the voice, he knocked no longer, but said in firm
      tones, 'Mrs. Newberry, you are wanted.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The room was quite silent; not a breathing, not a rustle, came from any
      part of it. Stockdale now sent a positive shout through the open space of
      the door: 'Mrs. Newberry!'-still no answer, or movement of any kind
      within. Then he heard sounds from the opposite room, that of Lizzy's
      mother, as if she had been aroused by his uproar though Lizzy had not, and
      was dressing herself hastily. Stockdale softly closed the younger woman's
      door and went on to the other, which was opened by Mrs. Simpkins before he
      could reach it. She was in her ordinary clothes, and had a light in her
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What's the person calling about?' she said in alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stockdale told the girl's errand, adding seriously, 'I cannot wake Mrs.
      Newberry.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is no matter,' said her mother. 'I can let the girl have what she
      wants as well as my daughter.' And she came out of the room and went
      downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stockdale retired towards his own apartment, saying, however, to Mrs.
      Simpkins from the landing, as if on second thoughts, 'I suppose there is
      nothing the matter with Mrs. Newberry, that I could not wake her?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no,' said the old lady hastily. 'Nothing at all.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Still the minister was not satisfied. 'Will you go in and see?' he said.
      'I should be much more at ease.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Simpkins returned up the staircase, went to her daughter's room, and
      came out again almost instantly. 'There is nothing at all the matter with
      Lizzy,' she said; and descended again to attend to the applicant, who,
      having seen the light, had remained quiet during this interval.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stockdale went into his room and lay down as before. He heard Lizzy's
      mother open the front door, admit the girl, and then the murmured
      discourse of both as they went to the store-cupboard for the medicament
      required. The girl departed, the door was fastened, Mrs. Simpkins came
      upstairs, and the house was again in silence. Still the minister did not
      fall asleep. He could not get rid of a singular suspicion, which was all
      the more harassing in being, if true, the most unaccountable thing within
      his experience. That Lizzy Newberry was in her bedroom when he made such a
      clamour at the door he could not possibly convince himself;
      notwithstanding that he had heard her come upstairs at the usual time, go
      into her chamber, and shut herself up in the usual way. Yet all reason was
      so much against her being elsewhere, that he was constrained to go back
      again to the unlikely theory of a heavy sleep, though he had heard neither
      breath nor movement during a shouting and knocking loud enough to rouse
      the Seven Sleepers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before coming to any positive conclusion he fell asleep himself, and did
      not awake till day. He saw nothing of Mrs. Newberry in the morning, before
      he went out to meet the rising sun, as he liked to do when the weather was
      fine; but as this was by no means unusual, he took no notice of it. At
      breakfast-time he knew that she was not far off by hearing her in the
      kitchen, and though he saw nothing of her person, that back apartment
      being rigorously closed against his eyes, she seemed to be talking,
      ordering, and bustling about among the pots and skimmers in so ordinary a
      manner, that there was no reason for his wasting more time in fruitless
      surmise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The minister suffered from these distractions, and his extemporized
      sermons were not improved thereby. Already he often said Romans for
      Corinthians in the pulpit, and gave out hymns in strange cramped metres,
      that hitherto had always been skipped, because the congregation could not
      raise a tune to fit them. He fully resolved that as soon as his few weeks
      of stay approached their end he would cut the matter short, and commit
      himself by proposing a definite engagement, repenting at leisure if
      necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this end in view, he suggested to her on the evening after her
      mysterious sleep that they should take a walk together just before dark,
      the latter part of the proposition being introduced that they might return
      home unseen. She consented to go; and away they went over a stile, to a
      shrouded footpath suited for the occasion. But, in spite of attempts on
      both sides, they were unable to infuse much spirit into the ramble. She
      looked rather paler than usual, and sometimes turned her head away.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lizzy,' said Stockdale reproachfully, when they had walked in silence a
      long distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You yawned-much my company is to you!' He put it in that way, but he was
      really wondering whether her yawn could possibly have more to do with
      physical weariness from the night before than mental weariness of that
      present moment. Lizzy apologized, and owned that she was rather tired,
      which gave him an opening for a direct question on the point; but his
      modesty would not allow him to put it to her; and he uncomfortably
      resolved to wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      The month of February passed with alternations of mud and frost, rain and
      sleet, east winds and north-westerly gales. The hollow places in the
      ploughed fields showed themselves as pools of water, which had settled
      there from the higher levels, and had not yet found time to soak away. The
      birds began to get lively, and a single thrush came just before sunset
      each evening, and sang hopefully on the large elm-tree which stood nearest
      to Mrs. Newberry's house. Cold blasts and brittle earth had given place to
      an oozing dampness more unpleasant in itself than frost; but it suggested
      coming spring, and its unpleasantness was of a bearable kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stockdale had been going to bring about a practical understanding with
      Lizzy at least half-a-dozen times; but, what with the mystery of her
      apparent absence on the night of the neighbour's call, and her curious way
      of lying in bed at unaccountable times, he felt a check within him
      whenever he wanted to speak out. Thus they still lived on as indefinitely
      affianced lovers, each of whom hardly acknowledged the other's claim to
      the name of chosen one. Stockdale persuaded himself that his hesitation
      was owing to the postponement of the ordained minister's arrival, and the
      consequent delay in his own departure, which did away with all necessity
      for haste in his courtship; but perhaps it was only that his discretion
      was reasserting itself, and telling him that he had better get clearer
      ideas of Lizzy before arranging for the grand contract of his life with
      her. She, on her part, always seemed ready to be urged further on that
      question than he had hitherto attempted to go; but she was none the less
      independent, and to a degree which would have kept from flagging the
      passion of a far more mutable man.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the evening of the first of March he went casually into his bedroom
      about dusk, and noticed lying on a chair a greatcoat, hat, and breeches.
      Having no recollection of leaving any clothes of his own in that spot, he
      went and examined them as well as he could in the twilight, and found that
      they did not belong to him. He paused for a moment to consider how they
      might have got there. He was the only man living in the house; and yet
      these were not his garments, unless he had made a mistake. No, they were
      not his. He called up Martha Sarah.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How did these things come in my room?' he said, flinging the
      objectionable articles to the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Martha said that Mrs. Newberry had given them to her to brush, and that
      she had brought them up there thinking they must be Mr. Stockdale's, as
      there was no other gentleman a-lodging there.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of course you did,' said Stockdale. 'Now take them down to your mis'ess,
      and say they are some clothes I have found here and know nothing about.'
    </p>
    <p>
      As the door was left open he heard the conversation downstairs. 'How
      stupid!' said Mrs. Newberry, in a tone of confusion. 'Why, Marther Sarer,
      I did not tell you to take 'em to Mr. Stockdale's room?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I thought they must be his as they was so muddy,' said Martha humbly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You should have left 'em on the clothes-horse,' said the young mistress
      severely; and she came upstairs with the garments on her arm, quickly
      passed Stockdale's room, and threw them forcibly into a closet at the end
      of a passage. With this the incident ended, and the house was silent
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      There would have been nothing remarkable in finding such clothes in a
      widow's house had they been clean; or moth-eaten, or creased, or mouldy
      from long lying by; but that they should be splashed with recent mud
      bothered Stockdale a good deal. When a young pastor is in the aspen stage
      of attachment, and open to agitation at the merest trifles, a really
      substantial incongruity of this complexion is a disturbing thing. However,
      nothing further occurred at that time; but he became watchful, and given
      to conjecture, and was unable to forget the circumstance.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning, on looking from his window, he saw Mrs. Newberry herself
      brushing the tails of a long drab greatcoat, which, if he mistook not, was
      the very same garment as the one that had adorned the chair of his room.
      It was densely splashed up to the hollow of the back with neighbouring
      Nether-Moynton mud, to judge by its colour, the spots being distinctly
      visible to him in the sunlight. The previous day or two having been wet,
      the inference was irresistible that the wearer had quite recently been
      walking some considerable distance about the lanes and fields. Stockdale
      opened the window and looked out, and Mrs. Newberry turned her head. Her
      face became slowly red; she never had looked prettier, or more
      incomprehensible, he waved his hand affectionately, and said good-morning;
      she answered with embarrassment, having ceased her occupation on the
      instant that she saw him, and rolled up the coat half-cleaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stockdale shut the window. Some simple explanation of her proceeding was
      doubtless within the bounds of possibility; but he himself could not think
      of one; and he wished that she had placed the matter beyond conjecture by
      voluntarily saying something about it there and then.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, though Lizzy had not offered an explanation at the moment, the
      subject was brought forward by her at the next time of their meeting. She
      was chatting to him concerning some other event, and remarked that it
      happened about the time when she was dusting some old clothes that had
      belonged to her poor husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You keep them clean out of respect to his memory?' said Stockdale
      tentatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I air and dust them sometimes,' she said, with the most charming
      innocence in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do dead men come out of their graves and walk in mud?' murmured the
      minister, in a cold sweat at the deception that she was practising.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What did you say?' asked Lizzy.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nothing, nothing,' said he mournfully. 'Mere words-a phrase that will do
      for my sermon next Sunday.' It was too plain that Lizzy was unaware that
      he had seen actual pedestrian splashes upon the skirts of the tell- tale
      overcoat, and that she imagined him to believe it had come direct from
      some chest or drawer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The aspect of the case was now considerably darker. Stockdale was so much
      depressed by it that he did not challenge her explanation, or threaten to
      go off as a missionary to benighted islanders, or reproach her in any way
      whatever. He simply parted from her when she had done talking, and lived
      on in perplexity, till by degrees his natural manner became sad and
      constrained.

    <h2>
      IV-AT THE TIME OF THE NEW MOON
    </h2>
    <p>
      The following Thursday was changeable, damp, and gloomy; and the night
      threatened to be windy and unpleasant. Stockdale had gone away to Knollsea
      in the morning, to be present at some commemoration service there, and on
      his return he was met by the attractive Lizzy in the passage. Whether
      influenced by the tide of cheerfulness which had attended him that day, or
      by the drive through the open air, or whether from a natural disposition
      to let bygones alone, he allowed himself to be fascinated into
      forgetfulness of the greatcoat incident, and upon the whole passed a
      pleasant evening; not so much in her society as within sound of her voice,
      as she sat talking in the back parlour to her mother, till the latter went
      to bed. Shortly after this Mrs. Newberry retired, and then Stockdale
      prepared to go upstairs himself. But before he left the room he remained
      standing by the dying embers awhile, thinking long of one thing and
      another; and was only aroused by the flickering of his candle in the
      socket as it suddenly declined and went out. Knowing that there were a
      tinder-box, matches, and another candle in his bedroom, he felt his way
      upstairs without a light. On reaching his chamber he laid his hand on
      every possible ledge and corner for the tinderbox, but for a long time in
      vain. Discovering it at length, Stockdale produced a spark, and was
      kindling the brimstone, when he fancied that he heard a movement in the
      passage. He blew harder at the lint, the match flared up, and looking by
      aid of the blue light through the door, which had been standing open all
      this time, he was surprised to see a male figure vanishing round the top
      of the staircase with the evident intention of escaping unobserved. The
      personage wore the clothes which Lizzy had been brushing, and something in
      the outline and gait suggested to the minister that the wearer was Lizzy
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he was not sure of this; and, greatly excited, Stockdale determined to
      investigate the mystery, and to adopt his own way for doing it. He blew
      out the match without lighting the candle, went into the passage, and
      proceeded on tiptoe towards Lizzy's room. A faint grey square of light in
      the direction of the chamber-window as he approached told him that the
      door was open, and at once suggested that the occupant was gone. He turned
      and brought down his fist upon the handrail of the staircase: 'It was she;
      in her late husband's coat and hat!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Somewhat relieved to find that there was no intruder in the case, yet none
      the less surprised, the minister crept down the stairs, softly put on his
      boots, overcoat, and hat, and tried the front door. It was fastened as
      usual: he went to the back door, found this unlocked, and emerged into the
      garden. The night was mild and moonless, and rain had lately been falling,
      though for the present it had ceased. There was a sudden dropping from the
      trees and bushes every now and then, as each passing wind shook their
      boughs. Among these sounds Stockdale heard the faint fall of feet upon the
      road outside, and he guessed from the step that it was Lizzy's. He
      followed the sound, and, helped by the circumstance of the wind blowing
      from the direction in which the pedestrian moved, he got nearly close to
      her, and kept there, without risk of being overheard. While he thus
      followed her up the street or lane, as it might indifferently be called,
      there being more hedge than houses on either side, a figure came forward
      to her from one of the cottage doors. Lizzy stopped; the minister stepped
      upon the grass and stopped also.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is that Mrs. Newberry?' said the man who had come out, whose voice
      Stockdale recognized as that of one of the most devout members of his
      congregation.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is,' said Lizzy.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I be quite ready-I've been here this quarter-hour.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, John,' said she, 'I have bad news; there is danger to-night for our
      venture.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And d'ye tell o't! I dreamed there might be.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' she said hurriedly; 'and you must go at once round to where the
      chaps are waiting, and tell them they will not be wanted till to-morrow
      night at the same time. I go to burn the lugger off.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will,' he said; and instantly went off through a gate, Lizzy continuing
      her way.
    </p>
    <p>
      On she tripped at a quickening pace till the lane turned into the
      turnpike-road, which she crossed, and got into the track for Ringsworth.
      Here she ascended the hill without the least hesitation, passed the lonely
      hamlet of Holworth, and went down the vale on the other side. Stockdale
      had never taken any extensive walks in this direction, but he was aware
      that if she persisted in her course much longer she would draw near to the
      coast, which was here between two and three miles distant from
      Nether-Moynton; and as it had been about a quarter-past eleven o'clock
      when they set out, her intention seemed to be to reach the shore about
      midnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lizzy soon ascended a small mound, which Stockdale at the same time
      adroitly skirted on the left; and a dull monotonous roar burst upon his
      ear. The hillock was about fifty yards from the top of the cliffs, and by
      day it apparently commanded a full view of the bay. There was light enough
      in the sky to show her disguised figure against it when she reached the
      top, where she paused, and afterwards sat down. Stockdale, not wishing on
      any account to alarm her at this moment, yet desirous of being near her,
      sank upon his hands and knees, crept a little higher up, and there stayed
      still.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wind was chilly, the ground damp, and his position one in which he did
      not care to remain long. However, before he had decided to leave it, the
      young man heard voices behind him. What they signified he did not know;
      but, fearing that Lizzy was in danger, he was about to run forward and
      warn her that she might be seen, when she crept to the shelter of a little
      bush which maintained a precarious existence in that exposed spot; and her
      form was absorbed in its dark and stunted outline as if she had become
      part of it. She had evidently heard the men as well as he. They passed
      near him, talking in loud and careless tones, which could be heard above
      the uninterrupted washings of the sea, and which suggested that they were
      not engaged in any business at their own risk. This proved to be the fact:
      some of their words floated across to him, and caused him to forget at
      once the coldness of his situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What's the vessel?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A lugger, about fifty tons.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'From Cherbourg, I suppose?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, 'a b'lieve.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But it don't all belong to Owlett?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no. He's only got a share. There's another or two in it-a farmer and
      such like, but the names I don't know.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The voices died away, and the heads and shoulders of the men diminished
      towards the cliff, and dropped out of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My darling has been tempted to buy a share by that unbeliever Owlett,'
      groaned the minister, his honest affection for Lizzy having quickened to
      its intensest point during these moments of risk to her person and name.
      'That's why she's here,' he said to himself. 'O, it will be the ruin of
      her!'
    </p>
    <p>
      His perturbation was interrupted by the sudden bursting out of a bright
      and increasing light from the spot where Lizzy was in hiding. A few
      seconds later, and before it had reached the height of a blaze, he heard
      her rush past him down the hollow like a stone from a sling, in the
      direction of home. The light now flared high and wide, and showed its
      position clearly. She had kindled a bough of furze and stuck it into the
      bush under which she had been crouching; the wind fanned the flame, which
      crackled fiercely, and threatened to consume the bush as well as the
      bough. Stockdale paused just long enough to notice thus much, and then
      followed rapidly the route taken by the young woman. His intention was to
      overtake her, and reveal himself as a friend; but run as he would he could
      see nothing of her. Thus he flew across the open country about Holworth,
      twisting his legs and ankles in unexpected fissures and descents, till, on
      coming to the gate between the downs and the road, he was forced to pause
      to get breath. There was no audible movement either in front or behind
      him, and he now concluded that she had not outrun him, but that, hearing
      him at her heels, and believing him one of the excise party, she had
      hidden herself somewhere on the way, and let him pass by.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went on at a more leisurely pace towards the village. On reaching the
      house he found his surmise to be correct, for the gate was on the latch,
      and the door unfastened, just as he had left them. Stockdale closed the
      door behind him, and waited silently in the passage. In about ten minutes
      he heard the same light footstep that he had heard in going out; it paused
      at the gate, which opened and shut softly, and then the door-latch was
      lifted, and Lizzy came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stockdale went forward and said at once, 'Lizzy, don't be frightened. I
      have been waiting up for you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She started, though she had recognized the voice. 'It is Mr. Stockdale,
      isn't it?' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' he answered, becoming angry now that she was safe indoors, and not
      alarmed. 'And a nice game I've found you out in to-night. You are in man's
      clothes, and I am ashamed of you!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lizzy could hardly find a voice to answer this unexpected reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am only partly in man's clothes,' she faltered, shrinking back to the
      wall. 'It is only his greatcoat and hat and breeches that I've got on,
      which is no harm, as he was my own husband; and I do it only because a
      cloak blows about so, and you can't use your arms. I have got my own dress
      under just the same-it is only tucked in! Will you go away upstairs and
      let me pass? I didn't want you to see me at such a time as this!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But I have a right to see you! How do you think there can be anything
      between us now?' Lizzy was silent. 'You are a smuggler,' he continued
      sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have only a share in the run,' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'That makes no difference. Whatever did you engage in such a trade as that
      for, and keep it such a secret from me all this time?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't do it always. I only do it in winter-time when 'tis new moon.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I suppose that's because it can't be done anywhen else . . . You
      have regularly upset me, Lizzy.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am sorry for that,' Lizzy meekly replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well now,' said he more tenderly, 'no harm is done as yet. Won't you for
      the sake of me give up this blamable and dangerous practice altogether?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I must do my best to save this run,' said she, getting rather husky in
      the throat. 'I don't want to give you up-you know that; but I don't want
      to lose my venture. I don't know what to do now! Why I have kept it so
      secret from you is that I was afraid you would be angry if you knew.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I should think so! I suppose if I had married you without finding this
      out you'd have gone on with it just the same?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't know. I did not think so far ahead. I only went to-night to burn
      the folks off, because we found that the excisemen knew where the tubs
      were to be landed.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is a pretty mess to be in altogether, is this,' said the distracted
      young minister. 'Well, what will you do now?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lizzy slowly murmured the particulars of their plan, the chief of which
      were that they meant to try their luck at some other point of the shore
      the next night; that three landing-places were always agreed upon before
      the run was attempted, with the understanding that, if the vessel was
      'burnt off' from the first point, which was Ringsworth, as it had been by
      her to-night, the crew should attempt to make the second, which was
      Lulstead Cove, on the second night; and if there, too, danger threatened,
      they should on the third night try the third place, which was behind a
      headland further west.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Suppose the officers hinder them landing there too?' he said, his
      attention to this interesting programme displacing for a moment his
      concern at her share in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then we shan't try anywhere else all this dark-that's what we call the
      time between moon and moon-and perhaps they'll string the tubs to a
      stray-line, and sink 'em a little-ways from shore, and take the bearings;
      and then when they have a chance they'll go to creep for 'em.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What's that?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, they'll go out in a boat and drag a creeper-that's a grapnel-along the
      bottom till it catch hold of the stray-line.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The minister stood thinking; and there was no sound within doors but the
      tick of the clock on the stairs, and the quick breathing of Lizzy, partly
      from her walk and partly from agitation, as she stood close to the wall,
      not in such complete darkness but that he could discern against its
      whitewashed surface the greatcoat and broad hat which covered her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lizzy, all this is very wrong,' he said. 'Don't you remember the lesson
      of the tribute-money? "Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's."
      Surely you have heard that read times enough in your growing up?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He's dead,' she pouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But the spirit of the text is in force just the same.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'My father did it, and so did my grandfather, and almost everybody in
      Nether-Moynton lives by it, and life would be so dull if it wasn't for
      that, that I should not care to live at all.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am nothing to live for, of course,' he replied bitterly. 'You would not
      think it worth while to give up this wild business and live for me alone?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have never looked at it like that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And you won't promise and wait till I am ready?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I cannot give you my word to-night.' And, looking thoughtfully down, she
      gradually moved and moved away, going into the adjoining room, and closing
      the door between them. She remained there in the dark till he was tired of
      waiting, and had gone up to his own chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Stockdale was dreadfully depressed all the next day by the
      discoveries of the night before. Lizzy was unmistakably a fascinating
      young woman, but as a minister's wife she was hardly to be contemplated.
      'If I had only stuck to father's little grocery business, instead of going
      in for the ministry, she would have suited me beautifully!' he said sadly,
      until he remembered that in that case he would never have come from his
      distant home to Nether-Moynton, and never have known her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The estrangement between them was not complete, but it was sufficient to
      keep them out of each other's company. Once during the day he met her in
      the garden-path, and said, turning a reproachful eye upon her, 'Do you
      promise, Lizzy?' But she did not reply. The evening drew on, and he knew
      well enough that Lizzy would repeat her excursion at night-her
      half-offended manner had shown that she had not the slightest intention of
      altering her plans at present. He did not wish to repeat his own share of
      the adventure; but, act as he would, his uneasiness on her account
      increased with the decline of day. Supposing that an accident should
      befall her, he would never forgive himself for not being there to help,
      much as he disliked the idea of seeming to countenance such unlawful
      escapades.

    <h2>
      V-HOW THEY WENT TO LULSTEAD COVE
    </h2>
    <p>
      As he had expected, she left the house at the same hour at night, this
      time passing his door without stealth, as if she knew very well that he
      would be watching, and were resolved to brave his displeasure. He was
      quite ready, opened the door quickly, and reached the back door almost as
      soon as she.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then you will go, Lizzy?' he said as he stood on the step beside her, who
      now again appeared as a little man with a face altogether unsuited to his
      clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I must,' she said, repressed by his stern manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then I shall go too,' said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And I am sure you will enjoy it!' she exclaimed in more buoyant tones.
      'Everybody does who tries it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'God forbid that I should!' he said. 'But I must look after you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      They opened the wicket and went up the road abreast of each other, but at
      some distance apart, scarcely a word passing between them. The evening was
      rather less favourable to smuggling enterprise than the last had been, the
      wind being lower, and the sky somewhat clear towards the north.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is rather lighter,' said Stockdale.
    </p>
    <p>
      ''Tis, unfortunately,' said she. 'But it is only from those few stars over
      there. The moon was new to-day at four o'clock, and I expected clouds. I
      hope we shall be able to do it this dark, for when we have to sink 'em for
      long it makes the stuff taste bleachy, and folks don't like it so well.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Her course was different from that of the preceding night, branching off
      to the left over Lord's Barrow as soon as they had got out of the lane and
      crossed the highway. By the time they reached Chaldon Down, Stockdale, who
      had been in perplexed thought as to what he should say to her, decided
      that he would not attempt expostulation now, while she was excited by the
      adventure, but wait till it was over, and endeavour to keep her from such
      practices in future. It occurred to him once or twice, as they rambled on,
      that should they be surprised by the excisemen, his situation would be
      more awkward than hers, for it would be difficult to prove his true motive
      in coming to the spot; but the risk was a slight consideration beside his
      wish to be with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      They now arrived at a ravine which lay on the outskirts of Chaldon, a
      village two miles on their way towards the point of the shore they sought.
      Lizzy broke the silence this time: 'I have to wait here to meet the
      carriers. I don't know if they have come yet. As I told you, we go to
      Lulstead Cove to-night, and it is two miles further than Ringsworth.'
    </p>
    <p>
      It turned out that the men had already come; for while she spoke two or
      three dozen heads broke the line of the slope, and a company of them at
      once descended from the bushes where they had been lying in wait. These
      carriers were men whom Lizzy and other proprietors regularly employed to
      bring the tubs from the boat to a hiding-place inland. They were all young
      fellows of Nether-Moynton, Chaldon, and the neighbourhood, quiet and
      inoffensive persons, who simply engaged to carry the cargo for Lizzy and
      her cousin Owlett, as they would have engaged in any other labour for
      which they were fairly well paid.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a word from her they closed in together. 'You had better take it now,'
      she said to them; and handed to each a packet. It contained six shillings,
      their remuneration for the night's undertaking, which was paid beforehand
      without reference to success or failure; but, besides this, they had the
      privilege of selling as agents when the run was successfully made. As soon
      as it was done, she said to them, 'The place is the old one near Lulstead
      Cove;' the men till that moment not having been told whither they were
      bound, for obvious reasons. 'Owlett will meet you there,' added Lizzy. 'I
      shall follow behind, to see that we are not watched.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The carriers went on, and Stockdale and Mrs. Newberry followed at a
      distance of a stone's throw. 'What do these men do by day?' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Twelve or fourteen of them are labouring men. Some are brickmakers, some
      carpenters, some shoe-makers, some thatchers. They are all known to me
      very well. Nine of 'em are of your own congregation.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I can't help that,' said Stockdale.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, I know you can't. I only told you. The others are more church-
      inclined, because they supply the pa'son with all the spirits he requires,
      and they don't wish to show unfriendliness to a customer.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How do you choose 'em?' said Stockdale.
    </p>
    <p>
      'We choose 'em for their closeness, and because they are strong and
      surefooted, and able to carry a heavy load a long way without being
      tired.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Stockdale sighed as she enumerated each particular, for it proved how far
      involved in the business a woman must be who was so well acquainted with
      its conditions and needs. And yet he felt more tenderly towards her at
      this moment than he had felt all the foregoing day. Perhaps it was that
      her experienced manner and hold indifference stirred his admiration in
      spite of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Take my arm, Lizzy,' he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't want it,' she said. 'Besides, we may never be to each other again
      what we once have been.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That depends upon you,' said he, and they went on again as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hired carriers paced along over Chaldon Down with as little hesitation
      as if it had been day, avoiding the cart-way, and leaving the village of
      East Chaldon on the left, so as to reach the crest of the hill at a lonely
      trackless place not far from the ancient earthwork called Round Pound. An
      hour's brisk walking brought them within sound of the sea, not many
      hundred yards from Lulstead Cove. Here they paused, and Lizzy and
      Stockdale came up with them, when they went on together to the verge of
      the cliff. One of the men now produced an iron bar, which he drove firmly
      into the soil a yard from the edge, and attached to it a rope that he had
      uncoiled from his body. They all began to descend, partly stepping, partly
      sliding down the incline, as the rope slipped through their hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You will not go to the bottom, Lizzy?' said Stockdale anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No. I stay here to watch,' she said. 'Owlett is down there.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The men remained quite silent when they reached the shore; and the next
      thing audible to the two at the top was the dip of heavy oars, and the
      dashing of waves against a boat's bow. In a moment the keel gently touched
      the shingle, and Stockdale heard the footsteps of the thirty-six carriers
      running forwards over the pebbles towards the point of landing.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a sousing in the water as of a brood of ducks plunging in,
      showing that the men had not been particular about keeping their legs, or
      even their waists, dry from the brine: but it was impossible to see what
      they were doing, and in a few minutes the shingle was trampled again. The
      iron bar sustaining the rope, on which Stockdale's hand rested, began to
      swerve a little, and the carriers one by one appeared climbing up the
      sloping cliff; dripping audibly as they came, and sustaining themselves by
      the guide-rope. Each man on reaching the top was seen to be carrying a
      pair of tubs, one on his back and one on his chest, the two being slung
      together by cords passing round the chine hoops, and resting on the
      carrier's shoulders. Some of the stronger men carried three by putting an
      extra one on the top behind, but the customary load was a pair, these
      being quite weighty enough to give their bearer the sensation of having
      chest and backbone in contact after a walk of four or five miles.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Where is Owlett?' said Lizzy to one of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He will not come up this way,' said the carrier. 'He's to bide on shore
      till we be safe off.' Then, without waiting for the rest, the foremost men
      plunged across the down; and, when the last had ascended, Lizzy pulled up
      the rope, wound it round her arm, wriggled the bar from the sod, and
      turned to follow the carriers.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are very anxious about Owlett's safety,' said the minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Was there ever such a man!' said Lizzy. 'Why, isn't he my cousin?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. Well, it is a bad night's work,' said Stockdale heavily. 'But I'll
      carry the bar and rope for you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Thank God, the tubs have got so far all right,' said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stockdale shook his head, and, taking the bar, walked by her side towards
      the downs; and the moan of the sea was heard no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is this what you meant the other day when you spoke of having business
      with Owlett?' the young man asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      'This is it,' she replied. 'I never see him on any other matter.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A partnership of that kind with a young man is very odd.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It was begun by my father and his, who were brother-laws.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Her companion could not blind himself to the fact that where tastes and
      pursuits were so akin as Lizzy's and Owlett's, and where risks were
      shared, as with them, in every undertaking, there would be a peculiar
      appropriateness in her answering Owlett's standing question on matrimony
      in the affirmative. This did not soothe Stockdale, its tendency being
      rather to stimulate in him an effort to make the pair as inappropriate as
      possible, and win her away from this nocturnal crew to correctness of
      conduct and a minister's parlour in some far-removed inland county.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had been walking near enough to the file of carriers for Stockdale to
      perceive that, when they got into the road to the village, they split up
      into two companies of unequal size, each of which made off in a direction
      of its own. One company, the smaller of the two, went towards the church,
      and by the time that Lizzy and Stockdale reached their own house these men
      had scaled the churchyard wall, and were proceeding noiselessly over the
      grass within.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I see that Owlett has arranged for one batch to be put in the church
      again,' observed Lizzy. 'Do you remember my taking you there the first
      night you came?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, of course,' said Stockdale. 'No wonder you had permission to broach
      the tubs-they were his, I suppose?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, they were not-they were mine; I had permission from myself. The day
      after that they went several miles inland in a waggon-load of manure, and
      sold very well.'
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the group of men who had made off to the left some time
      before began leaping one by one from the hedge opposite Lizzy's house, and
      the first man, who had no tubs upon his shoulders, came forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mrs. Newberry, isn't it?' he said hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, Jim,' said she. 'What's the matter?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I find that we can't put any in Badger's Clump to-night, Lizzy,' said
      Owlett. 'The place is watched. We must sling the apple-tree in the orchet
      if there's time. We can't put any more under the church lumber than I have
      sent on there, and my mixen hev already more in en than is safe.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very well,' she said. 'Be quick about it-that's all. What can I do?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nothing at all, please. Ah, it is the minister!-you two that can't do
      anything had better get indoors and not be zeed.'
    </p>
    <p>
      While Owlett thus conversed, in a tone so full of contraband anxiety and
      so free from lover's jealousy, the men who followed him had been
      descending one by one from the hedge; and it unfortunately happened that
      when the hindmost took his leap, the cord slipped which sustained his
      tubs: the result was that both the kegs fell into the road, one of them
      being stove in by the blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      ''Od drown it all!' said Owlett, rushing back.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is worth a good deal, I suppose?' said Stockdale.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no-about two guineas and half to us now,' said Lizzy excitedly. 'It
      isn't that-it is the smell! It is so blazing strong before it has been
      lowered by water, that it smells dreadfully when spilt in the road like
      that! I do hope Latimer won't pass by till it is gone off.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Owlett and one or two others picked up the burst tub and began to scrape
      and trample over the spot, to disperse the liquor as much as possible; and
      then they all entered the gate of Owlett's orchard, which adjoined Lizzy's
      garden on the right. Stockdale did not care to follow them, for several on
      recognizing him had looked wonderingly at his presence, though they said
      nothing. Lizzy left his side and went to the bottom of the garden, looking
      over the hedge into the orchard, where the men could be dimly seen
      bustling about, and apparently hiding the tubs. All was done noiselessly,
      and without a light; and when it was over they dispersed in different
      directions, those who had taken their cargoes to the church having already
      gone off to their homes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lizzy returned to the garden-gate, over which Stockdale was still
      abstractedly leaning. 'It is all finished: I am going indoors now,' she
      said gently. 'I will leave the door ajar for you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no-you needn't,' said Stockdale; 'I am coming too.'
    </p>
    <p>
      But before either of them had moved, the faint clatter of horses' hoofs
      broke upon the ear, and it seemed to come from the point where the track
      across the down joined the hard road.
    </p>
    <p>
      'They are just too late!' cried Lizzy exultingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who?' said Stockdale.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Latimer, the riding-officer, and some assistant of his. We had better go
      indoors.'
    </p>
    <p>
      They entered the house, and Lizzy bolted the door. 'Please don't get a
      light, Mr. Stockdale,' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of course I will not,' said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I thought you might be on the side of the king,' said Lizzy, with
      faintest sarcasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am,' said Stockdale. 'But, Lizzy Newberry, I love you, and you know it
      perfectly well; and you ought to know, if you do not, what I have suffered
      in my conscience on your account these last few days!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I guess very well,' she said hurriedly. 'Yet I don't see why. Ah, you are
      better than I!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The trotting of the horses seemed to have again died away, and the pair of
      listeners touched each other's fingers in the cold 'Good-night' of those
      whom something seriously divided. They were on the landing, but before
      they had taken three steps apart, the tramp of the horsemen suddenly
      revived, almost close to the house. Lizzy turned to the staircase window,
      opened the casement about an inch, and put her face close to the aperture.
      'Yes, one of 'em is Latimer,' she whispered. 'He always rides a white
      horse. One would think it was the last colour for a man in that line.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Stockdale looked, and saw the white shape of the animal as it passed by;
      but before the riders had gone another ten yards, Latimer reined in his
      horse, and said something to his companion which neither Stockdale nor
      Lizzy could hear. Its drift was, however, soon made evident, for the other
      man stopped also; and sharply turning the horses' heads they cautiously
      retraced their steps. When they were again opposite Mrs. Newberry's
      garden, Latimer dismounted, and the man on the dark horse did the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lizzy and Stockdale, intently listening and observing the proceedings,
      naturally put their heads as close as possible to the slit formed by the
      slightly opened casement; and thus it occurred that at last their cheeks
      came positively into contact. They went on listening, as if they did not
      know of the singular incident which had happened to their faces, and the
      pressure of each to each rather increased than lessened with the lapse of
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      They could hear the excisemen sniffing the air like hounds as they paced
      slowly along. When they reached the spot where the tub had burst, both
      stopped on the instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ay, ay, 'tis quite strong here,' said the second officer. 'Shall we knock
      at the door?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, no,' said Latimer. 'Maybe this is only a trick to put us off the
      scent. They wouldn't kick up this stink anywhere near their hiding- place.
      I have known such things before.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Anyhow, the things, or some of 'em, must have been brought this way,'
      said the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' said Latimer musingly. 'Unless 'tis all done to tole us the wrong
      way. I have a mind that we go home for to-night without saying a word, and
      come the first thing in the morning with more hands. I know they have
      storages about here, but we can do nothing by this owl's light. We will
      look round the parish and see if everybody is in bed, John; and if all is
      quiet, we will do as I say.'
    </p>
    <p>
      They went on, and the two inside the window could hear them passing
      leisurely through the whole village, the street of which curved round at
      the bottom and entered the turnpike road at another junction. This way the
      excisemen followed, and the amble of their horses died quite away.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What will you do?' said Stockdale, withdrawing from his position.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew that he alluded to the coming search by the officers, to divert
      her attention from their own tender incident by the casement, which he
      wished to be passed over as a thing rather dreamt of than done. 'O,
      nothing,' she replied, with as much coolness as she could command under
      her disappointment at his manner. 'We often have such storms as this. You
      would not be frightened if you knew what fools they are. Fancy riding o'
      horseback through the place: of course they will hear and see nobody while
      they make that noise; but they are always afraid to get off, in case some
      of our fellows should burst out upon 'em, and tie them up to the
      gate-post, as they have done before now. Good-night, Mr. Stockdale.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She closed the window and went to her room, where a tear fell from her
      eyes; and that not because of the alertness of the riding-officers.

    <h2>
      VI-THE GREAT SEARCH AT NETHER-MOYNTON
    </h2>
    <p>
      Stockdale was so excited by the events of the evening, and the dilemma
      that he was placed in between conscience and love, that he did not sleep,
      or even doze, but remained as broadly awake as at noonday. As soon as the
      grey light began to touch ever so faintly the whiter objects in his
      bedroom he arose, dressed himself, and went downstairs into the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      The village was already astir. Several of the carriers had heard the
      well-known tramp of Latimer's horse while they were undressing in the dark
      that night, and had already communicated with each other and Owlett on the
      subject. The only doubt seemed to be about the safety of those tubs which
      had been left under the church gallery-stairs, and after a short
      discussion at the corner of the mill, it was agreed that these should be
      removed before it got lighter, and hidden in the middle of a double hedge
      bordering the adjoining field. However, before anything could be carried
      into effect, the footsteps of many men were heard coming down the lane
      from the highway.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Damn it, here they be,' said Owlett, who, having already drawn the hatch
      and started his mill for the day, stood stolidly at the mill-door covered
      with flour, as if the interest of his whole soul was bound up in the
      shaking walls around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two or three with whom he had been talking dispersed to their usual
      work, and when the excise officers, and the formidable body of men they
      had hired, reached the village cross, between the mill and Mrs. Newberry's
      house, the village wore the natural aspect of a place beginning its
      morning labours.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now,' said Latimer to his associates, who numbered thirteen men in all,
      'what I know is that the things are somewhere in this here place. We have
      got the day before us, and 'tis hard if we can't light upon 'em and get
      'em to Budmouth Custom-house before night. First we will try the
      fuel-houses, and then we'll work our way into the chimmers, and then to
      the ricks and stables, and so creep round. You have nothing but your noses
      to guide ye, mind, so use 'em to-day if you never did in your lives
      before.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the search began. Owlett, during the early part, watched from his
      mill-window, Lizzy from the door of her house, with the greatest self-
      possession. A farmer down below, who also had a share in the run, rode
      about with one eye on his fields and the other on Latimer and his
      myrmidons, prepared to put them off the scent if he should be asked a
      question. Stockdale, who was no smuggler at all, felt more anxiety than
      the worst of them, and went about his studies with a heavy heart, coming
      frequently to the door to ask Lizzy some question or other on the
      consequences to her of the tubs being found.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The consequences,' she said quietly, 'are simply that I shall lose 'em.
      As I have none in the house or garden, they can't touch me personally.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But you have some in the orchard?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Owlett rents that of me, and he lends it to others. So it will be hard to
      say who put any tubs there if they should be found.'
    </p>
    <p>
      There was never such a tremendous sniffing known as that which took place
      in Nether-Moynton parish and its vicinity this day. All was done
      methodically, and mostly on hands and knees. At different hours of the day
      they had different plans. From daybreak to breakfast-time the officers
      used their sense of smell in a direct and straightforward manner only,
      pausing nowhere but at such places as the tubs might be supposed to be
      secreted in at that very moment, pending their removal on the following
      night. Among the places tested and examined were
    </p>
    <p>
      Hollow trees Cupboards Culverts Potato-graves Clock-cases Hedgerows
      Fuel-houses Chimney-flues Faggot-ricks Bedrooms Rainwater-butts Haystacks
      Apple-lofts Pigsties Coppers and ovens.
    </p>
    <p>
      After breakfast they recommenced with renewed vigour, taking a new line;
      that is to say, directing their attention to clothes that might be
      supposed to have come in contact with the tubs in their removal from the
      shore, such garments being usually tainted with the spirit, owing to its
      oozing between the staves. They now sniffed at -
    </p>
    <p>
      Smock-frocks Smiths' and shoemakers' aprons Old shirts and waistcoats
      Knee-naps and hedging-gloves Coats and hats Tarpaulins Breeches and
      leggings Market-cloaks Women's shawls and gowns Scarecrows
    </p>
    <p>
      And as soon as the mid-day meal was over, they pushed their search into
      places where the spirits might have been thrown away in alarm:-
    </p>
    <p>
      Horse-ponds Mixens Sinks in yards Stable-drains Wet ditches
      Road-scrapings, and Cinder-heaps Cesspools Back- door gutters.
    </p>
    <p>
      But still these indefatigable excisemen discovered nothing more than the
      original tell-tale smell in the road opposite Lizzy's house, which even
      yet had not passed off.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll tell ye what it is, men,' said Latimer, about three o'clock in the
      afternoon, 'we must begin over again. Find them tubs I will.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The men, who had been hired for the day, looked at their hands and knees,
      muddy with creeping on all fours so frequently, and rubbed their noses, as
      if they had almost had enough of it; for the quantity of bad air which had
      passed into each one's nostril had rendered it nearly as insensible as a
      flue. However, after a moment's hesitation, they prepared to start anew,
      except three, whose power of smell had quite succumbed under the excessive
      wear and tear of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time not a male villager was to be seen in the parish. Owlett was
      not at his mill, the farmers were not in their fields, the parson was not
      in his garden, the smith had left his forge, and the wheelwright's shop
      was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Where the divil are the folk gone?' said Latimer, waking up to the fact
      of their absence, and looking round. 'I'll have 'em up for this! Why don't
      they come and help us? There's not a man about the place but the Methodist
      parson, and he's an old woman. I demand assistance in the king's name!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'We must find the jineral public afore we can demand that,' said his
      lieutenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, well, we shall do better without 'em,' said Latimer, who changed
      his moods at a moment's notice. 'But there's great cause of suspicion in
      this silence and this keeping out of sight, and I'll bear it in mind. Now
      we will go across to Owlett's orchard, and see what we can find there.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Stockdale, who heard this discussion from the garden-gate, over which he
      had been leaning, was rather alarmed, and thought it a mistake of the
      villagers to keep so completely out of the way. He himself, like the
      excisemen, had been wondering for the last half-hour what could have
      become of them. Some labourers were of necessity engaged in distant
      fields, but the master-workmen should have been at home; though one and
      all, after just showing themselves at their shops, had apparently gone off
      for the day. He went in to Lizzy, who sat at a back window sewing, and
      said, 'Lizzy, where are the men?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lizzy laughed. 'Where they mostly are when they're run so hard as this.'
      She cast her eyes to heaven. 'Up there,' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stockdale looked up. 'What-on the top of the church tower?' he asked,
      seeing the direction of her glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I expect they will soon have to come down,' said he gravely. 'I
      have been listening to the officers, and they are going to search the
      orchard over again, and then every nook in the church.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lizzy looked alarmed for the first time. 'Will you go and tell our folk?'
      she said. 'They ought to be let know.' Seeing his conscience struggling
      within him like a boiling pot, she added, 'No, never mind, I'll go
      myself.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She went out, descended the garden, and climbed over the churchyard wall
      at the same time that the preventive-men were ascending the road to the
      orchard. Stockdale could do no less than follow her. By the time that she
      reached the tower entrance he was at her side, and they entered together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nether-Moynton church-tower was, as in many villages, without a turret,
      and the only way to the top was by going up to the singers' gallery, and
      thence ascending by a ladder to a square trap-door in the floor of the
      bell-loft, above which a permanent ladder was fixed, passing through the
      bells to a hole in the roof. When Lizzy and Stockdale reached the gallery
      and looked up, nothing but the trap-door and the five holes for the
      bell-ropes appeared. The ladder was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      'There's no getting up,' said Stockdale.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O yes, there is,' said she. 'There's an eye looking at us at this moment
      through a knot-hole in that trap-door.'
    </p>
    <p>
      And as she spoke the trap opened, and the dark line of the ladder was seen
      descending against the white-washed wall. When it touched the bottom Lizzy
      dragged it to its place, and said, 'If you'll go up, I'll follow.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man ascended, and presently found himself among consecrated
      bells for the first time in his life, nonconformity having been in the
      Stockdale blood for some generations. He eyed them uneasily, and looked
      round for Lizzy. Owlett stood here, holding the top of the ladder.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What, be you really one of us?' said the miller.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It seems so,' said Stockdale sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He's not,' said Lizzy, who overheard. 'He's neither for nor against us.
      He'll do us no harm.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She stepped up beside them, and then they went on to the next stage,
      which, when they had clambered over the dusty bell-carriages, was of easy
      ascent, leading towards the hole through which the pale sky appeared, and
      into the open air. Owlett remained behind for a moment, to pull up the
      lower ladder.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Keep down your heads,' said a voice, as soon as they set foot on the
      flat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stockdale here beheld all the missing parishioners, lying on their
      stomachs on the tower roof, except a few who, elevated on their hands and
      knees, were peeping through the embrasures of the parapet. Stockdale did
      the same, and saw the village lying like a map below him, over which moved
      the figures of the excisemen, each foreshortened to a crablike object, the
      crown of his hat forming a circular disc in the centre of him. Some of the
      men had turned their heads when the young preacher's figure arose among
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What, Mr. Stockdale?' said Matt Grey, in a tone of surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'd as lief that it hadn't been,' said Jim Clarke. 'If the pa'son should
      see him a trespassing here in his tower, 'twould be none the better for
      we, seeing how 'a do hate chapel-members. He'd never buy a tub of us
      again, and he's as good a customer as we have got this side o' Warm'll.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Where is the pa'son?' said Lizzy.
    </p>
    <p>
      'In his house, to be sure, that he mid see nothing of what's going
      on-where all good folks ought to be, and this young man likewise.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, he has brought some news,' said Lizzy. 'They are going to search
      the orchet and church; can we do anything if they should find?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' said her cousin Owlett. 'That's what we've been talking o', and we
      have settled our line. Well, be dazed!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The exclamation was caused by his perceiving that some of the searchers,
      having got into the orchard, and begun stooping and creeping hither and
      thither, were pausing in the middle, where a tree smaller than the rest
      was growing. They drew closer, and bent lower than ever upon the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, my tubs!' said Lizzy faintly, as she peered through the parapet at
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      'They have got 'em, 'a b'lieve,' said Owlett.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interest in the movements of the officers was so keen that not a
      single eye was looking in any other direction; but at that moment a shout
      from the church beneath them attracted the attention of the smugglers, as
      it did also of the party in the orchard, who sprang to their feet and went
      towards the churchyard wall. At the same time those of the Government men
      who had entered the church unperceived by the smugglers cried aloud, 'Here
      be some of 'em at last.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The smugglers remained in a blank silence, uncertain whether 'some of 'em'
      meant tubs or men; but again peeping cautiously over the edge of the tower
      they learnt that tubs were the things descried; and soon these fated
      articles were brought one by one into the middle of the churchyard from
      their hiding-place under the gallery-stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      'They are going to put 'em on Hinton's vault till they find the rest!'
      said Lizzy hopelessly. The excisemen had, in fact, begun to pile up the
      tubs on a large stone slab which was fixed there; and when all were
      brought out from the tower, two or three of the men were left standing by
      them, the rest of the party again proceeding to the orchard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interest of the smugglers in the next manoeuvres of their enemies
      became painfully intense. Only about thirty tubs had been secreted in the
      lumber of the tower, but seventy were hidden in the orchard, making up all
      that they had brought ashore as yet, the remainder of the cargo having
      been tied to a sinker and dropped overboard for another night's
      operations. The excisemen, having re-entered the orchard, acted as if they
      were positive that here lay hidden the rest of the tubs, which they were
      determined to find before nightfall. They spread themselves out round the
      field, and advancing on all fours as before, went anew round every
      apple-tree in the enclosure. The young tree in the middle again led them
      to pause, and at length the whole company gathered there in a way which
      signified that a second chain of reasoning had led to the same results as
      the first.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had examined the sod hereabouts for some minutes, one of the men
      rose, ran to a disused porch of the church where tools were kept, and
      returned with the sexton's pickaxe and shovel, with which they set to
      work.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Are they really buried there?' said the minister, for the grass was so
      green and uninjured that it was difficult to believe it had been
      disturbed. The smugglers were too interested to reply, and presently they
      saw, to their chagrin, the officers stand several on each side of the
      tree; and, stooping and applying their hands to the soil, they bodily
      lifted the tree and the turf around it. The apple-tree now showed itself
      to be growing in a shallow box, with handles for lifting at each of the
      four sides. Under the site of the tree a square hole was revealed, and an
      exciseman went and looked down.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is all up now,' said Owlett quietly. 'And now all of ye get down
      before they notice we are here; and be ready for our next move. I had
      better bide here till dark, or they may take me on suspicion, as 'tis on
      my ground. I'll be with ye as soon as daylight begins to pink in.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And I?' said Lizzy.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You please look to the linch-pins and screws; then go indoors and know
      nothing at all. The chaps will do the rest.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The ladder was replaced, and all but Owlett descended, the men passing off
      one by one at the back of the church, and vanishing on their respective
      errands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lizzy walked boldly along the street, followed closely by the minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are going indoors, Mrs. Newberry?' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew from the words 'Mrs. Newberry' that the division between them had
      widened yet another degree.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am not going home,' she said. 'I have a little thing to do before I go
      in. Martha Sarah will get your tea.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, I don't mean on that account,' said Stockdale. 'What can you have to
      do further in this unhallowed affair?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Only a little,' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What is that? I'll go with you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, I shall go by myself. Will you please go indoors? I shall be there in
      less than an hour.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are not going to run any danger, Lizzy?' said the young man, his
      tenderness reasserting itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      'None whatever-worth mentioning,' answered she, and went down towards the
      Cross.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stockdale entered the garden gate, and stood behind it looking on. The
      excisemen were still busy in the orchard, and at last he was tempted to
      enter, and watch their proceedings. When he came closer he found that the
      secret cellar, of whose existence he had been totally unaware, was formed
      by timbers placed across from side to side about a foot under the ground,
      and grassed over.
    </p>
    <p>
      The excisemen looked up at Stockdale's fair and downy countenance, and
      evidently thinking him above suspicion, went on with their work again. As
      soon as all the tubs were taken out, they began tearing up the turf;
      pulling out the timbers, and breaking in the sides, till the cellar was
      wholly dismantled and shapeless, the apple-tree lying with its roots high
      to the air. But the hole which had in its time held so much contraband
      merchandize was never completely filled up, either then or afterwards, a
      depression in the greensward marking the spot to this day.

    <h2>
      VII-THE WALK TO WARM'ELL CROSS AND AFTERWARDS
    </h2>
    <p>
      As the goods had all to be carried to Budmouth that night, the excisemen's
      next object was to find horses and carts for the journey, and they went
      about the village for that purpose. Latimer strode hither and thither with
      a lump of chalk in his hand, marking broad-arrows so vigorously on every
      vehicle and set of harness that he came across, that it seemed as if he
      would chalk broad-arrows on the very hedges and roads. The owner of every
      conveyance so marked was bound to give it up for Government purposes.
      Stockdale, who had had enough of the scene, turned indoors thoughtful and
      depressed. Lizzy was already there, having come in at the back, though she
      had not yet taken off her bonnet. She looked tired, and her mood was not
      much brighter than his own. They had but little to say to each other; and
      the minister went away and attempted to read; but at this he could not
      succeed, and he shook the little bell for tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lizzy herself brought in the tray, the girl having run off into the
      village during the afternoon, too full of excitement at the proceedings to
      remember her state of life. However, almost before the sad lovers had said
      anything to each other, Martha came in in a steaming state.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, there's such a stoor, Mrs. Newberry and Mr. Stockdale! The king's
      excisemen can't get the carts ready nohow at all! They pulled Thomas
      Ballam's, and William Rogers's, and Stephen Sprake's carts into the road,
      and off came the wheels, and down fell the carts; and they found there was
      no linch-pins in the arms; and then they tried Samuel Shane's waggon, and
      found that the screws were gone from he, and at last they looked at the
      dairyman's cart, and he's got none neither! They have gone now to the
      blacksmith's to get some made, but he's nowhere to be found!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Stockdale looked at Lizzy, who blushed very slightly, and went out of the
      room, followed by Martha Sarah. But before they had got through the
      passage there was a rap at the front door, and Stockdale recognized
      Latimer's voice addressing Mrs. Newberry, who had turned back.
    </p>
    <p>
      'For God's sake, Mrs. Newberry, have you seen Hardman the blacksmith up
      this way? If we could get hold of him, we'd e'en a'most drag him by the
      hair of his head to his anvil, where he ought to be.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He's an idle man, Mr. Latimer,' said Lizzy archly. 'What do you want him
      for?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, there isn't a horse in the place that has got more than three shoes
      on, and some have only two. The waggon-wheels be without strakes, and
      there's no linch-pins to the carts. What with that, and the bother about
      every set of harness being out of order, we shan't be off before
      nightfall-upon my soul we shan't. 'Tis a rough lot, Mrs. Newberry, that
      you've got about you here; but they'll play at this game once too often,
      mark my words they will! There's not a man in the parish that don't
      deserve to be whipped.'
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened that Hardman was at that moment a little further up the lane,
      smoking his pipe behind a holly-bush. When Latimer had done speaking he
      went on in this direction, and Hardman, hearing the exciseman's steps,
      found curiosity too strong for prudence. He peeped out from the bush at
      the very moment that Latimer's glance was on it. There was nothing left
      for him to do but to come forward with unconcern.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I've been looking for you for the last hour!' said Latimer with a glare
      in his eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sorry to hear that,' said Hardman. 'I've been out for a stroll, to look
      for more hid tubs, to deliver 'em up to Gover'ment.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O yes, Hardman, we know it,' said Latimer, with withering sarcasm. 'We
      know that you'll deliver 'em up to Gover'ment. We know that all the parish
      is helping us, and have been all day! Now you please walk along with me
      down to your shop, and kindly let me hire ye in the king's name.'
    </p>
    <p>
      They went down the lane together; and presently there resounded from the
      smithy the ring of a hammer not very briskly swung. However, the carts and
      horses were got into some sort of travelling condition, but it was not
      until after the clock had struck six, when the muddy roads were glistening
      under the horizontal light of the fading day. The smuggled tubs were soon
      packed into the vehicles, and Latimer, with three of his assistants, drove
      slowly out of the village in the direction of the port of Budmouth, some
      considerable number of miles distant, the other excisemen being left to
      watch for the remainder of the cargo, which they knew to have been sunk
      somewhere between Ringsworth and Lulstead Cove, and to unearth Owlett, the
      only person clearly implicated by the discovery of the cave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Women and children stood at the doors as the carts, each chalked with the
      Government pitchfork, passed in the increasing twilight; and as they stood
      they looked at the confiscated property with a melancholy expression that
      told only too plainly the relation which they bore to the trade.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, Lizzy,' said Stockdale, when the crackle of the wheels had nearly
      died away. 'This is a fit finish to your adventure. I am truly thankful
      that you have got off without suspicion, and the loss only of the liquor.
      Will you sit down and let me talk to you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'By and by,' she said. 'But I must go out now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not to that horrid shore again?' he said blankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, not there. I am only going to see the end of this day's business.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not answer to this, and she moved towards the door slowly, as if
      waiting for him to say something more.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You don't offer to come with me,' she added at last. 'I suppose that's
      because you hate me after all this?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Can you say it, Lizzy, when you know I only want to save you from such
      practices? Come with you of course I will, if it is only to take care of
      you. But why will you go out again?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Because I cannot rest indoors. Something is happening, and I must know
      what. Now, come!' And they went into the dusk together.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they reached the turnpike-road she turned to the right, and he soon
      perceived that they were following the direction of the excisemen and
      their load. He had given her his arm, and every now and then she suddenly
      pulled it back, to signify that he was to halt a moment and listen. They
      had walked rather quickly along the first quarter of a mile, and on the
      second or third time of standing still she said, 'I hear them ahead-don't
      you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' he said; 'I hear the wheels. But what of that?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I only want to know if they get clear away from the neighbourhood.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah,' said he, a light breaking upon him. 'Something desperate is to be
      attempted!-and now I remember there was not a man about the village when
      we left.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hark!' she murmured. The noise of the cartwheels had stopped, and given
      place to another sort of sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      ''Tis a scuffle!' said Stockdale. 'There'll be murder! Lizzy, let go my
      arm; I am going on. On my conscience, I must not stay here and do
      nothing!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'There'll be no murder, and not even a broken head,' she said. 'Our men
      are thirty to four of them: no harm will be done at all.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then there is an attack!' exclaimed Stockdale; 'and you knew it was to
      be. Why should you side with men who break the laws like this?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why should you side with men who take from country traders what they have
      honestly bought wi' their own money in France?' said she firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'They are not honestly bought,' said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      'They are,' she contradicted. 'I and Owlett and the others paid thirty
      shillings for every one of the tubs before they were put on board at
      Cherbourg, and if a king who is nothing to us sends his people to steal
      our property, we have a right to steal it back again.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Stockdale did not stop to argue the matter, but went quickly in the
      direction of the noise, Lizzy keeping at his side. 'Don't you interfere,
      will you, dear Richard?' she said anxiously, as they drew near. 'Don't let
      us go any closer: 'tis at Warm'ell Cross where they are seizing 'em. You
      can do no good, and you may meet with a hard blow!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Let us see first what is going on,' he said. But before they had got much
      further the noise of the cartwheels began again; and Stockdale soon found
      that they were coming towards him. In another minute the three carts came
      up, and Stockdale and Lizzy stood in the ditch to let them pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of being conducted by four men, as had happened when they went out
      of the village, the horses and carts were now accompanied by a body of
      from twenty to thirty, all of whom, as Stockdale perceived to his
      astonishment, had blackened faces. Among them walked six or eight huge
      female figures, whom, from their wide strides, Stockdale guessed to be men
      in disguise. As soon as the party discerned Lizzy and her companion four
      or five fell back, and when the carts had passed, came close to the pair.
    </p>
    <p>
      'There is no walking up this way for the present,' said one of the gaunt
      women, who wore curls a foot long, dangling down the sides of her face, in
      the fashion of the time. Stockdale recognized this lady's voice as
      Owlett's.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why not?' said Stockdale. 'This is the public highway.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now look here, youngster,' said Owlett. 'O, 'tis the Methodist
      parson!-what, and Mrs. Newberry! Well, you'd better not go up that way,
      Lizzy. They've all run off, and folks have got their own again.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The miller then hastened on and joined his comrades. Stockdale and Lizzy
      also turned back. 'I wish all this hadn't been forced upon us,' she said
      regretfully. 'But if those excisemen had got off with the tubs, half the
      people in the parish would have been in want for the next month or two.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Stockdale was not paying much attention to her words, and he said, 'I
      don't think I can go back like this. Those four poor excisemen may be
      murdered for all I know.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Murdered!' said Lizzy impatiently. 'We don't do murder here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I shall go as far as Warm'ell Cross to see,' said Stockdale
      decisively; and, without wishing her safe home or anything else, the
      minister turned back. Lizzy stood looking at him till his form was
      absorbed in the shades; and then, with sadness, she went in the direction
      of Nether-Moynton.
    </p>
    <p>
      The road was lonely, and after nightfall at this time of the year there
      was often not a passer for hours. Stockdale pursued his way without
      hearing a sound beyond that of his own footsteps; and in due time he
      passed beneath the trees of the plantation which surrounded the Warm'ell
      Cross-road. Before he had reached the point of intersection he heard
      voices from the thicket.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hoi-hoi-hoi! Help, help!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The voices were not at all feeble or despairing, but they were
      unmistakably anxious. Stockdale had no weapon, and before plunging into
      the pitchy darkness of the plantation he pulled a stake from the hedge, to
      use in case of need. When he got among the trees he shouted-'What's the
      matter-where are you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Here,' answered the voices; and, pushing through the brambles in that
      direction, he came near the objects of his search.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why don't you come forward?' said Stockdale.
    </p>
    <p>
      'We be tied to the trees!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who are you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Poor Will Latimer the exciseman!' said one plaintively. 'Just come and
      cut these cords, there's a good man. We were afraid nobody would pass by
      to-night.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Stockdale soon loosened them, upon which they stretched their limbs and
      stood at their ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The rascals!' said Latimer, getting now into a rage, though he had seemed
      quite meek when Stockdale first came up. ''Tis the same set of fellows. I
      know they were Moynton chaps to a man.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But we can't swear to 'em,' said another. 'Not one of 'em spoke.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What are you going to do?' said Stockdale.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'd fain go back to Moynton, and have at 'em again!' said Latimer.
    </p>
    <p>
      'So would we!' said his comrades.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Fight till we die!' said Latimer.
    </p>
    <p>
      'We will, we will!' said his men.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But,' said Latimer, more frigidly, as they came out of the plantation,
      'we don't know that these chaps with black faces were Moynton men? And
      proof is a hard thing.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'So it is,' said the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And therefore we won't do nothing at all,' said Latimer, with complete
      dispassionateness. 'For my part, I'd sooner be them than we. The clitches
      of my arms are burning like fire from the cords those two strapping women
      tied round 'em. My opinion is, now I have had time to think o't, that you
      may serve your Gover'ment at too high a price. For these two nights and
      days I have not had an hour's rest; and, please God, here's for
      home-along.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The other officers agreed heartily to this course; and, thanking Stockdale
      for his timely assistance, they parted from him at the Cross, taking
      themselves the western road, and Stockdale going back to Nether- Moynton.
    </p>
    <p>
      During that walk the minister was lost in reverie of the most painful
      kind. As soon as he got into the house, and before entering his own rooms,
      he advanced to the door of the little back parlour in which Lizzy usually
      sat with her mother. He found her there alone. Stockdale went forward,
      and, like a man in a dream, looked down upon the table that stood between
      him and the young woman, who had her bonnet and cloak still on. As he did
      not speak, she looked up from her chair at him, with misgiving in her eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Where are they gone?' he then said listlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who?-I don't know. I have seen nothing of them since. I came straight in
      here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If your men can manage to get off with those tubs, it will be a great
      profit to you, I suppose?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A share will be mine, a share my cousin Owlett's, a share to each of the
      two farmers, and a share divided amongst the men who helped us.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And you still think,' he went on slowly, 'that you will not give this
      business up?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lizzy rose, and put her hand upon his shoulder. 'Don't ask that,' she
      whispered. 'You don't know what you are asking. I must tell you, though I
      meant not to do it. What I make by that trade is all I have to keep my
      mother and myself with.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He was astonished. 'I did not dream of such a thing,' he said. 'I would
      rather have swept the streets, had I been you. What is money compared with
      a clear conscience?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'My conscience is clear. I know my mother, but the king I have never seen.
      His dues are nothing to me. But it is a great deal to me that my mother
      and I should live.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Marry me, and promise to give it up. I will keep your mother.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is good of you,' she said, trembling a little. 'Let me think of it by
      myself. I would rather not answer now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She reserved her answer till the next day, and came into his room with a
      solemn face. 'I cannot do what you wished!' she said passionately. 'It is
      too much to ask. My whole life ha' been passed in this way.' Her words and
      manner showed that before entering she had been struggling with herself in
      private, and that the contention had been strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stockdale turned pale, but he spoke quietly. 'Then, Lizzy, we must part. I
      cannot go against my principles in this matter, and I cannot make my
      profession a mockery. You know how I love you, and what I would do for
      you; but this one thing I cannot do.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But why should you belong to that profession?' she burst out. 'I have got
      this large house; why can't you marry me, and live here with us, and not
      be a Methodist preacher any more? I assure you, Richard, it is no harm,
      and I wish you could only see it as I do! We only carry it on in winter:
      in summer it is never done at all. It stirs up one's dull life at this
      time o' the year, and gives excitement, which I have got so used to now
      that I should hardly know how to do 'ithout it. At nights, when the wind
      blows, instead of being dull and stupid, and not noticing whether it do
      blow or not, your mind is afield, even if you are not afield yourself; and
      you are wondering how the chaps are getting on; and you walk up and down
      the room, and look out o' window, and then you go out yourself, and know
      your way about as well by night as by day, and have hairbreadth escapes
      from old Latimer and his fellows, who are too stupid ever to really
      frighten us, and only make us a bit nimble.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He frightened you a little last night, anyhow: and I would advise you to
      drop it before it is worse.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head. 'No, I must go on as I have begun. I was born to it.
      It is in my blood, and I can't be cured. O, Richard, you cannot think what
      a hard thing you have asked, and how sharp you try me when you put me
      between this and my love for 'ee!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Stockdale was leaning with his elbow on the mantelpiece, his hands over
      his eyes. 'We ought never to have met, Lizzy,' he said. 'It was an ill day
      for us! I little thought there was anything so hopeless and impossible in
      our engagement as this. Well, it is too late now to regret consequences in
      this way. I have had the happiness of seeing you and knowing you at
      least.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You dissent from Church, and I dissent from State,' she said. 'And I
      don't see why we are not well matched.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled sadly, while Lizzy remained looking down, her eyes beginning to
      overflow.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was an unhappy evening for both of them, and the days that followed
      were unhappy days. Both she and he went mechanically about their
      employments, and his depression was marked in the village by more than one
      of his denomination with whom he came in contact. But Lizzy, who passed
      her days indoors, was unsuspected of being the cause: for it was generally
      understood that a quiet engagement to marry existed between her and her
      cousin Owlett, and had existed for some time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus uncertainly the week passed on; till one morning Stockdale said to
      her: 'I have had a letter, Lizzy. I must call you that till I am gone.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Gone?' said she blankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' he said. 'I am going from this place. I felt it would be better for
      us both that I should not stay after what has happened. In fact, I
      couldn't stay here, and look on you from day to day, without becoming weak
      and faltering in my course. I have just heard of an arrangement by which
      the other minister can arrive here in about a week; and let me go
      elsewhere.'
    </p>
    <p>
      That he had all this time continued so firmly fixed in his resolution came
      upon her as a grievous surprise. 'You never loved me!' she said bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I might say the same,' he returned; 'but I will not. Grant me one favour.
      Come and hear my last sermon on the day before I go.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lizzy, who was a church-goer on Sunday mornings, frequently attended
      Stockdale's chapel in the evening with the rest of the double-minded; and
      she promised.
    </p>
    <p>
      It became known that Stockdale was going to leave, and a good many people
      outside his own sect were sorry to hear it. The intervening days flew
      rapidly away, and on the evening of the Sunday which preceded the morning
      of his departure Lizzy sat in the chapel to hear him for the last time.
      The little building was full to overflowing, and he took up the subject
      which all had expected, that of the contraband trade so extensively
      practised among them. His hearers, in laying his words to their own
      hearts, did not perceive that they were most particularly directed against
      Lizzy, till the sermon waxed warm, and Stockdale nearly broke down with
      emotion. In truth his own earnestness, and her sad eyes looking up at him,
      were too much for the young man's equanimity. He hardly knew how he ended.
      He saw Lizzy, as through a mist, turn and go away with the rest of the
      congregation; and shortly afterwards followed her home.
    </p>
    <p>
      She invited him to supper, and they sat down alone, her mother having, as
      was usual with her on Sunday nights, gone to bed early.
    </p>
    <p>
      'We will part friends, won't we?' said Lizzy, with forced gaiety, and
      never alluding to the sermon: a reticence which rather disappointed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'We will,' he said, with a forced smile on his part; and they sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the first meal that they had ever shared together in their lives,
      and probably the last that they would so share. When it was over, and the
      indifferent conversation could no longer be continued, he arose and took
      her hand. 'Lizzy,' he said, 'do you say we must part-do you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You do,' she said solemnly. 'I can say no more.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nor I,' said he. 'If that is your answer, good-bye!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Stockdale bent over her and kissed her, and she involuntarily returned his
      kiss. 'I shall go early,' he said hurriedly. 'I shall not see you again.'
    </p>
    <p>
      And he did leave early. He fancied, when stepping forth into the grey
      morning light, to mount the van which was to carry him away, that he saw a
      face between the parted curtains of Lizzy's window, but the light was
      faint, and the panes glistened with wet; so he could not be sure.
      Stockdale mounted the vehicle, and was gone; and on the following Sunday
      the new minister preached in the chapel of the Moynton Wesleyans.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, two years after the parting, Stockdale, now settled in a midland
      town, came into Nether-Moynton by carrier in the original way. Jogging
      along in the van that afternoon he had put questions to the driver, and
      the answers that he received interested the minister deeply. The result of
      them was that he went without the least hesitation to the door of his
      former lodging. It was about six o'clock in the evening, and the same time
      of year as when he had left; now, too, the ground was damp and glistening,
      the west was bright, and Lizzy's snowdrops were raising their heads in the
      border under the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lizzy must have caught sight of him from the window, for by the time that
      he reached the door she was there holding it open: and then, as if she had
      not sufficiently considered her act of coming out, she drew herself back,
      saying with some constraint, 'Mr. Stockdale!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You knew it was,' said Stockdale, taking her hand. 'I wrote to say I
      should call.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, but you did not say when,' she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I did not. I was not quite sure when my business would lead me to these
      parts.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You only came because business brought you near?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, that is the fact; but I have often thought I should like to come on
      purpose to see you . . . But what's all this that has happened? I told you
      how it would be, Lizzy, and you would not listen to me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I would not,' she said sadly. 'But I had been brought up to that life;
      and it was second nature to me. However, it is all over now. The officers
      have blood-money for taking a man dead or alive, and the trade is going to
      nothing. We were hunted down like rats.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Owlett is quite gone, I hear.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. He is in America. We had a dreadful struggle that last time, when
      they tried to take him. It is a perfect miracle that he lived through it;
      and it is a wonder that I was not killed. I was shot in the hand. It was
      not by aim; the shot was really meant for my cousin; but I was behind,
      looking on as usual, and the bullet came to me. It bled terribly, but I
      got home without fainting; and it healed after a time. You know how he
      suffered?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No,' said Stockdale. 'I only heard that he just escaped with his life.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He was shot in the back; but a rib turned the ball. He was badly hurt. We
      would not let him be took. The men carried him all night across the meads
      to Kingsbere, and hid him in a barn, dressing his wound as well as they
      could, till he was so far recovered as to be able to get about. He had
      gied up his mill for some time; and at last he got to Bristol, and took a
      passage to America, and he's settled in Wisconsin.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What do you think of smuggling now?' said the minister gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I own that we were wrong,' said she. 'But I have suffered for it. I am
      very poor now, and my mother has been dead these twelve months . . . But
      won't you come in, Mr. Stockdale?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Stockdale went in; and it is to be supposed that they came to an
      understanding; for a fortnight later there was a sale of Lizzy's
      furniture, and after that a wedding at a chapel in a neighbouring town.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took her away from her old haunts to the home that he had made for
      himself in his native county, where she studied her duties as a minister's
      wife with praiseworthy assiduity. It is said that in after years she wrote
      an excellent tract called Render unto Caesar; or, The Repentant Villagers,
      in which her own experience was anonymously used as the introductory
      story. Stockdale got it printed, after making some corrections, and
      putting in a few powerful sentences of his own; and many hundreds of
      copies were distributed by the couple in the course of their married life.

      PREFATORY NOTE
    </h2>
    <p>
      I reprint in this volume, for what they may be worth, a dozen minor novels

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <p>
      The person who, next to the actors themselves, chanced to know most of
      their story, lived just below 'Top o' Town' (as the spot was called) in an
      old substantially-built house, distinguished among its neighbours by
      having an oriel window on the first floor, whence could be obtained a
      raking view of the High Street, west and east, the former including
      Laura's dwelling, the end of the Town Avenue hard by (in which were played
      the odd pranks hereafter to be mentioned), the Port-Bredy road rising
      westwards, and the turning that led to the cavalry barracks where the
      Captain was quartered. Looking eastward down the town from the same
      favoured gazebo, the long perspective of houses declined and dwindled till
      they merged in the highway across the moor. The white riband of road
      disappeared over Grey's Bridge a quarter of a mile off, to plunge into
      innumerable rustic windings, shy shades, and solitary undulations up hill
      and down dale for one hundred and twenty miles till it exhibited itself at
      Hyde Park Corner as a smooth bland surface in touch with a busy and
      fashionable world.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the barracks aforesaid had recently arrived the &mdash;-th Hussars, a
      regiment new to the locality. Almost before any acquaintance with its
      members had been made by the townspeople, a report spread that they were a
      'crack' body of men, and had brought a splendid band. For some reason or
      other the town had not been used as the headquarters of cavalry for many
      years, the various troops stationed there having consisted of casual
      detachments only; so that it was with a sense of honour that
      everybody-even the small furniture-broker from whom the married troopers
      hired tables and chairs-received the news of their crack quality.
    </p>
    <p>
      In those days the Hussar regiments still wore over the left shoulder that
      attractive attachment, or frilled half-coat, hanging loosely behind like
      the wounded wing of a bird, which was called the pelisse, though it was
      known among the troopers themselves as a 'sling-jacket.' It added
      amazingly to their picturesqueness in women's eyes, and, indeed, in the
      eyes of men also.
    </p>
    <p>
      The burgher who lived in the house with the oriel window sat during a
      great many hours of the day in that projection, for he was an invalid, and
      time hung heavily on his hands unless he maintained a constant interest in
      proceedings without. Not more than a week after the arrival of the Hussars
      his ears were assailed by the shout of one schoolboy to another in the
      street below.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Have 'ee heard this about the Hussars? They are haunted! Yes-a ghost
      troubles 'em; he has followed 'em about the world for years.'
    </p>
    <p>
      A haunted regiment: that was a new idea for either invalid or stalwart.
      The listener in the oriel came to the conclusion that there were some
      lively characters among the &mdash;-th Hussars.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made Captain Maumbry's acquaintance in an informal manner at an
      afternoon tea to which he went in a wheeled chair-one of the very rare
      outings that the state of his health permitted. Maumbry showed himself to
      be a handsome man of twenty-eight or thirty, with an attractive hint of
      wickedness in his manner that was sure to make him adorable with good
      young women. The large dark eyes that lit his pale face expressed this
      wickedness strongly, though such was the adaptability of their rays that
      one could think they might have expressed sadness or seriousness just as
      readily, if he had had a mind for such.
    </p>
    <p>
      An old and deaf lady who was present asked Captain Maumbry bluntly:
      'What's this we hear about you? They say your regiment is haunted.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain's face assumed an aspect of grave, even sad, concern. 'Yes,'
      he replied, 'it is too true.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Some younger ladies smiled till they saw how serious he looked, when they
      looked serious likewise.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Really?' said the old lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. We naturally don't wish to say much about it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, no; of course not. But-how haunted?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well; the-thing, as I'll call it, follows us. In country quarters or
      town, abroad or at home, it's just the same.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How do you account for it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'H'm.' Maumbry lowered his voice. 'Some crime committed by certain of our
      regiment in past years, we suppose.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dear me . . . How very horrid, and singular!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But, as I said, we don't speak of it much.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No . . . no.'
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Hussar was gone, a young lady, disclosing a long-suppressed
      interest, asked if the ghost had been seen by any of the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer's son, who always had the latest borough news, said that,
      though it was seldom seen by any one but the Hussars themselves, more than
      one townsman and woman had already set eyes on it, to his or her terror.
      The phantom mostly appeared very late at night, under the dense trees of
      the town-avenue nearest the barracks. It was about ten feet high; its
      teeth chattered with a dry naked sound, as if they were those of a
      skeleton; and its hip-bones could be heard grating in their sockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the darkest weeks of winter several timid persons were seriously
      frightened by the object answering to this cheerful description, and the
      police began to look into the matter. Whereupon the appearances grew less
      frequent, and some of the Boys of the regiment thankfully stated that they
      had not been so free from ghostly visitation for years as they had become
      since their arrival in Casterbridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      This playing at ghosts was the most innocent of the amusements indulged in
      by the choice young spirits who inhabited the lichened, red-brick building
      at the top of the town bearing 'W.D.' and a broad arrow on its quoins. Far
      more serious escapades-levities relating to love, wine, cards,
      betting-were talked of, with no doubt more or less of exaggeration. That
      the Hussars, Captain Maumbry included, were the cause of bitter tears to
      several young women of the town and country is unquestionably true,
      despite the fact that the gaieties of the young men wore a more staring
      colour in this old-fashioned place than they would have done in a large
      and modern city.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Regularly once a week they rode out in marching order.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Returning up the town on one of these occasions, the romantic pelisse
      flapping behind each horseman's shoulder in the soft south-west wind,
      Captain Maumbry glanced up at the oriel. A mutual nod was exchanged
      between him and the person who sat there reading. The reader and a friend
      in the room with him followed the troop with their eyes all the way up the
      street, till, when the soldiers were opposite the house in which Laura
      lived, that young lady became discernible in the balcony.
    </p>
    <p>
      'They are engaged to be married, I hear,' said the friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who-Maumbry and Laura? Never-so soon?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He'll never marry. Several girls have been mentioned in connection with
      his name. I am sorry for Laura.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, but you needn't be. They are excellently matched.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She's only one more.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She's one more, and more still. She has regularly caught him. She is a
      born player of the game of hearts, and she knew how to beat him in his own
      practices. If there is one woman in the town who has any chance of holding
      her own and marrying him, she is that woman.'
    </p>
    <p>
      This was true, as it turned out. By natural proclivity Laura had from the
      first entered heart and soul into military romance as exhibited in the
      plots and characters of those living exponents of it who came under her
      notice. From her earliest young womanhood civilians, however promising,
      had no chance of winning her interest if the meanest warrior were within
      the horizon. It may be that the position of her uncle's house (which was
      her home) at the corner of West Street nearest the barracks, the daily
      passing of the troops, the constant blowing of trumpet-calls a furlong
      from her windows, coupled with the fact that she knew nothing of the inner
      realities of military life, and hence idealized it, had also helped her
      mind's original bias for thinking men- at-arms the only ones worthy of a
      woman's heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Maumbry was a typical prize; one whom all surrounding maidens had
      coveted, ached for, angled for, wept for, had by her judicious management
      become subdued to her purpose; and in addition to the pleasure of marrying
      the man she loved, Laura had the joy of feeling herself hated by the
      mothers of all the marriageable girls of the neighbourhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man in the oriel went to the wedding; not as a guest, for at this time
      he was but slightly acquainted with the parties; but mainly because the
      church was close to his house; partly, too, for a reason which moved many
      others to be spectators of the ceremony; a subconsciousness that, though
      the couple might be happy in their experiences, there was sufficient
      possibility of their being otherwise to colour the musings of an onlooker
      with a pleasing pathos of conjecture. He could on occasion do a pretty
      stroke of rhyming in those days, and he beguiled the time of waiting by
      pencilling on a blank page of his prayer-book a few lines which, though
      kept private then, may be given here:-
    </p>
    <h3>
      AT A HASTY WEDDING
    </h3>
    <p>
      (Triolet)
    </p>
    <p>
      If hours be years the twain are blest, For now they solace swift desire By
      lifelong ties that tether zest If hours be years. The twain are blest Do
      eastern suns slope never west, Nor pallid ashes follow fire. If hours be
      years the twain are blest For now they solace swift desire.
    </p>
    <p>
      As if, however, to falsify all prophecies, the couple seemed to find in
      marriage the secret of perpetuating the intoxication of a courtship which,
      on Maumbry's side at least, had opened without serious intent. During the
      winter following they were the most popular pair in and about
      Casterbridge-nay in South Wessex itself. No smart dinner in the country
      houses of the younger and gayer families within driving distance of the
      borough was complete without their lively presence; Mrs. Maumbry was the
      blithest of the whirling figures at the county ball; and when followed
      that inevitable incident of garrison-town life, an amateur dramatic
      entertainment, it was just the same. The acting was for the benefit of
      such and such an excellent charity-nobody cared what, provided the play
      were played-and both Captain Maumbry and his wife were in the piece,
      having been in fact, by mutual consent, the originators of the
      performance. And so with laughter, and thoughtlessness, and movement, all
      went merrily. There was a little backwardness in the bill-paying of the
      couple; but in justice to them it must be added that sooner or later all
      owings were paid.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <p>
      At the chapel-of-ease attended by the troops there arose above the edge of
      the pulpit one Sunday an unknown face. This was the face of a new curate.
      He placed upon the desk, not the familiar sermon book, but merely a Bible.
      The person who tells these things was not present at that service, but he
      soon learnt that the young curate was nothing less than a great surprise
      to his congregation; a mixed one always, for though the Hussars occupied
      the body of the building, its nooks and corners were crammed with
      civilians, whom, up to the present, even the least uncharitable would have
      described as being attracted thither less by the services than by the
      soldiery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now there arose a second reason for squeezing into an already overcrowded
      church. The persuasive and gentle eloquence of Mr. Sainway operated like a
      charm upon those accustomed only to the higher and dryer styles of
      preaching, and for a time the other churches of the town were thinned of
      their sitters.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point in the nineteenth century the sermon was the sole reason for
      churchgoing amongst a vast body of religious people. The liturgy was a
      formal preliminary, which, like the Royal proclamation in a court of
      assize, had to be got through before the real interest began; and on
      reaching home the question was simply: Who preached, and how did he handle
      his subject? Even had an archbishop officiated in the service proper
      nobody would have cared much about what was said or sung. People who had
      formerly attended in the morning only began to go in the evening, and even
      to the special addresses in the afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day when Captain Maumbry entered his wife's drawing-room, filled with
      hired furniture, she thought he was somebody else, for he had not come
      upstairs humming the most catching air afloat in musical circles or in his
      usual careless way.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What's the matter, Jack?' she said without looking up from a note she was
      writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well-not much, that I know.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, but there is,' she murmured as she wrote.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why-this cursed new lath in a sheet-I mean the new parson! He wants us to
      stop the band-playing on Sunday afternoons.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura looked up aghast.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, it is the one thing that enables the few rational beings hereabouts
      to keep alive from Saturday to Monday!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He says all the town flock to the music and don't come to the service,
      and that the pieces played are profane, or mundane, or inane, or
      something-not what ought to be played on Sunday. Of course 'tis Lautmann
      who settles those things.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lautmann was the bandmaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      The barrack-green on Sunday afternoons had, indeed, become the promenade
      of a great many townspeople cheerfully inclined, many even of those who
      attended in the morning at Mr. Sainway's service; and little boys who
      ought to have been listening to the curate's afternoon lecture were too
      often seen rolling upon the grass and making faces behind the more
      dignified listeners.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura heard no more about the matter, however, for two or three weeks,
      when suddenly remembering it she asked her husband if any further
      objections had been raised.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O-Mr. Sainway. I forgot to tell you. I've made his acquaintance. He is
      not a bad sort of man.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura asked if either Maumbry or some others of the officers did not give
      the presumptuous curate a good setting down for his interference.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O well-we've forgotten that. He's a stunning preacher, they tell me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The acquaintance developed apparently, for the Captain said to her a
      little later on, 'There's a good deal in Sainway's argument about having
      no band on Sunday afternoons. After all, it is close to his church. But he
      doesn't press his objections unduly.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am surprised to hear you defend him!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It was only a passing thought of mine. We naturally don't wish to offend
      the inhabitants of the town if they don't like it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But they do.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The invalid in the oriel never clearly gathered the details of progress in
      this conflict of lay and clerical opinion; but so it was that, to the
      disappointment of musicians, the grief of out-walking lovers, and the
      regret of the junior population of the town and country round, the band-
      playing on Sunday afternoons ceased in Casterbridge barrack-square.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time the Maumbrys had frequently listened to the preaching of the
      gentle if narrow-minded curate; for these light-natured, hit-or- miss,
      rackety people went to church like others for respectability's sake. None
      so orthodox as your unmitigated worldling. A more remarkable event was the
      sight to the man in the window of Captain Maumbry and Mr. Sainway walking
      down the High Street in earnest conversation. On his mentioning this fact
      to a caller he was assured that it was a matter of common talk that they
      were always together.
    </p>
    <p>
      The observer would soon have learnt this with his own eyes if he had not
      been told. They began to pass together nearly every day. Hitherto Mrs.
      Maumbry, in fashionable walking clothes, had usually been her husband's
      companion; but this was less frequent now. The close and singular
      friendship between the two men went on for nearly a year, when Mr. Sainway
      was presented to a living in a densely-populated town in the midland
      counties. He bade the parishioners of his old place a reluctant farewell
      and departed, the touching sermon he preached on the occasion being
      published by the local printer. Everybody was sorry to lose him; and it
      was with genuine grief that his Casterbridge congregation learnt later on
      that soon after his induction to his benefice, during some bitter weather,
      he had fallen seriously ill of inflammation of the lungs, of which he
      eventually died.
    </p>
    <p>
      We now get below the surface of things. Of all who had known the dead
      curate, none grieved for him like the man who on his first arrival had
      called him a 'lath in a sheet.' Mrs. Maumbry had never greatly sympathized
      with the impressive parson; indeed, she had been secretly glad that he had
      gone away to better himself. He had considerably diminished the pleasures
      of a woman by whom the joys of earth and good company had been appreciated
      to the full. Sorry for her husband in his loss of a friend who had been
      none of hers, she was yet quite unprepared for the sequel.
    </p>
    <p>
      'There is something that I have wanted to tell you lately, dear,' he said
      one morning at breakfast with hesitation. 'Have you guessed what it is?'
    </p>
    <p>
      She had guessed nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      'That I think of retiring from the army.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have thought more and more of Sainway since his death, and of what he
      used to say to me so earnestly. And I feel certain I shall be right in
      obeying a call within me to give up this fighting trade and enter the
      Church.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What-be a parson?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But what should I do?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Be a parson's wife.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never!' she affirmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But how can you help it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll run away rather!' she said vehemently;
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, you mustn't,' Maumbry replied, in the tone he used when his mind was
      made up. 'You'll get accustomed to the idea, for I am constrained to carry
      it out, though it is against my worldly interests. I am forced on by a
      Hand outside me to tread in the steps of Sainway.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Jack,' she asked, with calm pallor and round eyes; 'do you mean to say
      seriously that you are arranging to be a curate instead of a soldier?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I might say a curate is a soldier-of the church militant; but I don't
      want to offend you with doctrine. I distinctly say, yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Late one evening, a little time onward, he caught her sitting by the dim
      firelight in her room. She did not know he had entered; and he found her
      weeping. 'What are you crying about, poor dearest?' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She started. 'Because of what you have told me!' The Captain grew very
      unhappy; but he was undeterred.
    </p>
    <p>
      In due time the town learnt, to its intense surprise, that Captain Maumbry
      had retired from the &mdash;-th Hussars and gone to Fountall Theological
      College to prepare for the ministry.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      'O, the pity of it! Such a dashing soldier-so popular-such an acquisition
      to the town-the soul of social life here! And now! . . . One should not
      speak ill of the dead, but that dreadful Mr. Sainway-it was too cruel of
      him!'
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a summary of what was said when Captain, now the Reverend, John
      Maumbry was enabled by circumstances to indulge his heart's desire of
      returning to the scene of his former exploits in the capacity of a
      minister of the Gospel. A low-lying district of the town, which at that
      date was crowded with impoverished cottagers, was crying for a curate, and
      Mr. Maumbry generously offered himself as one willing to undertake labours
      that were certain to produce little result, and no thanks, credit, or
      emolument.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let the truth be told about him as a clergyman; he proved to be anything
      but a brilliant success. Painstaking, single-minded, deeply in earnest as
      all could see, his delivery was laboured, his sermons were dull to listen
      to, and alas, too, too long. Even the dispassionate judges who sat by the
      hour in the bar-parlour of the White Hart-an inn standing at the dividing
      line between the poor quarter aforesaid and the fashionable quarter of
      Maumbry's former triumphs, and hence affording a position of strict
      impartiality-agreed in substance with the young ladies to the westward,
      though their views were somewhat more tersely expressed: 'Surely, God
      A'mighty spwiled a good sojer to make a bad pa'son when He shifted Cap'n
      Ma'mbry into a sarpless!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter knew that such things were said, but he pursued his daily'
      labours in and out of the hovels with serene unconcern.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was about this time that the invalid in the oriel became more than a
      mere bowing acquaintance of Mrs. Maumbry's. She had returned to the town
      with her husband, and was living with him in a little house in the centre
      of his circle of ministration, when by some means she became one of the
      invalid's visitors. After a general conversation while sitting in his room
      with a friend of both, an incident led up to the matter that still rankled
      deeply in her soul. Her face was now paler and thinner than it had been;
      even more attractive, her disappointments having inscribed themselves as
      meek thoughtfulness on a look that was once a little frivolous. The two
      ladies had called to be allowed to use the window for observing the
      departure of the Hussars, who were leaving for barracks much nearer to
      London.
    </p>
    <p>
      The troopers turned the corner of Barrack Road into the top of High
      Street, headed by their band playing 'The girl I left behind me' (which
      was formerly always the tune for such times, though it is now nearly
      disused). They came and passed the oriel, where an officer or two, looking
      up and discovering Mrs. Maumbry, saluted her, whose eyes filled with tears
      as the notes of the band waned away. Before the little group had recovered
      from that sense of the romantic which such spectacles impart, Mr. Maumbry
      came along the pavement. He probably had bidden his former
      brethren-in-arms a farewell at the top of the street, for he walked from
      that direction in his rather shabby clerical clothes, and with a basket on
      his arm which seemed to hold some purchases he had been making for his
      poorer parishioners. Unlike the soldiers he went along quite unconscious
      of his appearance or of the scene around.
    </p>
    <p>
      The contrast was too much for Laura. With lips that now quivered, she
      asked the invalid what he thought of the change that had come to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was difficult to answer, and with a wilfulness that was too strong in
      her she repeated the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you think,' she added, 'that a woman's husband has a right to do such
      a thing, even if he does feel a certain call to it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Her listener sympathized too largely with both of them to be anything but
      unsatisfactory in his reply. Laura gazed longingly out of the window
      towards the thin dusty line of Hussars, now smalling towards the Mellstock
      Ridge. 'I,' she said, 'who should have been in their van on the way to
      London, am doomed to fester in a hole in Durnover Lane!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Many events had passed and many rumours had been current concerning her
      before the invalid saw her again after her leave-taking that day.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <p>
      Casterbridge had known many military and civil episodes; many happy times,
      and times less happy; and now came the time of her visitation. The scourge
      of cholera had been laid on the suffering country, and the low-lying
      purlieus of this ancient borough had more than their share of the
      infliction. Mixen Lane, in the Durnover quarter, and in Maumbry's parish,
      was where the blow fell most heavily. Yet there was a certain mercy in its
      choice of a date, for Maumbry was the man for such an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spread of the epidemic was so rapid that many left the town and took
      lodgings in the villages and farms. Mr. Maumbry's house was close to the
      most infected street, and he himself was occupied morn, noon, and night in
      endeavours to stamp out the plague and in alleviating the sufferings of
      the victims. So, as a matter of ordinary precaution, he decided to isolate
      his wife somewhere away from him for a while.
    </p>
    <p>
      She suggested a village by the sea, near Budmouth Regis, and lodgings were
      obtained for her at Creston, a spot divided from the Casterbridge valley
      by a high ridge that gave it quite another atmosphere, though it lay no
      more than six miles off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thither she went. While she was rusticating in this place of safety, and
      her husband was slaving in the slums, she struck up an acquaintance with a
      lieutenant in the &mdash;-st Foot, a Mr. Vannicock, who was stationed with
      his regiment at the Budmouth infantry barracks. As Laura frequently sat on
      the shelving beach, watching each thin wave slide up to her, and hearing,
      without heeding, its gnaw at the pebbles in its retreat, he often took a
      walk that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The acquaintance grew and ripened. Her situation, her history, her beauty,
      her age-a year or two above his own-all tended to make an impression on
      the young man's heart, and a reckless flirtation was soon in blithe
      progress upon that lonely shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was said by her detractors afterwards that she had chosen her lodging
      to be near this gentleman, but there is reason to believe that she had
      never seen him till her arrival there. Just now Casterbridge was so deeply
      occupied with its own sad affairs-a daily burying of the dead and
      destruction of contaminated clothes and bedding-that it had little
      inclination to promulgate such gossip as may have reached its ears on the
      pair. Nobody long considered Laura in the tragic cloud which overhung all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, on the Budmouth side of the hill the very mood of men was in
      contrast. The visitation there had been slight and much earlier, and
      normal occupations and pastimes had been resumed. Mr. Maumbry had arranged
      to see Laura twice a week in the open air, that she might run no risk from
      him; and, having heard nothing of the faint rumour, he met her as usual
      one dry and windy afternoon on the summit of the dividing hill, near where
      the high road from town to town crosses the old Ridge- way at right
      angles.
    </p>
    <p>
      He waved his hand, and smiled as she approached, shouting to her: 'We will
      keep this wall between us, dear.' (Walls formed the field-fences here.)
      'You mustn't be endangered. It won't be for long, with God's help!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will do as you tell me, Jack. But you are running too much risk
      yourself, aren't you? I get little news of you; but I fancy you are.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not more than others.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus somewhat formally they talked, an insulating wind beating the wall
      between them like a mill-weir.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But you wanted to ask me something?' he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. You know we are trying in Budmouth to raise some money for your
      sufferers; and the way we have thought of is by a dramatic performance.
      They want me to take a part.'
    </p>
    <p>
      His face saddened. 'I have known so much of that sort of thing, and all
      that accompanies it! I wish you had thought of some other way.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She said lightly that she was afraid it was all settled. 'You object to my
      taking a part, then? Of course-'
    </p>
    <p>
      He told her that he did not like to say he positively objected. He wished
      they had chosen an oratorio, or lecture, or anything more in keeping with
      the necessity it was to relieve.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But,' said she impatiently, 'people won't come to oratorios or lectures!
      They will crowd to comedies and farces.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I cannot dictate to Budmouth how it shall earn the money it is
      going to give us. Who is getting up this performance?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The boys of the &mdash;-st.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, yes; our old game!' replied Mr. Maumbry. 'The grief of Casterbridge
      is the excuse for their frivolity. Candidly, dear Laura, I wish you
      wouldn't play in it. But I don't forbid you to. I leave the whole to your
      judgment.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The interview ended, and they went their ways northward and southward.
      Time disclosed to all concerned that Mrs. Maumbry played in the comedy as
      the heroine, the lover's part being taken by Mr. Vannicock.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Thus was helped on an event which the conduct of the mutually-attracted
      ones had been generating for some time.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is unnecessary to give details. The &mdash;-st Foot left for Bristol,
      and this precipitated their action. After a week of hesitation she agreed
      to leave her home at Creston and meet Vannicock on the ridge hard by, and
      to accompany him to Bath, where he had secured lodgings for her, so that
      she would be only about a dozen miles from his quarters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, on the evening chosen, she laid on her dressing-table a note
      for her husband, running thus:-
    </p>
    <p>
      DEAR JACK-I am unable to endure this life any longer, and I have resolved
      to put an end to it. I told you I should run away if you persisted in
      being a clergyman, and now I am doing it. One cannot help one's nature. I
      have resolved to throw in my lot with Mr. Vannicock, and I hope rather
      than expect you will forgive me.-L.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, with hardly a scrap of luggage, she went, ascending to the ridge in
      the dusk of early evening. Almost on the very spot where her husband had
      stood at their last tryst she beheld the outline of Vannicock, who had
      come all the way from Bristol to fetch her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't like meeting here-it is so unlucky!' she cried to him. 'For God's
      sake let us have a place of our own. Go back to the milestone, and I'll
      come on.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He went back to the milestone that stands on the north slope of the ridge,
      where the old and new roads diverge, and she joined him there.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was taciturn and sorrowful when he asked her why she would not meet
      him on the top. At last she inquired how they were going to travel.
    </p>
    <p>
      He explained that he proposed to walk to Mellstock Hill, on the other side
      of Casterbridge, where a fly was waiting to take them by a cross- cut into
      the Ivell Road, and onward to that town. The Bristol railway was open to
      Ivell.
    </p>
    <p>
      This plan they followed, and walked briskly through the dull gloom till
      they neared Casterbridge, which place they avoided by turning to the right
      at the Roman Amphitheatre and bearing round to Durnover Cross. Thence the
      way was solitary and open across the moor to the hill whereon the Ivell
      fly awaited them.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have noticed for some time,' she said, 'a lurid glare over the Durnover
      end of the town. It seems to come from somewhere about Mixen Lane.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The lamps,' he suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      'There's not a lamp as big as a rushlight in the whole lane. It is where
      the cholera is worst.'
    </p>
    <p>
      By Standfast Corner, a little beyond the Cross, they suddenly obtained an
      end view of the lane. Large bonfires were burning in the middle of the
      way, with a view to purifying the air; and from the wretched tenements
      with which the lane was lined in those days persons were bringing out
      bedding and clothing. Some was thrown into the fires, the rest placed in
      wheel-barrows and wheeled into the moor directly in the track of the
      fugitives.
    </p>
    <p>
      They followed on, and came up to where a vast copper was set in the open
      air. Here the linen was boiled and disinfected. By the light of the
      lanterns Laura discovered that her husband was standing by the copper, and
      that it was he who unloaded the barrow and immersed its contents. The
      night was so calm and muggy that the conversation by the copper reached
      her ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Are there many more loads to-night?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'There's the clothes o' they that died this afternoon, sir. But that might
      bide till to-morrow, for you must be tired out.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'We'll do it at once, for I can't ask anybody else to undertake it.
      Overturn that load on the grass and fetch the rest.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The man did so and went off with the barrow. Maumbry paused for a moment
      to wipe his face, and resumed his homely drudgery amid this squalid and
      reeking scene, pressing down and stirring the contents of the copper with
      what looked like an old rolling-pin. The steam therefrom, laden with
      death, travelled in a low trail across the meadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura spoke suddenly: 'I won't go to-night after all. He is so tired, and
      I must help him. I didn't know things were so bad as this!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Vannicock's arm dropped from her waist, where it had been resting as they
      walked. 'Will you leave?' she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will if you say I must. But I'd rather help too.' There was no
      expostulation in his tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura had gone forward. 'Jack,' she said, 'I am come to help!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The weary curate turned and held up the lantern. 'O-what, is it you,
      Laura?' he asked in surprise. 'Why did you come into this? You had better
      go back-the risk is great.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But I want to help you, Jack. Please let me help! I didn't come by
      myself-Mr. Vannicock kept me company. He will make himself useful too, if
      he's not gone on. Mr. Vannicock!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The young lieutenant came forward reluctantly. Mr. Maumbry spoke formally
      to him, adding as he resumed his labour, 'I thought the &mdash;-st Foot
      had gone to Bristol.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'We have. But I have run down again for a few things.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The two newcomers began to assist, Vannicock placing on the ground the
      small bag containing Laura's toilet articles that he had been carrying.
      The barrowman soon returned with another load, and all continued work for
      nearly a half-hour, when a coachman came out from the shadows to the
      north.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Beg pardon, sir,' he whispered to Vannicock, 'but I've waited so long on
      Mellstock hill that at last I drove down to the turnpike; and seeing the
      light here, I ran on to find out what had happened.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lieutenant Vannicock told him to wait a few minutes, and the last
      barrow-load was got through. Mr. Maumbry stretched himself and breathed
      heavily, saying, 'There; we can do no more.'
    </p>
    <p>
      As if from the relaxation of effort he seemed to be seized with violent
      pain. He pressed his hands to his sides and bent forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah! I think it has got hold of me at last,' he said with difficulty. 'I
      must try to get home. Let Mr. Vannicock take you back, Laura.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked a few steps, they helping him, but was obliged to sink down on
      the grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am-afraid-you'll have to send for a hurdle, or shutter, or something,'
      he went on feebly, 'or try to get me into the barrow.'
    </p>
    <p>
      But Vannicock had called to the driver of the fly, and they waited until
      it was brought on from the turnpike hard by. Mr. Maumbry was placed
      therein. Laura entered with him, and they drove to his humble residence
      near the Cross, where he was got upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vannicock stood outside by the empty fly awhile, but Laura did not
      reappear. He thereupon entered the fly and told the driver to take him
      back to Ivell.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Maumbry had over-exerted himself in the relief of the suffering poor,
      and fell a victim-one of the last-to the pestilence which had carried off
      so many. Two days later he lay in his coffin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura was in the room below. A servant brought in some letters, and she
      glanced them over. One was the note from herself to Maumbry, informing him
      that she was unable to endure life with him any longer and was about to
      elope with Vannicock. Having read the letter she took it upstairs to where
      the dead man was, and slipped it into his coffin. The next day she buried
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was now free.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shut up his house at Durnover Cross and returned to her lodgings at
      Creston. Soon she had a letter from Vannicock, and six weeks after her
      husband's death her lover came to see her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I forgot to give you back this-that night,' he said presently, handing
      her the little bag she had taken as her whole luggage when leaving.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura received it and absently shook it out. There fell upon the carpet
      her brush, comb, slippers, nightdress, and other simple necessaries for a
      journey. They had an intolerably ghastly look now, and she tried to cover
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I can now,' he said, 'ask you to belong to me legally-when a proper
      interval has gone-instead of as we meant.'
    </p>
    <p>
      There was languor in his utterance, hinting at a possibility that it was
      perfunctorily made. Laura picked up her articles, answering that he
      certainly could so ask her-she was free. Yet not her expression either
      could be called an ardent response. Then she bCHANGElinked more and more
      quickly and put her handkerchief to her face. She was weeping violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not move or try to comfort her in any way. What had come between
      them? No living person. They had been lovers. There was now no material
      obstacle whatever to their union. But there was the insistent shadow of
      that unconscious one; the thin figure of him, moving to and fro in front
      of the ghastly furnace in the gloom of Durnover Moor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet Vannicock called upon Laura when he was in the neighbourhood, which
      was not often; but in two years, as if on purpose to further the marriage
      which everybody was expecting, the &mdash;-st Foot returned to Budmouth
      Regis.

    <p>
      Thereupon the two could not help encountering each other at times. But
      whether because the obstacle had been the source of the love, or from a
      sense of error, and because Mrs. Maumbry bore a less attractive look as a
      widow than before, their feelings seemed to decline from their former
      incandescence to a mere tepid civility. What domestic issues supervened in
      Vannicock's further story the man in the oriel never knew; but Mrs.
      Maumbry lived and died a widow.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <p>
      Whoever had perceived the yeoman standing on Squire Everard's lawn in the
      dusk of that October evening fifty years ago, might have said at first
      sight that he was loitering there from idle curiosity. For a large
      five-light window of the manor-house in front of him was unshuttered and
      uncurtained, so that the illuminated room within could be scanned almost
      to its four corners. Obviously nobody was ever expected to be in this part
      of the grounds after nightfall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The apartment thus swept by an eye from without was occupied by two
      persons; they were sitting over dessert, the tablecloth having been
      removed in the old-fashioned way. The fruits were local, consisting of
      apples, pears, nuts, and such other products of the summer as might be
      presumed to grow on the estate. There was strong ale and rum on the table,
      and but little wine. Moreover, the appointments of the dining- room were
      simple and homely even for the date, betokening a countrified household of
      the smaller gentry, without much wealth or ambition-formerly a numerous
      class, but now in great part ousted by the territorial landlords.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the two sitters was a young lady in white muslin, who listened
      somewhat impatiently to the remarks of her companion, an elderly, rubicund
      personage, whom the merest stranger could have pronounced to be her
      father. The watcher evinced no signs of moving, and it became evident that
      affairs were not so simple as they first had seemed. The tall farmer was
      in fact no accidental spectator, and he stood by premeditation close to
      the trunk of a tree, so that had any traveller passed along the road
      without the park gate, or even round the lawn to the door, that person
      would scarce have noticed the other, notwithstanding that the gate was
      quite near at hand, and the park little larger than a paddock. There was
      still light enough in the western heaven to brighten faintly one side of
      the man's face, and to show against the trunk of the tree behind the
      admirable cut of his profile; also to reveal that the front of the
      manor-house, small though it seemed, was solidly built of stone in that
      never-to-be-surpassed style for the English country residence-the
      mullioned and transomed Elizabethan.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lawn, although neglected, was still as level as a bowling- green-which
      indeed it might once have served for; and the blades of grass before the
      window were raked by the candle-shine, which stretched over them so far as
      to touch the yeoman's face in front.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within the dining-room there were also, with one of the twain, the same
      signs of a hidden purpose that marked the farmer. The young lady's mind
      was straying as clearly into the shadows as that of the loiterer was fixed
      upon the room-nay, it could be said that she was quite conscious of his
      presence outside. Impatience caused her foot to beat silently on the
      carpet, and she more than once rose to leave the table. This proceeding
      was checked by her father, who would put his hand upon her shoulder and
      unceremoniously press her down into her chair, till he should have
      concluded his observations. Her replies were brief enough, and there was
      factitiousness in her smiles of assent to his views. A small iron casement
      between two of the mullions was open, and some occasional words of the
      dialogue were audible without.
    </p>
    <p>
      'As for drains-how can I put in drains? The pipes don't cost much, that's
      true; but the labour in sinking the trenches is ruination. And then the
      gates-they should be hung to stone posts, otherwise there's no keeping
      them up through harvest.' The Squire's voice was strongly toned with the
      local accent, so that he said 'drains' and 'geats' like the rustics on his
      estate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The landscape without grew darker, and the young man's figure seemed to be
      absorbed into the trunk of the tree. The small stars filled in between the
      larger, the nebulae between the small stars, the trees quite lost their
      voice; and if there was still a sound, it was from the cascade of a stream
      which stretched along under the trees that bounded the lawn on its
      northern side.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the young girl did get to her feet and secure her retreat. 'I have
      something to do, papa,' she said. 'I shall not be in the drawing- room
      just yet.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very well,' replied he. 'Then I won't hurry.' And closing the door behind
      her, he drew his decanters together and settled down in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three minutes after that a woman's shape emerged from the drawing-room
      window, and passing through a wall-door to the entrance front, came across
      the grass. She kept well clear of the dining-room window, but enough of
      its light fell on her to show, escaping from the dark-hooded cloak that
      she wore, stray verges of the same light dress which had figured but
      recently at the dinner-table. The hood was contracted tight about her face
      with a drawing-string, making her countenance small and baby-like, and
      lovelier even than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without hesitation she brushed across the grass to the tree under which
      the young man stood concealed. The moment she had reached him he enclosed
      her form with his arm. The meeting and embrace, though by no means formal,
      were yet not passionate; the whole proceeding was that of persons who had
      repeated the act so often as to be unconscious of its performance. She
      turned within his arm, and faced in the same direction with himself, which
      was towards the window; and thus they stood without speaking, the back of
      her head leaning against his shoulder. For a while each seemed to be
      thinking his and her diverse thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You have kept me waiting a long time, dear Christine,' he said at last.
      'I wanted to speak to you particularly, or I should not have stayed. How
      came you to be dining at this time o' night?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Father has been out all day, and dinner was put back till six. I know I
      have kept you; but Nicholas, how can I help it sometimes, if I am not to
      run any risk? My poor father insists upon my listening to all he has to
      say; since my brother left he has had nobody else to listen to him; and
      to-night he was particularly tedious on his usual topics-draining, and
      tenant-farmers, and the village people. I must take daddy to London; he
      gets so narrow always staying here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And what did you say to it all?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I took the part of the tenant-farmers, of course, as the beloved of
      one should in duty do.' There followed a little break or gasp, implying a
      strangled sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are sorry you have encouraged that beloving one?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no, Nicholas . . . What is it you want to see me for particularly?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I know you are sorry, as time goes on, and everything is at a dead- lock,
      with no prospect of change, and your rural swain loses his freshness! Only
      think, this secret understanding between us has lasted near three year,
      ever since you was a little over sixteen.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes; it has been a long time.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And I an untamed, uncultivated man, who has never seen London, and knows
      nothing about society at all.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not uncultivated, dear Nicholas. Untravelled, socially unpractised, if
      you will,' she said, smiling. 'Well, I did sigh; but not because I regret
      being your promised one. What I do sometimes regret is that the scheme,
      which my meetings with you are but a part of, has not been carried out
      completely. You said, Nicholas, that if I consented to swear to keep faith
      with you, you would go away and travel, and see nations, and peoples, and
      cities, and take a professor with you, and study books and art,
      simultaneously with your study of men and manners; and then come back at
      the end of two years, when I should find that my father would by no means
      be indisposed to accept you as a son-in-law. You said your reason for
      wishing to get my promise before starting was that your mind would then be
      more at rest when you were far away, and so could give itself more
      completely to knowledge than if you went as my unaccepted lover only,
      fuming with anxiety as to how I should be when you came back. I saw how
      reasonable that was; and solemnly swore myself to you in consequence. But
      instead of going to see the world you stay on and on here to see me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And you don't want me to see you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes-no-it is not that. It is that I have latterly felt frightened at what
      I am doing when not in your actual presence. It seems so wicked not to
      tell my father that I have a lover close at hand, within touch and view of
      both of us; whereas if you were absent my conduct would not seem quite so
      treacherous. The realities would not stare at one so. You would be a
      pleasant dream to me, which I should be free to indulge in without
      reproach of my conscience; I should live in hopeful expectation of your
      returning fully qualified to boldly claim me of my father. There, I have
      been terribly frank, I know.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He in his turn had lapsed into gloomy breathings now. 'I did plan it as
      you state,' he answered. 'I did mean to go away the moment I had your
      promise. But, dear Christine, I did not foresee two or three things. I did
      not know what a lot of pain it would cost to tear myself from you. And I
      did not know that my stingy uncle-heaven forgive me calling him so!-would
      so flatly refuse to advance me money for my purpose-the scheme of
      travelling with a first-rate tutor costing a formidable sum o' money. You
      have no idea what it would cost!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But I have said that I'll find the money.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, there,' he returned, 'you have hit a sore place. To speak truly,
      dear, I would rather stay unpolished a hundred years than take your
      money.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But why? Men continually use the money of the women they marry.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes; but not till afterwards. No man would like to touch your money at
      present, and I should feel very mean if I were to do so in present
      circumstances. That brings me to what I was going to propose. But no-upon
      the whole I will not propose it now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah! I would guarantee expenses, and you won't let me! The money is my
      personal possession: it comes to me from my late grandfather, and not from
      my father at all.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed forcedly and pressed her hand. 'There are more reasons why I
      cannot tear myself away,' he added. 'What would become of my uncle's
      farming? Six hundred acres in this parish, and five hundred in the next-a
      constant traipsing from one farm to the other; he can't be in two places
      at once. Still, that might be got over if it were not for the other
      matters. Besides, dear, I still should be a little uneasy, even though I
      have your promise, lest somebody should snap you up away from me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, you should have thought of that before. Otherwise I have committed
      myself for nothing.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I should have thought of it,' he answered gravely. 'But I did not. There
      lies my fault, I admit it freely. Ah, if you would only commit yourself a
      little more, I might at least get over that difficulty! But I won't ask
      you. You have no idea how much you are to me still; you could not argue so
      coolly if you had. What property belongs to you I hate the very sound of;
      it is you I care for. I wish you hadn't a farthing in the world but what I
      could earn for you!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't altogether wish that,' she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I wish it, because it would have made what I was going to propose much
      easier to do than it is now. Indeed I will not propose it, although I came
      on purpose, after what you have said in your frankness.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nonsense, Nic. Come, tell me. How can you be so touchy?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Look at this then, Christine dear.' He drew from his breast-pocket a
      sheet of paper and unfolded it, when it was observable that a seal dangled
      from the bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What is it?' She held the paper sideways, so that what there was of
      window-light fell on its surface. 'I can only read the Old English
      letters-why-our names! Surely it is not a marriage-licence?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She trembled. 'O Nic! how could you do this-and without telling me!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why should I have thought I must tell you? You had not spoken "frankly"
      then as you have now. We have been all to each other more than these two
      years, and I thought I would propose that we marry privately, and that I
      then leave you on the instant. I would have taken my travelling-bag to
      church, and you would have gone home alone. I should not have started on
      my adventures in the brilliant manner of our original plan, but should
      have roughed it a little at first; my great gain would have been that the
      absolute possession of you would have enabled me to work with spirit and
      purpose, such as nothing else could do. But I dare not ask you now-so
      frank as you have been.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer. The document he had produced gave such unexpected
      substantiality to the venture with which she had so long toyed as a vague
      dream merely, that she was, in truth, frightened a little. 'I-don't know
      about it!' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Perhaps not. Ah, my little lady, you are wearying of me!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, Nic,' responded she, creeping closer. 'I am not. Upon my word, and
      truth, and honour, I am not, Nic.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A mere tiller of the soil, as I should be called,' he continued, without
      heeding her. 'And you-well, a daughter of one of the-I won't say oldest
      families, because that's absurd, all families are the same age-one of the
      longest chronicled families about here, whose name is actually the name of
      the place.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's not much, I am sorry to say! My poor brother-but I won't speak of
      that . . . Well,' she murmured mischievously, after a pause, 'you
      certainly would not need to be uneasy if I were to do this that you want
      me to do. You would have me safe enough in your trap then; I couldn't get
      away!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's just it!' he said vehemently. 'It is a trap-you feel it so, and
      that though you wouldn't be able to get away from me you might
      particularly wish to! Ah, if I had asked you two years ago you would have
      agreed instantly. But I thought I was bound to wait for the proposal to
      come from you as the superior!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now you are angry, and take seriously what I meant purely in fun. You
      don't know me even yet! To show you that you have not been mistaken in me,
      I do propose to carry out this licence. I'll marry you, dear Nicholas,
      to-morrow morning.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, Christine! I am afraid I have stung you on to this, so that I
      cannot-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, no, no!' she hastily rejoined; and there was something in her tone
      which suggested that she had been put upon her mettle and would not
      flinch. 'Take me whilst I am in the humour. What church is the licence
      for?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That I've not looked to see-why our parish church here, of course. Ah,
      then we cannot use it! We dare not be married here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'We do dare,' said she. 'And we will too, if you'll be there.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If I'll be there!'
    </p>
    <p>
      They speedily came to an agreement that he should be in the church-porch
      at ten minutes to eight on the following morning, awaiting her; and that,
      immediately after the conclusion of the service which would make them one,
      Nicholas should set out on his long-deferred educational tour, towards the
      cost of which she was resolving to bring a substantial subscription with
      her to church. Then, slipping from him, she went indoors by the way she
      had come, and Nicholas bent his steps homewards.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <p>
      Instead of leaving the spot by the gate, he flung himself over the fence,
      and pursued a direction towards the river under the trees. And it was now,
      in his lonely progress, that he showed for the first time outwardly that
      he was not altogether unworthy of her. He wore long water-boots reaching
      above his knees, and, instead of making a circuit to find a bridge by
      which he might cross the Froom-the river aforesaid-he made straight for
      the point whence proceeded the low roar that was at this hour the only
      evidence of the stream's existence. He speedily stood on the verge of the
      waterfall which caused the noise, and stepping into the water at the top
      of the fall, waded through with the sure tread of one who knew every inch
      of his footing, even though the canopy of trees rendered the darkness
      almost absolute, and a false step would have precipitated him into the
      pool beneath. Soon reaching the boundary of the grounds, he continued in
      the same direct line to traverse the alluvial valley, full of brooks and
      tributaries to the main stream-in former times quite impassable, and
      impassable in winter now. Sometimes he would cross a deep gully on a plank
      not wider than the hand; at another time he ploughed his way through beds
      of spear-grass, where at a few feet to the right or left he might have
      been sucked down into a morass. At last he reached firm land on the other
      side of this watery tract, and came to his house on the rise
      behind-Elsenford-an ordinary farmstead, from the back of which rose
      indistinct breathings, belchings, and snortings, the rattle of halters,
      and other familiar features of an agriculturist's home.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Nicholas Long was packing his bag in an upper room of this dwelling,
      Miss Christine Everard sat at a desk in her own chamber at Froom-Everard
      manor-house, looking with pale fixed countenance at the candles.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I ought-I must now!' she whispered to herself. 'I should not have begun
      it if I had not meant to carry it through! It runs in the blood of us, I
      suppose.' She alluded to a fact unknown to her lover, the clandestine
      marriage of an aunt under circumstances somewhat similar to the present.
      In a few minutes she had penned the following note:-
    </p>
    <p>
      October 13, 183-.
    </p>
    <p>
      DEAR MR. BEALAND-Can you make it convenient to yourself to meet me at the
      Church to-morrow morning at eight? I name the early hour because it would
      suit me better than later on in the day. You will find me in the chancel,
      if you can come. An answer yes or no by the bearer of this will be
      sufficient.
    </p>
    <h3>
      CHRISTINE EVERARD.
    </h3>
    <p>
      She sent the note to the rector immediately, waiting at a small side- door
      of the house till she heard the servant's footsteps returning along the
      lane, when she went round and met him in the passage. The rector had taken
      the trouble to write a line, and answered that he would meet her with
      pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dripping fog which ushered in the next morning was highly favourable to
      the scheme of the pair. At that time of the century Froom-Everard House
      had not been altered and enlarged; the public lane passed close under its
      walls; and there was a door opening directly from one of the old
      parlours-the south parlour, as it was called-into the lane which led to
      the village. Christine came out this way, and after following the lane for
      a short distance entered upon a path within a belt of plantation, by which
      the church could be reached privately. She even avoided the churchyard
      gate, walking along to a place where the turf without the low wall rose
      into a mound, enabling her to mount upon the coping and spring down
      inside. She crossed the wet graves, and so glided round to the door. He
      was there, with his bag in his hand. He kissed her with a sort of
      surprise, as if he had expected that at the last moment her heart would
      fail her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though it had not failed her, there was, nevertheless, no great ardour in
      Christine's bearing-merely the momentum of an antecedent impulse. They
      went up the aisle together, the bottle-green glass of the old lead
      quarries admitting but little light at that hour, and under such an
      atmosphere. They stood by the altar-rail in silence, Christine's skirt
      visibly quivering at each beat of her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently a quick step ground upon the gravel, and Mr. Bealand came round
      by the front. He was a quiet bachelor, courteous towards Christine, and
      not at first recognizing in Nicholas a neighbouring yeoman (for he lived
      aloofly in the next parish), advanced to her without revealing any
      surprise at her unusual request. But in truth he was surprised, the keen
      interest taken by many country young women at the present day in church
      decoration and festivals being then unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good morning,' he said; and repeated the same words to Nicholas more
      mechanically.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good morning,' she replied gravely. 'Mr. Bealand, I have a serious reason
      for asking you to meet me-us, I may say. We wish you to marry us.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The rector's gaze hardened to fixity, rather between than upon either of
      them, and he neither moved nor replied for some time.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah!' he said at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And we are quite ready.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I had no idea-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It has been kept rather private,' she said calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Where are your witnesses?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'They are outside in the meadow, sir. I can call them in a moment,' said
      Nicholas.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh-I see it is-Mr. Nicholas Long,' said Mr. Bealand, and turning again to
      Christine, 'Does your father know of this?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is it necessary that I should answer that question, Mr. Bealand?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am afraid it is-highly necessary.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Christine began to look concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Where is the licence?' the rector asked; 'since there have been no
      banns.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Nicholas produced it, Mr. Bealand read it, an operation which occupied him
      several minutes-or at least he made it appear so; till Christine said
      impatiently, 'We are quite ready, Mr. Bealand. Will you proceed? Mr. Long
      has to take a journey of a great many miles to-day.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No. I remain.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bealand assumed firmness. 'There is something wrong in this,' he said.
      'I cannot marry you without your father's presence.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But have you a right to refuse us?' interposed Nicholas. 'I believe we
      are in a position to demand your fulfilment of our request.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, you are not! Is Miss Everard of age? I think not. I think she is
      months from being so. Eh, Miss Everard?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Am I bound to tell that?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Certainly. At any rate you are bound to write it. Meanwhile I refuse to
      solemnize the service. And let me entreat you two young people to do
      nothing so rash as this, even if by going to some strange church, you may
      do so without discovery. The tragedy of marriage-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Tragedy?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Certainly. It is full of crises and catastrophes, and ends with the death
      of one of the actors. The tragedy of marriage, as I was saying, is one I
      shall not be a party to your beginning with such light hearts, and I shall
      feel bound to put your father on his guard, Miss Everard. Think better of
      it, I entreat you! Remember the proverb, "Marry in haste and repent at
      leisure."'
    </p>
    <p>
      Christine, spurred by opposition, almost stormed at him. Nicholas
      implored; but nothing would turn that obstinate rector. She sat down and
      reflected. By-and-by she confronted Mr. Bealand.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Our marriage is not to be this morning, I see,' she said. 'Now grant me
      one favour, and in return I'll promise you to do nothing rashly. Do not
      tell my father a word of what has happened here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I agree-if you undertake not to elope.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at Nicholas, and he looked at her. 'Do you wish me to elope,
      Nic?' she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No,' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the compact was made, and they left the church singly, Nicholas
      remaining till the last, and closing the door. On his way home, carrying
      the well-packed bag which was just now to go no further, the two men who
      were mending water-carriers in the meadows approached the hedge, as if
      they had been on the alert all the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You said you mid want us for zummat, sir?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'All right-never mind,' he answered through the hedge. 'I did not require
      you after all.'

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <p>
      At a manor not far away there lived a queer and primitive couple who had
      lately been blessed with a son and heir. The christening took place during
      the week under notice, and this had been followed by a feast to the
      parishioners. Christine's father, one of the same generation and kind, had
      been asked to drive over and assist in the entertainment, and Christine,
      as a matter of course, accompanied him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they reached Athelhall, as the house was called, they found the
      usually quiet nook a lively spectacle. Tables had been spread in the
      apartment which lent its name to the whole building-the hall
      proper-covered with a fine open-timbered roof, whose braces, purlins, and
      rafters made a brown thicket of oak overhead. Here tenantry of all ages
      sat with their wives and families, and the servants were assisted in their
      ministrations by the sons and daughters of the owner's friends and
      neighbours. Christine lent a hand among the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was holding a plate in each hand towards a huge brown platter of baked
      rice-pudding, from which a footman was scooping a large spoonful, when a
      voice reached her ear over her shoulder: 'Allow me to hold them for you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Christine turned, and recognized in the speaker the nephew of the
      entertainer, a young man from London, whom she had already met on two or
      three occasions.
    </p>
    <p>
      She accepted the proffered help, and from that moment, whenever he passed
      her in their marchings to and fro during the remainder of the serving, he
      smiled acquaintance. When their work was done, he improved the few words
      into a conversation. He plainly had been attracted by her fairness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bellston was a self-assured young man, not particularly good-looking, with
      more colour in his skin than even Nicholas had. He had flushed a little in
      attracting her notice, though the flush had nothing of nervousness in
      it-the air with which it was accompanied making it curiously suggestive of
      a flush of anger; and even when he laughed it was difficult to banish that
      fancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The late autumn sunlight streamed in through the window panes upon the
      heads and shoulders of the venerable patriarchs of the hamlet, and upon
      the middle-aged, and upon the young; upon men and women who had played
      out, or were to play, tragedies or tragi-comedies in that nook of
      civilization not less great, essentially, than those which, enacted on
      more central arenas, fix the attention of the world. One of the party was
      a cousin of Nicholas Long's, who sat with her husband and children.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make himself as locally harmonious as possible, Mr. Bellston remarked
      to his companion on the scene-'It does one's heart good,' he said, 'to see
      these simple peasants enjoying themselves.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O Mr. Bellston!' exclaimed Christine; 'don't be too sure about that word
      "simple"! You little think what they see and meditate! Their reasonings
      and emotions are as complicated as ours.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke with a vehemence which would have been hardly present in her
      words but for her own relation to Nicholas. The sense of that produced in
      her a nameless depression thenceforward. The young man, however, still
      followed her up.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am glad to hear you say it,' he returned warmly. 'I was merely attuning
      myself to your mood, as I thought. The real truth is that I know more of
      the Parthians, and Medes, and dwellers in Mesopotamia-almost of any
      people, indeed-than of the English rustics. Travel and exploration are my
      profession, not the study of the British peasantry.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Travel. There was sufficient coincidence between his declaration and the
      course she had urged upon her lover, to lend Bellston's account of himself
      a certain interest in Christine's ears. He might perhaps be able to tell
      her something that would be useful to Nicholas, if their dream were
      carried out. A door opened from the hall into the garden, and she somehow
      found herself outside, chatting with Mr. Bellston on this topic, till she
      thought that upon the whole she liked the young man. The garden being his
      uncle's, he took her round it with an air of proprietorship; and they went
      on amongst the Michaelmas daisies and chrysanthemums, and through a door
      to the fruit-garden. A green-house was open, and he went in and cut her a
      bunch of grapes.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How daring of you! They are your uncle's.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, he don't mind-I do anything here. A rough old buffer, isn't he?'
    </p>
    <p>
      She was thinking of her Nic, and felt that, by comparison with her present
      acquaintance, the farmer more than held his own as a fine and intelligent
      fellow; but the harmony with her own existence in little things, which she
      found here, imparted an alien tinge to Nicholas just now. The latter,
      idealized by moonlight, or a thousand miles of distance, was altogether a
      more romantic object for a woman's dream than this smart new-lacquered
      man; but in the sun of afternoon, and amid a surrounding company, Mr.
      Bellston was a very tolerable companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they re-entered the hall, Bellston entreated her to come with him up
      a spiral stair in the thickness of the wall, leading to a passage and
      gallery whence they could look down upon the scene below. The people had
      finished their feast, the newly-christened baby had been exhibited, and a
      few words having been spoken to them they began, amid a racketing of
      forms, to make for the greensward without, Nicholas's cousin and cousin's
      wife and cousin's children among the rest. While they were filing out, a
      voice was heard calling-'Hullo!-here, Jim; where are you?' said Bellston's
      uncle. The young man descended, Christine following at leisure.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now will ye be a good fellow,' the Squire continued, 'and set them going
      outside in some dance or other that they know? I'm dog-tired, and I want
      to have a yew words with Mr. Everard before we join 'em-hey, Everard? They
      are shy till somebody starts 'em; afterwards they'll keep gwine brisk
      enough.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ay, that they wool,' said Squire Everard.
    </p>
    <p>
      They followed to the lawn; and here it proved that James Bellston was as
      shy, or rather as averse, as any of the tenantry themselves, to acting the
      part of fugleman. Only the parish people had been at the feast, but
      outlying neighbours had now strolled in for a dance.
    </p>
    <p>
      'They want "Speed the Plough,"' said Bellston, coming up breathless. 'It
      must be a country dance, I suppose? Now, Miss Everard, do have pity upon
      me. I am supposed to lead off; but really I know no more about speeding
      the plough than a child just born! Would you take one of the
      villagers?-just to start them, my uncle says. Suppose you take that
      handsome young farmer over there-I don't know his name, but I dare say you
      do-and I'll come on with one of the dairyman's daughters as a second
      couple.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Christine turned in the direction signified, and changed colour-though in
      the shade nobody noticed it, 'Oh, yes-I know him,' she said coolly. 'He is
      from near our own place-Mr. Nicholas Long.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's capital-then you can easily make him stand as first couple with
      you. Now I must pick up mine.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I-I think I'll dance with you, Mr. Bellston,' she said with some
      trepidation. 'Because, you see,' she explained eagerly, 'I know the figure
      and you don't-so that I can help you; while Nicholas Long, I know, is
      familiar with the figure, and that will make two couples who know it-which
      is necessary, at least.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Bellston showed his gratification by one of his angry-pleasant flushes-he
      had hardly dared to ask for what she proffered freely; and having
      requested Nicholas to take the dairyman's daughter, led Christine to her
      place, Long promptly stepping up second with his charge. There were grim
      silent depths in Nic's character; a small deedy spark in his eye, as it
      caught Christine's, was all that showed his consciousness of her. Then the
      fiddlers began-the celebrated Mellstock fiddlers who, given free
      stripping, could play from sunset to dawn without turning a hair. The
      couples wheeled and swung, Nicholas taking Christine's hand in the course
      of business with the figure, when she waited for him to give it a little
      squeeze; but he did not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christine had the greatest difficulty in steering her partner through the
      maze, on account of his self-will, and when at last they reached the
      bottom of the long line, she was breathless with her hard labour.. Resting
      here, she watched Nic and his lady; and, though she had decidedly cooled
      off in these later months, began to admire him anew. Nobody knew these
      dances like him, after all, or could do anything of this sort so well. His
      performance with the dairyman's daughter so won upon her, that when 'Speed
      the Plough' was over she contrived to speak to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nic, you are to dance with me next time.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He said he would, and presently asked her in a formal public manner,
      lifting his hat gallantly. She showed a little backwardness, which he
      quite understood, and allowed him to lead her to the top, a row of
      enormous length appearing below them as if by magic as soon as they had
      taken their places. Truly the Squire was right when he said that they only
      wanted starting.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What is it to be?' whispered Nicholas.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned to the band. 'The Honeymoon,' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then they trod the delightful last-century measure of that name, which
      if it had been ever danced better, was never danced with more zest. The
      perfect responsiveness which their tender acquaintance threw into the
      motions of Nicholas and his partner lent to their gyrations the fine
      adjustment of two interacting parts of a single machine. The excitement of
      the movement carried Christine back to the time-the unreflecting
      passionate time, about two years before-when she and Nic had been
      incipient lovers only; and it made her forget the carking anxieties, the
      vision of social breakers ahead, that had begun to take the gilding off
      her position now. Nicholas, on his part, had never ceased to be a lover;
      no personal worries had as yet made him conscious of any staleness,
      flatness, or unprofitableness in his admiration of Christine.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not quite so wildly, Nic,' she whispered. 'I don't object personally; but
      they'll notice us. How came you here?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I heard that you had driven over; and I set out-on purpose for this.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What-you have walked?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. If I had waited for one of uncle's horses I should have been too
      late.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Five miles here and five back-ten miles on foot-merely to dance!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'With you. What made you think of this old "Honeymoon" thing?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O! it came into my head when I saw you, as what would have been a reality
      with us if you had not been stupid about that licence, and had got it for
      a distant church.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Shall we try again?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No-I don't know. I'll think it over.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The villagers admired their grace and skill, as the dancers themselves
      perceived; but they did not know what accompanied that admiration in one
      spot, at least.
    </p>
    <p>
      'People who wonder they can foot it so featly together should know what
      some others think,' a waterman was saying to his neighbour. 'Then their
      wonder would be less.'
    </p>
    <p>
      His comrade asked for information.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well-really I hardly believe it-but 'tis said they be man and wife. Yes,
      sure-went to church and did the job a'most afore 'twas light one morning.
      But mind, not a word of this; for 'twould be the loss of a winter's work
      to me if I had spread such a report and it were not true.'
    </p>
    <p>
      When the dance had ended she rejoined her own section of the company. Her
      father and Mr. Bellston the elder had now come out from the house, and
      were smoking in the background. Presently she found that her father was at
      her elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Christine, don't dance too often with young Long-as a mere matter of
      prudence, I mean, as volk might think it odd, he being one of our own
      neighbouring farmers. I should not mention this to 'ee if he were an
      ordinary young fellow; but being superior to the rest it behoves you to be
      careful.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Exactly, papa,' said Christine.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the revived sense that she was deceiving him threw a damp over her
      spirits. 'But, after all,' she said to herself, 'he is a young man of
      Elsenford, handsome, able, and the soul of honour; and I am a young woman
      of the adjoining parish, who have been constantly thrown into
      communication with him. Is it not, by nature's rule, the most proper thing
      in the world that I should marry him, and is it not an absurd conventional
      regulation which says that such a union would be wrong?'
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be concluded that the strength of Christine's large-minded argument
      was rather an evidence of weakness than of strength in the passion it
      concerned, which had required neither argument nor reasoning of any kind
      for its maintenance when full and flush in its early days.
    </p>
    <p>
      When driving home in the dark with her father she sank into pensive
      silence. She was thinking of Nicholas having to trudge on foot all those
      miles back after his exertions on the sward. Mr. Everard, arousing himself
      from a nap, said suddenly, 'I have something to mention to 'ee, by
      George-so I have, Chris! You probably know what it is?'
    </p>
    <p>
      She expressed ignorance, wondering if her father had discovered anything
      of her secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, according to him you know it. But I will tell 'ee. Perhaps you
      noticed young Jim Bellston walking me off down the lawn with him?-whether
      or no, we walked together a good while; and he informed me that he wanted
      to pay his addresses to 'ee. I naturally said that it depended upon
      yourself; and he replied that you were willing enough; you had given him
      particular encouragement-showing your preference for him by specially
      choosing him for your partner-hey? "In that case," says I, "go on and
      conquer-settle it with her-I have no objection." The poor fellow was very
      grateful, and in short, there we left the matter. He'll propose
      to-morrow.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw now to her dismay what James Bellston had read as encouragement.
      'He has mistaken me altogether,' she said. 'I had no idea of such a
      thing.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What, you won't have him?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Indeed, I cannot!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Chrissy,' said Mr. Everard with emphasis, 'there's noobody whom I should
      so like you to marry as that young man. He's a thoroughly clever fellow,
      and fairly well provided for. He's travelled all over the temperate zone;
      but he says that directly he marries he's going to give up all that, and
      be a regular stay-at-home. You would be nowhere safer than in his hands.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is true,' she answered. 'He is a highly desirable match, and I should
      be well provided for, and probably very safe in his hands.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then don't be skittish, and stand-to.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She had spoken from her conscience and understanding, and not to please
      her father. As a reflecting woman she believed that such a marriage would
      be a wise one. In great things Nicholas was closest to her nature; in
      little things Bellston seemed immeasurably nearer than Nic; and life was
      made up of little things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Altogether the firmament looked black for Nicholas Long, notwithstanding
      her half-hour's ardour for him when she saw him dancing with the
      dairyman's daughter. Most great passions, movements, and
      beliefs-individual and national-burst during their decline into a
      temporary irradiation, which rivals their original splendour; and then
      they speedily become extinct. Perhaps the dance had given the last
      flare-up to Christine's love. It seemed to have improvidently consumed for
      its immediate purpose all her ardour forwards, so that for the future
      there was nothing left but frigidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nicholas had certainly been very foolish about that licence!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      This laxity of emotional tone was further increased by an incident, when,
      two days later, she kept an appointment with Nicholas in the Sallows. The
      Sallows was an extension of shrubberies and plantations along the banks of
      the Froom, accessible from the lawn of Froom-Everard House only, except by
      wading through the river at the waterfall or elsewhere. Near the brink was
      a thicket of box in which a trunk lay prostrate; this had been once or
      twice their trysting-place, though it was by no means a safe one; and it
      was here she sat awaiting him now.
    </p>
    <p>
      The noise of the stream muffled any sound of footsteps, and it was before
      she was aware of his approach that she looked up and saw him wading across
      at the top of the waterfall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Noontide lights and dwarfed shadows always banished the romantic aspect of
      her love for Nicholas. Moreover, something new had occurred to disturb
      her; and if ever she had regretted giving way to a tenderness for
      him-which perhaps she had not done with any distinctness-she regretted it
      now. Yet in the bottom of their hearts those two were excellently paired,
      the very twin halves of a perfect whole; and their love was pure. But at
      this hour surfaces showed garishly, and obscured the depths. Probably her
      regret appeared in her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked up to her without speaking, the water running from his boots;
      and, taking one of her hands in each of his own, looked narrowly into her
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Have you thought it over?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Whether we shall try again; you remember saying you would at the dance?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, I had forgotten that!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are sorry we tried at all!' he said accusingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am not so sorry for the fact as for the rumours,' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah! rumours?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'They say we are already married.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I cannot tell exactly. I heard some whispering to that effect. Somebody
      in the village told one of the servants, I believe. This man said that he
      was crossing the churchyard early on that unfortunate foggy morning, and
      heard voices in the chancel, and peeped through the window as well as the
      dim panes would let him; and there he saw you and me and Mr. Bealand, and
      so on; but thinking his surmises would be dangerous knowledge, he hastened
      on. And so the story got afloat. Then your aunt, too-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good Lord!-what has she done?'
    </p>
    <p>
      The story was, told her, and she said proudly, "O yes, it is true enough.
      I have seen the licence. But it is not to be known yet."'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Seen the licence? How the-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Accidentally, I believe, when your coat was hanging somewhere.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The information, coupled with the infelicitous word 'proudly,' caused
      Nicholas to flush with mortification. He knew that it was in his aunt's
      nature to make a brag of that sort; but worse than the brag was the fact
      that this was the first occasion on which Christine had deigned to show
      her consciousness that such a marriage would be a source of pride to his
      relatives-the only two he had in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are sorry, then, even to be thought my wife, much less to be it.' He
      dropped her hand, which fell lifelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is not sorry exactly, dear Nic. But I feel uncomfortable and vexed,
      that after screwing up my courage, my fidelity, to the point of going to
      church, you should have so muddled-managed the matter that it has ended in
      neither one thing nor the other. How can I meet acquaintances, when I
      don't know what they are thinking of me?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then, dear Christine, let us mend the muddle. I'll go away for a few days
      and get another licence, and you can come to me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She shrank from this perceptibly. 'I cannot screw myself up to it a second
      time,' she said. 'I am sure I cannot! Besides, I promised Mr. Bealand. And
      yet how can I continue to see you after such a rumour? We shall be watched
      now, for certain.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then don't see me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I fear I must not for the present. Altogether-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am very depressed.'
    </p>
    <p>
      These views were not very inspiriting to Nicholas, as he construed them.
      It may indeed have been possible that he construed them wrongly, and
      should have insisted upon her making the rumour true. Unfortunately, too,
      he had come to her in a hurry through brambles and briars, water and weed,
      and the shaggy wildness which hung about his appearance at this fine and
      correct time of day lent an impracticability to the look of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You blame me-you repent your courses-you repent that you ever, ever owned
      anything to me!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, Nicholas, I do not repent that,' she returned gently, though with
      firmness. 'But I think that you ought not to have got that licence without
      asking me first; and I also think that you ought to have known how it
      would be if you lived on here in your present position, and made no effort
      to better it. I can bear whatever comes, for social ruin is not personal
      ruin or even personal disgrace. But as a sensible, new- risen poet says,
      whom I have been reading this morning:-
    </p>
    <p>
      The world and its ways have a certain worth: And to press a point while
      these oppose Were simple policy. Better wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as you had got my promise, Nic, you should have gone away-yes-and
      made a name, and come back to claim me. That was my silly girlish dream
      about my hero.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Perhaps I can do as much yet! And would you have indeed liked better to
      live away from me for family reasons, than to run a risk in seeing me for
      affection's sake? O what a cold heart it has grown! If I had been a
      prince, and you a dairymaid, I'd have stood by you in the face of the
      world!'
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head. 'Ah-you don't know what society is-you don't know.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Perhaps not. Who was that strange gentleman of about seven-and-twenty I
      saw at Mr. Bellston's christening feast?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh-that was his nephew James. Now he is a man who has seen an unusual
      extent of the world for his age. He is a great traveller, you know.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Indeed.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'In fact an explorer. He is very entertaining.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No doubt.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Nicholas received no shock of jealousy from her announcement. He knew her
      so well that he could see she was not in the least in love with Bellston.
      But he asked if Bellston were going to continue his explorations.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not if he settles in life. Otherwise he will, I suppose.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Perhaps I could be a great explorer, too, if I tried.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You could, I am sure.'
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat apart, and not together; each looking afar off at vague objects,
      and not in each other's eyes. Thus the sad autumn afternoon waned, while
      the waterfall hissed sarcastically of the inevitableness of the
      unpleasant. Very different this from the time when they had first met
      there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nook was most picturesque; but it looked horridly common and stupid
      now. Their sentiment had set a colour hardly less visible than a material
      one on surrounding objects, as sentiment must where life is but thought.
      Nicholas was as devoted as ever to the fair Christine; but unhappily he
      too had moods and humours, and the division between them was not closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had no sooner got indoors and sat down to her work-table than her
      father entered the drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      She handed him his newspaper; he took it without a word, went and stood on
      the hearthrug, and flung the paper on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Christine, what's the meaning of this terrible story? I was just on my
      way to look at the register.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him without speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You have married-Nicholas Long?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, father.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No? Can you say no in the face of such facts as I have been put in
      possession of?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But-the note you wrote to the rector-and the going to church?'
    </p>
    <p>
      She briefly explained that their attempt had failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah! Then this is what that dancing meant, was it? By &mdash;-, it makes
      me &mdash;-. How long has this been going on, may I ask?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'This what?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What, indeed! Why, making him your beau. Now listen to me. All's well
      that ends well; from this day, madam, this moment, he is to be nothing
      more to you. You are not to see him. Cut him adrift instantly! I only wish
      his volk were on my farm-out they should go, or I would know the reason
      why. However, you are to write him a letter to this effect at once.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How can I cut him adrift?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why not? You must, my good maid!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, though I have not actually married him, I have solemnly sworn to be
      his wife when he comes home from abroad to claim me. It would be gross
      perjury not to fulfil my promise. Besides, no woman can go to church with
      a man to deliberately solemnize matrimony, and refuse him afterwards, if
      he does nothing wrong meanwhile.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The uttered sound of her strong conviction seemed to kindle in Christine a
      livelier perception of all its bearings than she had known while it had
      lain unformulated in her mind. For when she had done speaking she fell
      down on her knees before her father, covered her face, and said, 'Please,
      please forgive me, papa! How could I do it without letting you know! I
      don't know, I don't know!'
    </p>
    <p>
      When she looked up she found that, in the turmoil of his mind, her father
      was moving about the room. 'You are within an ace of ruining yourself,
      ruining me, ruining us all!' he said. 'You are nearly as bad as your
      brother, begad!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Perhaps I am-yes-perhaps I am!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That I should father such a harum-scarum brood!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is very bad; but Nicholas-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He's a scoundrel!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He is not a scoundrel!' cried she, turning quickly. 'He's as good and
      worthy as you or I, or anybody bearing our name, or any nobleman in the
      kingdom, if you come to that! Only-only'-she could not continue the
      argument on those lines. 'Now, father, listen!' she sobbed; 'if you taunt
      me I'll go off and join him at his farm this very day, and marry him
      to-morrow, that's what I'll do!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't taant ye!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I wish to avoid unseemliness as much as you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She went away. When she came back a quarter of an hour later, thinking to
      find the room empty, he was standing there as before, never having
      apparently moved. His manner had quite changed. He seemed to take a
      resigned and entirely different view of circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Christine, here's a paragraph in the paper hinting at a secret wedding,
      and I'm blazed if it don't point to you. Well, since this was to happen,
      I'll bear it, and not complain. All volk have crosses, and this is one of
      mine. Now, this is what I've got to say-I feel that you must carry out
      this attempt at marrying Nicholas Long. Faith, you must! The rumour will
      become a scandal if you don't-that's my view. I have tried to look at the
      brightest side of the case. Nicholas Long is a young man superior to most
      of his class, and fairly presentable. And he's not poor-at least his uncle
      is not. I believe the old muddler could buy me up any day. However, a
      farmer's wife you must be, as far as I can see. As you've made your bed,
      so ye must lie. Parents propose, and ungrateful children dispose. You
      shall marry him, and immediately.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Christine hardly knew what to make of this. 'He is quite willing to wait,
      and so am I. We can wait for two or three years, and then he will be as
      worthy as-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You must marry him. And the sooner the better, if 'tis to be done at all
      . . . And yet I did wish you could have been Jim Bellston's wife. I did
      wish it! But no.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I, too, wished it and do still, in one sense,' she returned gently. His
      moderation had won her out of her defiant mood, and she was willing to
      reason with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You do?' he said surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I see that in a worldly sense my conduct with Mr. Long may be considered
      a mistake.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'H'm-I am glad to hear that-after my death you may see it more clearly
      still; and you won't have long to wait, to my reckoning.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She fell into bitter repentance, and kissed him in her anguish. 'Don't say
      that!' she cried. 'Tell me what to do?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If you'll leave me for an hour or two I'll think. Drive to the market and
      back-the carriage is at the door-and I'll try to collect my senses. Dinner
      can be put back till you return.'
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes she was dressed, and the carriage bore her up the hill
      which divided the village and manor from the market-town.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <p>
      A quarter of an hour brought her into the High Street, and for want of a
      more important errand she called at the harness-maker's for a dog-collar
      that she required.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened to be market-day, and Nicholas, having postponed the
      engagements which called him thither to keep the appointment with her in
      the Sallows, rushed off at the end of the afternoon to attend to them as
      well as he could. Arriving thus in a great hurry on account of the
      lateness of the hour, he still retained the wild, amphibious appearance
      which had marked him when he came up from the meadows to her side-an
      exceptional condition of things which had scarcely ever before occurred.
      When she crossed the pavement from the shop door, the shopman bowing and
      escorting her to the carriage, Nicholas chanced to be standing at the
      road-waggon office, talking to the master of the waggons. There were a
      good many people about, and those near paused and looked at her transit,
      in the full stroke of the level October sun, which went under the brims of
      their hats, and pierced through their button-holes. From the group she
      heard murmured the words: 'Mrs. Nicholas Long.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The unexpected remark, not without distinct satire in its tone, took her
      so greatly by surprise that she was confounded. Nicholas was by this time
      nearer, though coming against the sun he had not yet perceived her.
      Influenced by her father's lecture, she felt angry with him for being
      there and causing this awkwardness. Her notice of him was therefore
      slight, supercilious perhaps, slurred over; and her vexation at his
      presence showed distinctly in her face as she sat down in her seat.
      Instead of catching his waiting eye, she positively turned her head away.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment after she was sorry she had treated him so; but he was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reaching home she found on her dressing-table a note from her father. The
      statement was brief:
    </p>
    <p>
      I have considered and am of the same opinion. You must marry him. He can
      leave home at once and travel as proposed. I have written to him to this
      effect. I don't want any victuals, so don't wait dinner for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nicholas was the wrong kind of man to be blind to his Christine's
      mortification, though he did not know its entire cause. He had lately
      foreseen something of this sort as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It serves me right,' he thought, as he trotted homeward. 'It was
      absurd-wicked of me to lead her on so. The sacrifice would have been too
      great-too cruel!' And yet, though he thus took her part, he flushed with
      indignation every time he said to himself, 'She is ashamed of me!'
    </p>
    <p>
      On the ridge which overlooked Froom-Everard he met a neighbour of his-a
      stock-dealer-in his gig, and they drew rein and exchanged a few words. A
      part of the dealer's conversation had much meaning for Nicholas.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I've had occasion to call on Squire Everard,' the former said; 'but he
      couldn't see me on account of being quite knocked up at some bad news he
      has heard.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Nicholas rode on past Froom-Everard to Elsenford Farm, pondering. He had
      new and startling matter for thought as soon as he got there. The Squire's
      note had arrived. At first he could not credit its import; then he saw
      further, took in the tone of the letter, saw the writer's contempt behind
      the words, and understood that the letter was written as by a man hemmed
      into a corner. Christine was defiantly-insultingly-hurled at his head. He
      was accepted because he was so despised.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet with what respect he had treated her and hers! Now he was reminded
      of what an agricultural friend had said years ago, seeing the eyes of
      Nicholas fixed on Christine as on an angel when she passed: 'Better a
      little fire to warm 'ee than a great one to burn 'ee. No good can come of
      throwing your heart there.' He went into the mead, sat down, and asked
      himself four questions:
    </p>
    <p>
      1. How could she live near her acquaintance as his wife, even in his
      absence, without suffering martyrdom from the stings of their contempt?
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Would not this entail total estrangement between Christine and her
      family also, and her own consequent misery?
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Must not such isolation extinguish her affection for him?
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Supposing that her father rigged them out as colonists and sent them
      off to America, was not the effect of such exile upon one of her gentle
      nurture likely to be as the last?
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, whatever they should embark in together would be cruelty to her,
      and his death would be a relief. It would, indeed, in one aspect be a
      relief to her now, if she were so ashamed of him as she had appeared to be
      that day. Were he dead, this little episode with him would fade away like
      a dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Everard was a good-hearted man at bottom, but to take his enraged
      offer seriously was impossible. Obviously it was hotly made in his first
      bitterness at what he had heard. The least thing that he could do would be
      to go away and never trouble her more. To travel and learn and come back
      in two years, as mapped out in their first sanguine scheme, required a
      staunch heart on her side, if the necessary expenditure of time and money
      were to be afterwards justified; and it were folly to calculate on that
      when he had seen to-day that her heart was failing her already. To travel
      and disappear and not be heard of for many years would be a far more
      independent stroke, and it would leave her entirely unfettered. Perhaps he
      might rival in this kind the accomplished Mr. Bellston, of whose
      journeyings he had heard so much.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat and sat, and the fog rose out of the river, enveloping him like a
      fleece; first his feet and knees, then his arms and body, and finally
      submerging his head. When he had come to a decision he went up again into
      the homestead. He would be independent, if he died for it, and he would
      free Christine. Exile was the only course. The first step was to inform
      his uncle of his determination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days later Nicholas was on the same spot in the mead, at almost the
      same hour of eve. But there was no fog now; a blusterous autumn wind had
      ousted the still, golden days and misty nights; and he was going, full of
      purpose, in the opposite direction. When he had last entered the mead he
      was an inhabitant of the Froom valley; in forty-eight hours he had severed
      himself from that spot as completely as if he had never belonged to it.
      All that appertained to him in the Froom valley now was circumscribed by
      the portmanteau in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      In making his preparations for departure he had unconsciously held a
      faint, foolish hope that she would communicate with him and make up their
      estrangement in some soft womanly way. But she had given no signal, and it
      was too evident to him that her latest mood had grown to be her fixed one,
      proving how well founded had been his impulse to set her free.
    </p>
    <p>
      He entered the Sallows, found his way in the dark to the garden-door of
      the house, slipped under it a note to tell her of his departure, and
      explaining its true reason to be a consciousness of her growing feeling
      that he was an encumbrance and a humiliation. Of the direction of his
      journey and of the date of his return he said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      His course now took him into the high road, which he pursued for some
      miles in a north-easterly direction, still spinning the thread of sad
      inferences, and asking himself why he should ever return. At daybreak he
      stood on the hill above Shottsford-Forum, and awaited a coach which passed
      about this time along that highway towards Melchester and London.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Some fifteen years after the date of the foregoing incidents, a man who
      had dwelt in far countries, and viewed many cities, arrived at Roy-Town, a
      roadside hamlet on the old western turnpike road, not five miles from
      Froom-Everard, and put up at the Buck's Head, an isolated inn at that
      spot. He was still barely of middle age, but it could be seen that a haze
      of grey was settling upon the locks of his hair, and that his face had
      lost colour and curve, as if by exposure to bleaching climates and strange
      atmospheres, or from ailments incidental thereto. He seemed to observe
      little around him, by reason of the intrusion of his musings upon the
      scene. In truth Nicholas Long was just now the creature of old hopes and
      fears consequent upon his arrival-this man who once had not cared if his
      name were blotted out from that district. The evening light showed wistful
      lines which he could not smooth away by the worldling's gloss of
      nonchalance that he had learnt to fling over his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Buck's Head was a somewhat unusual place for a man of this sort to
      choose as a house of sojourn in preference to some Casterbridge inn four
      miles further on. Before he left home it had been a lively old tavern at
      which High-flyers, and Heralds, and Tally-hoes had changed horses on their
      stages up and down the country; but now the house was rather cavernous and
      chilly, the stable-roofs were hollow-backed, the landlord was asthmatic,
      and the traffic gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      He arrived in the afternoon, and when he had sent back the fly and was
      having a nondescript meal, he put a question to the waiting-maid with a
      mien of indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Squire Everard, of Froom-Everard Manor, has been dead some years, I
      believe?'
    </p>
    <p>
      She replied in the affirmative.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And are any of the family left there still?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no, bless you, sir! They sold the place years ago-Squire Everard's son
      did-and went away. I've never heard where they went to. They came quite to
      nothing.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never heard anything of the young lady-the Squire's daughter?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No. You see 'twas before I came to these parts.'
    </p>
    <p>
      When the waitress left the room, Nicholas pushed aside his plate and gazed
      out of the window. He was not going over into the Froom Valley altogether
      on Christine's account, but she had greatly animated his motive in coming
      that way. Anyhow he would push on there now that he was so near, and not
      ask questions here where he was liable to be wrongly informed. The
      fundamental inquiry he had not ventured to make-whether Christine had
      married before the family went away. He had abstained because of an absurd
      dread of extinguishing hopeful surmise. That the Everards had left their
      old home was bad enough intelligence for one day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rising from the table he put on his hat and went out, ascending towards
      the upland which divided this district from his native vale. The first
      familiar feature that met his eye was a little spot on the distant sky-a
      clump of trees standing on a barrow which surmounted a yet more remote
      upland-a point where, in his childhood, he had believed people could stand
      and see America. He reached the further verge of the plateau on which he
      had entered. Ah, there was the valley-a greenish-grey stretch of
      colour-still looking placid and serene, as though it had not much missed
      him. If Christine was no longer there, why should he pause over it this
      evening? His uncle and aunt were dead, and to-morrow would be soon enough
      to inquire for remoter relatives. Thus, disinclined to go further, he
      turned to retrace his way to the inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the backward path he now perceived the figure of a woman, who had been
      walking at a distance behind him; and as she drew nearer he began to be
      startled. Surely, despite the variations introduced into that figure by
      changing years, its ground-lines were those of Christine?
    </p>
    <p>
      Nicholas had been sentimental enough to write to Christine immediately on
      landing at Southampton a day or two before this, addressing his letter at
      a venture to the old house, and merely telling her that he planned to
      reach the Roy-Town inn on the present afternoon. The news of the
      scattering of the Everards had dissipated his hope of hearing of her; but
      here she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they met-there, alone, on the open down by a pond, just as if the
      meeting had been carefully arranged.
    </p>
    <p>
      She threw up her veil. She was still beautiful, though the years had
      touched her; a little more matronly-much more homely. Or was it only that
      he was much less homely now-a man of the world-the sense of homeliness
      being relative? Her face had grown to be pre-eminently of the sort that
      would be called interesting. Her habiliments were of a demure and sober
      cast, though she was one who had used to dress so airily and so gaily.
      Years had laid on a few shadows too in this.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I received your letter,' she said, when the momentary embarrassment of
      their first approach had passed. 'And I thought I would walk across the
      hills to-day, as it was fine. I have just called at the inn, and they told
      me you were out. I was now on my way homeward.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He hardly listened to this, though he intently gazed at her. 'Christine,'
      he said, 'one word. Are you free?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I-I am in a certain sense,' she replied, colouring.
    </p>
    <p>
      The announcement had a magical effect. The intervening time between past
      and present closed up for him, and moved by an impulse which he had
      combated for fifteen years, he seized her two hands and drew her towards
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She started back, and became almost a mere acquaintance. 'I have to tell
      you,' she gasped, 'that I have-been married.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Nicholas's rose-coloured dream was immediately toned down to a greyish
      tinge.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I did not marry till many years after you had left,' she continued in the
      humble tones of one confessing to a crime. 'Oh Nic,' she cried
      reproachfully, 'how could you stay away so long?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Whom did you marry?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr. Bellston.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I-ought to have expected it.' He was going to add, 'And is he dead?' but
      he checked himself. Her dress unmistakably suggested widowhood; and she
      had said she was free.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I must now hasten home,' said she. 'I felt that, considering my
      shortcomings at our parting so many years ago, I owed you the initiative
      now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'There is some of your old generosity in that. I'll walk with you, if I
      may. Where are you living, Christine?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'In the same house, but not on the old conditions. I have part of it on
      lease; the farmer now tenanting the premises found the whole more than he
      wanted, and the owner allowed me to keep what rooms I chose. I am poor
      now, you know, Nicholas, and almost friendless. My brother sold the
      Froom-Everard estate when it came to him, and the person who bought it
      turned our home into a farmhouse. Till my father's death my husband and I
      lived in the manor-house with him, so that I have never lived away from
      the spot.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She was poor. That, and the change of name, sufficiently accounted for the
      inn-servant's ignorance of her continued existence within the walls of her
      old home.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was growing dusk, and he still walked with her. A woman's head arose
      from the declivity before them, and as she drew nearer, Christine asked
      him to go back.
    </p>
    <p>
      'This is the wife of the farmer who shares the house,' she said. 'She is
      accustomed to come out and meet me whenever I walk far and am benighted. I
      am obliged to walk everywhere now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The farmer's wife, seeing that Christine was not alone, paused in her
      advance, and Nicholas said, 'Dear Christine, if you are obliged to do
      these things, I am not, and what wealth I can command you may command
      likewise. They say rolling stones gather no moss; but they gather dross
      sometimes. I was one of the pioneers to the gold-fields, you know, and
      made a sufficient fortune there for my wants. What is more, I kept it.
      When I had done this I was coming home, but hearing of my uncle's death I
      changed my plan, travelled, speculated, and increased my fortune. Now,
      before we part: you remember you stood with me at the altar once, and
      therefore I speak with less preparation than I should otherwise use.
      Before we part then I ask, shall another again intrude between us? Or
      shall we complete the union we began?'
    </p>
    <p>
      She trembled-just as she had done at that very minute of standing with him
      in the church, to which he had recalled her mind. 'I will not enter into
      that now, dear Nicholas,' she replied. 'There will be more to talk of and
      consider first-more to explain, which it would have spoiled this meeting
      to have entered into now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, yes; but-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Further than the brief answer I first gave, Nic, don't press me to-
      night. I still have the old affection for you, or I should not have sought
      you. Let that suffice for the moment.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very well, dear one. And when shall I call to see you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will write and fix an hour. I will tell you everything of my history
      then.'
    </p>
    <p>
      And thus they parted, Nicholas feeling that he had not come here
      fruitlessly. When she and her companion were out of sight he retraced his
      steps to Roy-Town, where he made himself as comfortable as he could in the
      deserted old inn of his boyhood's days. He missed her companionship this
      evening more than he had done at any time during the whole fifteen years;
      and it was as though instead of separation there had been constant
      communion with her throughout that period. The tones of her voice had
      stirred his heart in a nook which had lain stagnant ever since he last
      heard them. They recalled the woman to whom he had once lifted his eyes as
      to a goddess. Her announcement that she had been another's came as a
      little shock to him, and he did not now lift his eyes to her in precisely
      the same way as he had lifted them at first. But he forgave her for
      marrying Bellston; what could he expect after fifteen years?
    </p>
    <p>
      He slept at Roy-Town that night, and in the morning there was a short note
      from her, repeating more emphatically her statement of the previous
      evening-that she wished to inform him clearly of her circumstances, and to
      calmly consider with him the position in which she was placed. Would he
      call upon her on Sunday afternoon, when she was sure to be alone?
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nic,' she wrote on, 'what a cosmopolite you are! I expected to find my
      old yeoman still; but I was quite awed in the presence of such a citizen
      of the world. Did I seem rusty and unpractised? Ah-you seemed so once to
      me!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Tender playful words; the old Christine was in them. She said Sunday
      afternoon, and it was now only Saturday morning. He wished she had said
      to-day; that short revival of her image had vitalized to sudden heat
      feelings that had almost been stilled. Whatever she might have to explain
      as to her position-and it was awkwardly narrowed, no doubt-he could not
      give her up. Miss Everard or Mrs. Bellston, what mattered it?-she was the
      same Christine.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not go outside the inn all Saturday. He had no wish to see or do
      anything but to await the coming interview. So he smoked, and read the
      local newspaper of the previous week, and stowed himself in the chimney-
      corner. In the evening he felt that he could remain indoors no longer, and
      the moon being near the full, he started from the inn on foot in the same
      direction as that of yesterday, with the view of contemplating the old
      village and its precincts, and hovering round her house under the cloak of
      night.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a stout stick in his hand he climbed over the five miles of upland in
      a comparatively short space of time. Nicholas had seen many strange lands
      and trodden many strange ways since he last walked that path, but as he
      trudged he seemed wonderfully like his old self, and had not the slightest
      difficulty in finding the way. In descending to the meads the streams
      perplexed him a little, some of the old foot-bridges having been removed;
      but he ultimately got across the larger water-courses, and pushed on to
      the village, avoiding her residence for the moment, lest she should
      encounter him, and think he had not respected the time of her appointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found his way to the churchyard, and first ascertained where lay the
      two relations he had left alive at his departure; then he observed the
      gravestones of other inhabitants with whom he had been well acquainted,
      till by degrees he seemed to be in the society of all the elder Froom-
      Everard population, as he had known the place. Side by side as they had
      lived in his day here were they now. They had moved house in mass.
    </p>
    <p>
      But no tomb of Mr. Bellston was visible, though, as he had lived at the
      manor-house, it would have been natural to find it here. In truth Nicholas
      was more anxious to discover that than anything, being curious to know how
      long he had been dead. Seeing from the glimmer of a light in the church
      that somebody was there cleaning for Sunday he entered, and looked round
      upon the walls as well as he could. But there was no monument to her
      husband, though one had been erected to the Squire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nicholas addressed the young man who was sweeping. 'I don't see any
      monument or tomb to the late Mr. Bellston?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no, sir; you won't see that,' said the young man drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, pray?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Because he's not buried here. He's not Christian-buried anywhere, as far
      as we know. In short, perhaps he's not buried at all; and between
      ourselves, perhaps he's alive.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Nicholas sank an inch shorter. 'Ah,' he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then you don't know the peculiar circumstances, sir?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am a stranger here-as to late years.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr. Bellston was a traveller-an explorer-it was his calling; you may have
      heard his name as such?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I remember.' Nicholas recalled the fact that this very bent of Mr.
      Bellston's was the incentive to his own roaming.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, when he married he came and lived here with his wife and his wife's
      father, and said he would travel no more. But after a time he got weary of
      biding quiet here, and weary of her-he was not a good husband to the young
      lady by any means-and he betook himself again to his old trick of
      roving-with her money. Away he went, quite out of the realm of human foot,
      into the bowels of Asia, and never was heard of more. He was murdered, it
      is said, but nobody knows; though as that was nine years ago he's dead
      enough in principle, if not in corporation. His widow lives quite humble,
      for between her husband and her brother she's left in very lean
      pasturage.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Nicholas went back to the Buck's Head without hovering round her dwelling.
      This then was the explanation which she had wanted to make. Not dead, but
      missing. How could he have expected that the first fair promise of
      happiness held out to him would remain untarnished? She had said that she
      was free; and legally she was free, no doubt. Moreover, from her tone and
      manner he felt himself justified in concluding that she would be willing
      to run the risk of a union with him, in the improbability of her husband's
      existence. Even if that husband lived, his return was not a likely event,
      to judge from his character. A man who could spend her money on his own
      personal adventures would not be anxious to disturb her poverty after such
      a lapse of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, the prospect was not so unclouded as it had seemed. But could he,
      even now, give up Christine?

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Two months more brought the year nearly to a close, and found Nicholas
      Long tenant of a spacious house in the market-town nearest to Froom-
      Everard. A man of means, genial character, and a bachelor, he was an
      object of great interest to his neighbours, and to his neighbours' wives
      and daughters. But he took little note of this, and had made it his
      business to go twice a week, no matter what the weather, to the now
      farmhouse at Froom-Everard, a wing of which had been retained as the
      refuge of Christine. He always walked, to give no trouble in putting up a
      horse to a housekeeper whose staff was limited.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two had put their heads together on the situation, had gone to a
      solicitor, had balanced possibilities, and had resolved to make the plunge
      of matrimony. 'Nothing venture, nothing have,' Christine had said, with
      some of her old audacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      With almost gratuitous honesty they had let their intentions be widely
      known. Christine, it is true, had rather shrunk from publicity at first;
      but Nicholas argued that their boldness in this respect would have good
      results. With his friends he held that there was not the slightest
      probability of her being other than a widow, and a challenge to the
      missing man now, followed by no response, would stultify any unpleasant
      remarks which might be thrown at her after their union. To this end a
      paragraph was inserted in the Wessex papers, announcing that their
      marriage was proposed to be celebrated on such and such a day in December.
    </p>
    <p>
      His periodic walks along the south side of the valley to visit her were
      among the happiest experiences of his life. The yellow leaves falling
      around him in the foreground, the well-watered meads on the left hand, and
      the woman he loved awaiting him at the back of the scene, promised a
      future of much serenity, as far as human judgment could foresee. On
      arriving, he would sit with her in the 'parlour' of the wing she retained,
      her general sitting-room, where the only relics of her early surroundings
      were an old clock from the other end of the house, and her own piano.
      Before it was quite dark they would stand, hand in hand, looking out of
      the window across the flat turf to the dark clump of trees which hid
      further view from their eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you wish you were still mistress here, dear?' he once said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not at all,' said she cheerfully. 'I have a good enough room, and a good
      enough fire, and a good enough friend. Besides, my latter days as mistress
      of the house were not happy ones, and they spoilt the place for me. It was
      a punishment for my faithlessness. Nic, you do forgive me? Really you do?'
    </p>
    <p>
      The twenty-third of December, the eve of the wedding-day, had arrived at
      last in the train of such uneventful ones as these. Nicholas had arranged
      to visit her that day a little later than usual, and see that everything
      was ready with her for the morrow's event and her removal to his house;
      for he had begun to look after her domestic affairs, and to lighten as
      much as possible the duties of her housekeeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was to come to an early supper, which she had arranged to take the
      place of a wedding-breakfast next day-the latter not being feasible in her
      present situation. An hour or so after dark the wife of the farmer who
      lived in the other part of the house entered Christine's parlour to lay
      the cloth.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What with getting the ham skinned, and the black-puddings hotted up,' she
      said, 'it will take me all my time before he's here, if I begin this
      minute.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll lay the table myself,' said Christine, jumping up. 'Do you attend to
      the cooking.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Thank you, ma'am. And perhaps 'tis no matter, seeing that it is the last
      night you'll have to do such work. I knew this sort of life wouldn't last
      long for 'ee, being born to better things.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It has lasted rather long, Mrs. Wake. And if he had not found me out it
      would have lasted all my days.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But he did find you out.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He did. And I'll lay the cloth immediately.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wake went back to the kitchen, and Christine began to bustle about.
      She greatly enjoyed preparing this table for Nicholas and herself with her
      own hands. She took artistic pleasure in adjusting each article to its
      position, as if half an inch error were a point of high importance.
      Finally she placed the two candles where they were to stand, and sat down
      by the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wake re-entered and regarded the effect. 'Why not have another candle
      or two, ma'am?' she said. ''Twould make it livelier. Say four.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very well,' said Christine, and four candles were lighted. 'Really,' she
      added, surveying them, 'I have been now so long accustomed to little
      economies that they look quite extravagant.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, you'll soon think nothing of forty in his grand new house! Shall I
      bring in supper directly he comes, ma'am?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, not for half an hour; and, Mrs. Wake, you and Betsy are busy in the
      kitchen, I know; so when he knocks don't disturb yourselves; I can let him
      in.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She was again left alone, and, as it still wanted some time to Nicholas's
      appointment, she stood by the fire, looking at herself in the glass over
      the mantel. Reflectively raising a lock of her hair just above her temple
      she uncovered a small scar. That scar had a history. The terrible temper
      of her late husband-those sudden moods of irascibility which had made even
      his friendly excitements look like anger-had once caused him to set that
      mark upon her with the bezel of a ring he wore. He declared that the whole
      thing was an accident. She was a woman, and kept her own opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christine then turned her back to the glass and scanned the table and the
      candles, shining one at each corner like types of the four Evangelists,
      and thought they looked too assuming-too confident. She glanced up at the
      clock, which stood also in this room, there not being space enough for it
      in the passage. It was nearly seven, and she expected Nicholas at
      half-past. She liked the company of this venerable article in her lonely
      life: its tickings and whizzings were a sort of conversation. It now began
      to strike the hour. At the end something grated slightly. Then, without
      any warning, the clock slowly inclined forward and fell at full length
      upon the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crash brought the farmer's wife rushing into the room. Christine had
      well-nigh sprung out of her shoes. Mrs. Wake's enquiry what had happened
      was answered by the evidence of her own eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How did it occur?' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I cannot say; it was not firmly fixed, I suppose. Dear me, how sorry I
      am! My dear father's hall-clock! And now I suppose it is ruined.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Assisted by Mrs. Wake, she lifted the clock. Every inch of glass was, of
      course, shattered, but very little harm besides appeared to be done. They
      propped it up temporarily, though it would not go again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christine had soon recovered her composure, but she saw that Mrs. Wake was
      gloomy. 'What does it mean, Mrs. Wake?' she said. 'Is it ominous?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is a sign of a violent death in the family.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't talk of it. I don't believe such things; and don't mention it to
      Mr. Long when he comes. He's not in the family yet, you know.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no, it cannot refer to him,' said Mrs. Wake musingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Some remote cousin, perhaps,' observed Christine, no less willing to
      humour her than to get rid of a shapeless dread which the incident had
      caused in her own mind. 'And-supper is almost ready, Mrs. Wake?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'In three-quarters of an hour.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wake left the room, and Christine sat on. Though it still wanted
      fifteen minutes to the hour at which Nicholas had promised to be there,
      she began to grow impatient. After the accustomed ticking the dead silence
      was oppressive. But she had not to wait so long as she had expected; steps
      were heard approaching the door, and there was a knock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christine was already there to open it. The entrance had no lamp, but it
      was not particularly dark out of doors. She could see the outline of a
      man, and cried cheerfully, 'You are early; it is very good of you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I beg pardon. It is not Mr. Bellston himself-only a messenger with his
      bag and great-coat. But he will be here soon.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice was not the voice of Nicholas, and the intelligence was strange.
      'I-I don't understand. Mr. Bellston?' she faintly replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, ma'am. A gentleman-a stranger to me-gave me these things at
      Casterbridge station to bring on here, and told me to say that Mr.
      Bellston had arrived there, and is detained for half-an-hour, but will be
      here in the course of the evening.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She sank into a chair. The porter put a small battered portmanteau on the
      floor, the coat on a chair, and looking into the room at the spread table
      said, 'If you are disappointed, ma'am, that your husband (as I s'pose he
      is) is not come, I can assure you he'll soon be here. He's stopped to get
      a shave, to my thinking, seeing he wanted it. What he said was that I
      could tell you he had heard the news in Ireland, and would have come
      sooner, his hand being forced; but was hindered crossing by the weather,
      having took passage in a sailing vessel. What news he meant he didn't
      say.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, yes,' she faltered. It was plain that the man knew nothing of her
      intended re-marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mechanically rising and giving him a shilling, she answered to his
      'good-night,' and he withdrew, the beat of his footsteps lessening in the
      distance. She was alone; but in what a solitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christine stood in the middle of the hall, just as the man had left her,
      in the gloomy silence of the stopped clock within the adjoining room, till
      she aroused herself, and turning to the portmanteau and great-coat brought
      them to the light of the candles, and examined them. The portmanteau bore
      painted upon it the initials 'J. B.' in white letters-the well-known
      initials of her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      She examined the great-coat. In the breast-pocket was an empty spirit
      flask, which she firmly fancied she recognized as the one she had filled
      many times for him when he was living at home with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned desultorily hither and thither, until she heard another tread
      without, and there came a second knocking at the door. She did not respond
      to it; and Nicholas-for it was he-thinking that he was not heard by reason
      of a concentration on to-morrow's proceedings, opened the door softly, and
      came on to the door of her room, which stood unclosed, just as it had been
      left by the Casterbridge porter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nicholas uttered a blithe greeting, cast his eye round the parlour, which
      with its tall candles, blazing fire, snow-white cloth, and prettily-spread
      table, formed a cheerful spectacle enough for a man who had been walking
      in the dark for an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My bride-almost, at last!' he cried, encircling her with his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of responding, her figure became limp, frigid, heavy; her head
      fell back, and he found that she had fainted.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was natural, he thought. She had had many little worrying matters to
      attend to, and but slight assistance. He ought to have seen more
      effectually to her affairs; the closeness of the event had over-excited
      her. Nicholas kissed her unconscious face-more than once, little thinking
      what news it was that had changed its aspect. Loth to call Mrs. Wake, he
      carried Christine to a couch and laid her down. This had the effect of
      reviving her. Nicholas bent and whispered in her ear, 'Lie quiet, dearest,
      no hurry; and dream, dream, dream of happy days. It is only I. You will
      soon be better.' He held her by the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, no, no!' she said, with a stare. 'O, how can this be?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Nicholas was alarmed and perplexed, but the disclosure was not long
      delayed. When she had sat up, and by degrees made the stunning event known
      to him, he stood as if transfixed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah-is it so?' said he. Then, becoming quite meek, 'And why was he so
      cruel as to-delay his return till now?'
    </p>
    <p>
      She dutifully recited the explanation her husband had given her through
      the messenger; but her mechanical manner of telling it showed how much she
      doubted its truth. It was too unlikely that his arrival at such a dramatic
      moment should not be a contrived surprise, quite of a piece with his
      previous dealings towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But perhaps it may be true-and he may have become kind now-not as he used
      to be,' she faltered. 'Yes, perhaps, Nicholas, he is an altered man-we'll
      hope he is. I suppose I ought not to have listened to my legal advisers,
      and assumed his death so surely! Anyhow, I am roughly received back
      into-the right way!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Nicholas burst out bitterly: 'O what too, too honest fools we were!-to so
      court daylight upon our intention by putting that announcement in the
      papers! Why could we not have married privately, and gone away, so that he
      would never have known what had become of you, even if he had returned?
      Christine, he has done it to . . . But I'll say no more. Of course
      we-might fly now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, no; we might not,' said she hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very well. But this is hard to bear! "When I looked for good then evil
      came unto me, and when I waited for light there came darkness." So once
      said a sorely tried man in the land of Uz, and so say I now! . . . I
      wonder if he is almost here at this moment?'
    </p>
    <p>
      She told him she supposed Bellston was approaching by the path across the
      fields, having sent on his great-coat, which he would not want walking.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And is this meal laid for him, or for me?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It was laid for you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And it will be eaten by him?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Christine, are you sure that he is come, or have you been sleeping over
      the fire and dreaming it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      She pointed anew to the portmanteau with the initials 'J. B.,' and to the
      coat beside it.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, good-bye-good-bye! Curse that parson for not marrying us fifteen
      years ago!'
    </p>
    <p>
      It is unnecessary to dwell further upon that parting. There are scenes
      wherein the words spoken do not even approximate to the level of the
      mental communion between the actors. Suffice it to say that part they did,
      and quickly; and Nicholas, more dead than alive, went out of the house
      homewards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why had he ever come back? During his absence he had not cared for
      Christine as he cared now. If he had been younger he might have felt
      tempted to descend into the meads instead of keeping along their edge. The
      Froom was down there, and he knew of quiet pools in that stream to which
      death would come easily. But he was too old to put an end to himself for
      such a reason as love; and another thought, too, kept him from seriously
      contemplating any desperate act. His affection for her was strongly
      protective, and in the event of her requiring a friend's support in future
      troubles there was none but himself left in the world to afford it. So he
      walked on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Christine had resigned herself to circumstances. A resolve to
      continue worthy of her history and of her family lent her heroism and
      dignity. She called Mrs. Wake, and explained to that worthy woman as much
      of what had occurred as she deemed necessary. Mrs. Wake was too amazed to
      reply; she retreated slowly, her lips parted; till at the door she said
      with a dry mouth, 'And the beautiful supper, ma'am?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Serve it when he comes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'When Mr. Bellston-yes, ma'am, I will.' She still stood gazing, as if she
      could hardly take in the order.
    </p>
    <p>
      'That will do, Mrs. Wake. I am much obliged to you for all your kindness.'
      And Christine was left alone again, and then she wept.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat down and waited. That awful silence of the stopped clock began
      anew, but she did not mind it now. She was listening for a footfall in a
      state of mental tensity which almost took away from her the power of
      motion. It seemed to her that the natural interval for her husband's
      journey thither must have expired; but she was not sure, and waited on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wake again came in. 'You have not rung for supper-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He is not yet come, Mrs. Wake. If you want to go to bed, bring in the
      supper and set it on the table. It will be nearly as good cold. Leave the
      door unbarred.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wake did as was suggested, made up the fire, and went away. Shortly
      afterwards Christine heard her retire to her chamber. But Christine still
      sat on, and still her husband postponed his entry.
    </p>
    <p>
      She aroused herself once or twice to freshen the fire, but was ignorant
      how the night was going. Her watch was upstairs and she did not make the
      effort to go up to consult it. In her seat she continued; and still the
      supper waited, and still he did not come.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length she was so nearly persuaded that the arrival of his things must
      have been a dream after all, that she again went over to them, felt them,
      and examined them. His they unquestionably were; and their forwarding by
      the porter had been quite natural. She sighed and sat down again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently she fell into a doze, and when she again became conscious she
      found that the four candles had burnt into their sockets and gone out. The
      fire still emitted a feeble shine. Christine did not take the trouble to
      get more candles, but stirred the fire and sat on.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a long period she heard a creaking of the chamber floor and stairs
      at the other end of the house, and knew that the farmer's family were
      getting up. By-and-by Mrs. Wake entered the room, candle in hand, bouncing
      open the door in her morning manner, obviously without any expectation of
      finding a person there.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lord-a-mercy! What, sitting here again, ma'am?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, I am sitting here still.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You've been there ever since last night?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He's not come.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, he won't come at this time o' morning,' said the farmer's wife. 'Do
      'ee get on to bed, ma'am. You must be shrammed to death!'
    </p>
    <p>
      It occurred to Christine now that possibly her husband had thought better
      of obtruding himself upon her company within an hour of revealing his
      existence to her, and had decided to pay a more formal visit next day. She
      therefore adopted Mrs. Wake's suggestion and retired.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Nicholas had gone straight home, neither speaking to nor seeing a soul.
      From that hour a change seemed to come over him. He had ever possessed a
      full share of self-consciousness; he had been readily piqued, had shown an
      unusual dread of being personally obtrusive. But now his sense of self, as
      an individual provoking opinion, appeared to leave him. When, therefore,
      after a day or two of seclusion, he came forth again, and the few
      acquaintances he had formed in the town condoled with him on what had
      happened, and pitied his haggard looks, he did not shrink from their
      regard as he would have done formerly, but took their sympathy as it would
      have been accepted by a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      It reached his ears that Bellston had not appeared on the evening of his
      arrival at any hotel in the town or neighbourhood, or entered his wife's
      house at all. 'That's a part of his cruelty,' thought Nicholas. And when
      two or three days had passed, and still no account came to him of Bellston
      having joined her, he ventured to set out for Froom-Everard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christine was so shaken that she was obliged to receive him as she lay on
      a sofa, beside the square table which was to have borne their evening
      feast. She fixed her eyes wistfully upon him, and smiled a sad smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He has not come?' said Nicholas under his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He has not.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Nicholas sat beside her, and they talked on general topics merely
      like saddened old friends. But they could not keep away the subject of
      Bellston, their voices dropping as it forced its way in. Christine, no
      less than Nicholas, knowing her husband's character, inferred that, having
      stopped her game, as he would have phrased it, he was taking things
      leisurely, and, finding nothing very attractive in her limited mode of
      living, was meaning to return to her only when he had nothing better to
      do.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bolt which laid low their hopes had struck so recently that they could
      hardly look each other in the face when speaking that day. But when a week
      or two had passed, and all the horizon still remained as vacant of
      Bellston as before, Nicholas and she could talk of the event with calm
      wonderment. Why had he come, to go again like this?
    </p>
    <p>
      And then there set in a period of resigned surmise, during which
    </p>
    <p>
      So like, so very like, was day to day,
    </p>
    <p>
      that to tell of one of them is to tell of all. Nicholas would arrive
      between three and four in the afternoon, a faint trepidation influencing
      his walk as he neared her door. He would knock; she would always reply in
      person, having watched for him from the window. Then he would whisper-'He
      has not come?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He has not,' she would say.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nicholas would enter then, and she being ready bonneted, they would walk
      into the Sallows together as far as to the spot which they had frequently
      made their place of appointment in their youthful days. A plank bridge,
      which Bellston had caused to be thrown over the stream during his
      residence with her in the manor-house, was now again removed, and all was
      just the same as in Nicholas's time, when he had been accustomed to wade
      across on the edge of the cascade and come up to her like a merman from
      the deep. Here on the felled trunk, which still lay rotting in its old
      place, they would now sit, gazing at the descending sheet of water, with
      its never-ending sarcastic hiss at their baffled attempts to make
      themselves one flesh. Returning to the house they would sit down together
      to tea, after which, and the confidential chat that accompanied it, he
      walked home by the declining light. This proceeding became as periodic as
      an astronomical recurrence. Twice a week he came-all through that winter,
      all through the spring following, through the summer, through the autumn,
      the next winter, the next year, and the next, till an appreciable span of
      human life had passed by. Bellston still tarried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Years and years Nic walked that way, at this interval of three days, from
      his house in the neighbouring town; and in every instance the aforesaid
      order of things was customary; and still on his arrival the form of words
      went on-'He has not come?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He has not.'
    </p>
    <p>
      So they grew older. The dim shape of that third one stood continually
      between them; they could not displace it; neither, on the other hand,
      could it effectually part them. They were in close communion, yet not
      indissolubly united; lovers, yet never growing cured of love. By the time
      that the fifth year of Nic's visiting had arrived, on about the
      five-hundredth occasion of his presence at her tea-table, he noticed that
      the bleaching process which had begun upon his own locks was also
      spreading to hers. He told her so, and they laughed. Yet she was in good
      health: a condition of suspense, which would have half-killed a man, had
      been endured by her without complaint, and even with composure.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, when these years of abeyance had numbered seven, they had
      strolled as usual as far as the waterfall, whose faint roar formed a sort
      of calling voice sufficient in the circumstances to direct their
      listlessness. Pausing there, he looked up at her face and said, 'Why
      should we not try again, Christine? We are legally at liberty to do so
      now. Nothing venture nothing have.'
    </p>
    <p>
      But she would not. Perhaps a little primness of idea was by this time
      ousting the native daring of Christine. 'What he has done once he can do
      twice,' she said. 'He is not dead, and if we were to marry he would say we
      had "forced his hand," as he said before, and duly reappear.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Some years after, when Christine was about fifty, and Nicholas fifty-
      three, a new trouble of a minor kind arrived. He found an inconvenience in
      traversing the distance between their two houses, particularly in damp
      weather, the years he had spent in trying climates abroad having sown the
      seeds of rheumatism, which made a journey undesirable on inclement days,
      even in a carriage. He told her of this new difficulty, as he did of
      everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      'If you could live nearer,' suggested she.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unluckily there was no house near. But Nicholas, though not a millionaire,
      was a man of means; he obtained a small piece of ground on lease at the
      nearest spot to her home that it could be so obtained, which was on the
      opposite brink of the Froom, this river forming the boundary of the
      Froom-Everard manor; and here he built a cottage large enough for his
      wants. This took time, and when he got into it he found its situation a
      great comfort to him. He was not more than five hundred yards from her
      now, and gained a new pleasure in feeling that all sounds which greeted
      his ears, in the day or in the night, also fell upon hers-the caw of a
      particular rook, the voice of a neighbouring nightingale, the whistle of a
      local breeze, or the purl of the fall in the meadows, whose rush was a
      material rendering of Time's ceaseless scour over themselves, wearing them
      away without uniting them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christine's missing husband was taking shape as a myth among the
      surrounding residents; but he was still believed in as corporeally
      imminent by Christine herself, and also, in a milder degree, by Nicholas.
      For a curious unconsciousness of the long lapse of time since his
      revelation of himself seemed to affect the pair. There had been no passing
      events to serve as chronological milestones, and the evening on which she
      had kept supper waiting for him still loomed out with startling nearness
      in their retrospects.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the seventeenth pensive year of this their parallel march towards the
      common bourne, a labourer came in a hurry one day to Nicholas's house and
      brought strange tidings. The present owner of Froom-Everard-a non-
      resident-had been improving his property in sundry ways, and one of these
      was by dredging the stream which, in the course of years, had become
      choked with mud and weeds in its passage through the Sallows. The process
      necessitated a reconstruction of the waterfall. When the river had been
      pumped dry for this purpose, the skeleton of a man had been found jammed
      among the piles supporting the edge of the fall. Every particle of his
      flesh and clothing had been eaten by fishes or abraded to nothing by the
      water, but the relics of a gold watch remained, and on the inside of the
      case was engraved the name of the maker of her husband's watch, which she
      well remembered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nicholas, deeply agitated, hastened down to the place and examined the
      remains attentively, afterwards going across to Christine, and breaking
      the discovery to her. She would not come to view the skeleton, which lay
      extended on the grass, not a finger or toe-bone missing, so neatly had the
      aquatic operators done their work. Conjecture was directed to the question
      how Bellston had got there; and conjecture alone could give an
      explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was supposed that, on his way to call upon her, he had taken a short
      cut through the grounds, with which he was naturally very familiar, and
      coming to the fall under the trees had expected to find there the plank
      which, during his occupancy of the premises with Christine and her father,
      he had placed there for crossing into the meads on the other side instead
      of wading across as Nicholas had done. Before discovering its removal he
      had probably overbalanced himself, and was thus precipitated into the
      cascade, the piles beneath the descending current wedging him between them
      like the prongs of a pitchfork, and effectually preventing the rising of
      his body, over which the weeds grew. Such was the reasonable supposition
      concerning the discovery; but proof was never forthcoming.
    </p>
    <p>
      'To think,' said Nicholas, when the remains had been decently interred,
      and he was again sitting with Christine-though not beside the
      waterfall-'to think how we visited him! How we sat over him, hours and
      hours, gazing at him, bewailing our fate, when all the time he was
      ironically hissing at us from the spot, in an unknown tongue, that we
      could marry if we chose!'
    </p>
    <p>
      She echoed the sentiment with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have strange fancies,' she said. 'I suppose it must have been my
      husband who came back, and not some other man.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Nicholas felt that there was little doubt. 'Besides-the skeleton,' he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes . . . If it could not have been another person's-but no, of course it
      was he.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You might have married me on the day we had fixed, and there would have
      been no impediment. You would now have been seventeen years my wife, and
      we might have had tall sons and daughters.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It might have been so,' she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well-is it still better late than never?'
    </p>
    <p>
      The question was one which had become complicated by the increasing years
      of each. Their wills were somewhat enfeebled now, their hearts sickened of
      tender enterprise by hope too long deferred. Having postponed the
      consideration of their course till a year after the interment of Bellston,
      each seemed less disposed than formerly to take it up again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is it worth while, after so many years?' she said to him. 'We are fairly
      happy as we are-perhaps happier than we should be in any other relation,
      seeing what old people we have grown. The weight is gone from our lives;
      the shadow no longer divides us: then let us be joyful together as we are,
      dearest Nic, in the days of our vanity; and
    </p>
    <p>
      With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He fell in with these views of hers to some extent. But occasionally he
      ventured to urge her to reconsider the case, though he spoke not with the
      fervour of his earlier years.

      CHAPTER I.-SHE MISSES HER SISTER
    </h2>
    <p>
      July 7.-I wander about the house in a mood of unutterable sadness, for my
      dear sister Caroline has left home to-day with my mother, and I shall not
      see them again for several weeks. They have accepted a long- standing
      invitation to visit some old friends of ours, the Marlets, who live at
      Versailles for cheapness-my mother thinking that it will be for the good
      of Caroline to see a little of France and Paris. But I don't quite like
      her going. I fear she may lose some of that childlike simplicity and
      gentleness which so characterize her, and have been nourished by the
      seclusion of our life here. Her solicitude about her pony before starting
      was quite touching, and she made me promise to visit it daily, and see
      that it came to no harm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Caroline gone abroad, and I left here! It is the reverse of an ordinary
      situation, for good or ill-luck has mostly ordained that I should be the
      absent one. Mother will be quite tired out by the young enthusiasm of
      Caroline. She will demand to be taken everywhere-to Paris continually, of
      course; to all the stock shrines of history's devotees; to palaces and
      prisons; to kings' tombs and queens' tombs; to cemeteries and
      picture-galleries, and royal hunting forests. My poor mother, having gone
      over most of this ground many times before, will perhaps not find the
      perambulation so exhilarating as will Caroline herself. I wish I could
      have gone with them. I would not have minded having my legs walked off to
      please Caroline. But this regret is absurd: I could not, of course, leave
      my father with not a soul in the house to attend to the calls of the
      parishioners or to pour out his tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      July 15.-A letter from Caroline to-day. It is very strange that she tells
      me nothing which I expected her to tell-only trivial details. She seems
      dazzled by the brilliancy of Paris-which no doubt appears still more
      brilliant to her from the fact of her only being able to obtain occasional
      glimpses of it. She would see that Paris, too, has a seamy side if you
      live there. I was not aware that the Marlets knew so many people. If, as
      mother has said, they went to reside at Versailles for reasons of economy,
      they will not effect much in that direction while they make a practice of
      entertaining all the acquaintances who happen to be in their
      neighbourhood. They do not confine their hospitalities to English people,
      either. I wonder who this M. de la Feste is, in whom Caroline says my
      mother is so much interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      July 18.-Another letter from Caroline. I have learnt from this epistle,
      that M. Charles de la Feste is 'only one of the many friends of the
      Marlets'; that though a Frenchman by birth, and now again temporarily at
      Versailles, he has lived in England many many years; that he is a talented
      landscape and marine painter, and has exhibited at the Salon, and I think
      in London. His style and subjects are considered somewhat peculiar in
      Paris-rather English than Continental. I have not as yet learnt his age,
      or his condition, married or single. From the tone and nature of her
      remarks about him he sometimes seems to be a middle-aged family man,
      sometimes quite the reverse. From his nomadic habits I should say the
      latter is the most likely. He has travelled and seen a great deal, she
      tells me, and knows more about English literature than she knows herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      July 21.-Letter from Caroline. Query: Is 'a friend of ours and the
      Marlets,' of whom she now anonymously and mysteriously speaks, the same
      personage as the 'M. de la Feste' of her former letters? He must be the
      same, I think, from his pursuits. If so, whence this sudden change of
      tone? . . . I have been lost in thought for at least a quarter of an hour
      since writing the preceding sentence. Suppose my dear sister is falling in
      love with this young man-there is no longer any doubt about his age; what
      a very awkward, risky thing for her! I do hope that my mother has an eye
      on these proceedings. But, then, poor mother never sees the drift of
      anything: she is in truth less of a mother to Caroline than I am. If I
      were there, how jealously I would watch him, and ascertain his designs!
    </p>
    <p>
      I am of a stronger nature than Caroline. How I have supported her in the
      past through her little troubles and great griefs! Is she agitated at the
      presence of this, to her, new and strange feeling? But I am assuming her
      to be desperately in love, when I have no proof of anything of the kind.
      He may be merely a casual friend, of whom I shall hear no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      July 24.-Then he is a bachelor, as I suspected. 'If M. de la Feste ever
      marries he will,' etc. So she writes. They are getting into close
      quarters, obviously. Also, 'Something to keep my hair smooth, which M. de
      la Feste told me he had found useful for the tips of his moustache.' Very
      naively related this; and with how much unconsciousness of the intimacy
      between them that the remark reveals! But my mother-what can she be doing?
      Does she know of this? And if so, why does she not allude to it in her
      letters to my father? . . . I have been to look at Caroline's pony, in
      obedience to her reiterated request that I would not miss a day in seeing
      that she was well cared for. Anxious as Caroline was about this pony of
      hers before starting, she now never mentioned the poor animal once in her
      letters. The image of her pet suffers from displacement.
    </p>
    <p>
      August 3.-Caroline's forgetfulness of her pony has naturally enough
      extended to me, her sister. It is ten days since she last wrote, and but
      for a note from my mother I should not know if she were dead or alive.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II.-NEWS INTERESTING AND SERIOUS
    </h2>
    <p>
      August 5.-A cloud of letters. A letter from Caroline, another from mother;
      also one from each to my father.
    </p>
    <p>
      The probability to which all the intelligence from my sister has pointed
      of late turns out to be a fact. There is an engagement, or almost an
      engagement, announced between my dear Caroline and M. de la Feste-to
      Caroline's sublime happiness, and my mother's entire satisfaction; as well
      as to that of the Marlets. They and my mother seem to know all about the
      young man-which is more than I do, though a little extended information
      about him, considering that I am Caroline's elder sister, would not have
      been amiss. I half feel with my father, who is much surprised, and, I am
      sure, not altogether satisfied, that he should not have been consulted at
      all before matters reached such a definite stage, though he is too amiable
      to say so openly. I don't quite say that a good thing should have been
      hindered for the sake of our opinion, if it is a good thing; but the
      announcement comes very suddenly. It must have been foreseen by my mother
      for some time that this upshot was probable, and Caroline might have told
      me more distinctly that M. de la Feste was her lover, instead of alluding
      so mysteriously to him as only a friend of the Marlets, and lately
      dropping his name altogether. My father, without exactly objecting to him
      as a Frenchman, 'wishes he were of English or some other reasonable
      nationality for one's son-in-law,' but I tell him that the demarcations of
      races, kingdoms, and creeds, are wearing down every day, that patriotism
      is a sort of vice, and that the character of the individual is all we need
      think about in this case. I wonder if, in the event of their marriage, he
      will continue to live at Versailles, or if he will come to England.
    </p>
    <p>
      August 7.-A supplemental letter from Caroline, answering, by anticipation,
      some of the aforesaid queries. She tells me that 'Charles,' though he
      makes Versailles his present home, is by no means bound by his profession
      to continue there; that he will live just where she wishes, provided it be
      not too far from some centre of thought, art, and civilization. My mother
      and herself both think that the marriage should not take place till next
      year. He exhibits landscapes and canal scenery every year, she says; so I
      suppose he is popular, and that his income is sufficient to keep them in
      comfort. If not, I do not see why my father could not settle something
      more on them than he had intended, and diminish by a little what he had
      proposed for me, whilst it was imagined that I should be the first to
      stand in need of such.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of engaging manner, attractive appearance, and virtuous character,' is
      the reply I receive from her in answer to my request for a personal
      description. That is vague enough, and I would rather have had one
      definite fact of complexion, voice, deed, or opinion. But of course she
      has no eye now for material qualities; she cannot see him as he is. She
      sees him irradiated with glories such as never appertained and never will
      appertain to any man, foreign, English, or Colonial. To think that
      Caroline, two years my junior, and so childlike as to be five years my
      junior in nature, should be engaged to be married before me. But that is
      what happens in families more often than we are apt to remember.
    </p>
    <p>
      August 16.-Interesting news to-day. Charles, she says, has pleaded that
      their marriage may just as well be this year as next; and he seems to have
      nearly converted my mother to the same way of thinking. I do not myself
      see any reason for delay, beyond the standing one of my father having as
      yet had no opportunity of forming an opinion upon the man, the time, or
      anything. However, he takes his lot very quietly, and they are coming home
      to talk the question over with us; Caroline having decided not to make any
      positive arrangements for this change of state till she has seen me.
      Subject to my own and my father's approval, she says, they are inclined to
      settle the date of the wedding for November, three months from the present
      time, that it shall take place here in the village, that I, of course,
      shall be bridesmaid, and many other particulars. She draws an artless
      picture of the probable effect upon the minds of the villagers of this
      romantic performance in the chancel of our old church, in which she is to
      be chief actor-the foreign gentleman dropping down like a god from the
      skies, picking her up, and triumphantly carrying her off. Her only grief
      will be separation from me, but this is to be assuaged by my going and
      staying with her for long months at a time. This simple prattle is very
      sweet to me, my dear sister, but I cannot help feeling sad at the occasion
      of it. In the nature of things it is obvious that I shall never be to you
      again what I hitherto have been: your guide, counsellor, and most familiar
      friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. de la Feste does certainly seem to be all that one could desire as
      protector to a sensitive fragile child like Caroline, and for that I am
      thankful. Still, I must remember that I see him as yet only through her
      eyes. For her sake I am intensely anxious to meet him, and scrutinise him
      through and through, and learn what the man is really made of who is to
      have such a treasure in his keeping. The engagement has certainly been
      formed a little precipitately; I quite agree with my father in that:
      still, good and happy marriages have been made in a hurry before now, and
      mother seems well satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      August 20.-A terrible announcement came this morning; and we are in deep
      trouble. I have been quite unable to steady my thoughts on anything to-
      day till now-half-past eleven at night-and I only attempt writing these
      notes because I am too restless to remain idle, and there is nothing but
      waiting and waiting left for me to do. Mother has been taken dangerously
      ill at Versailles: they were within a day or two of starting; but all
      thought of leaving must now be postponed, for she cannot possibly be moved
      in her present state. I don't like the sound of haemorrhage at all in a
      woman of her full habit, and Caroline and the Marlets have not exaggerated
      their accounts I am certain. On the receipt of the letter my father
      instantly decided to go to her, and I have been occupied all day in
      getting him off, for as he calculates on being absent several days, there
      have been many matters for him to arrange before setting out-the chief
      being to find some one who will do duty for him next Sunday-a quest of no
      small difficulty at such short notice; but at last poor old feeble Mr.
      Dugdale has agreed to attempt it, with Mr. Highman, the Scripture reader,
      to assist him in the lessons.
    </p>
    <p>
      I fain would have gone with my father to escape the irksome anxiety of
      awaiting her; but somebody had to stay, and I could best be spared. George
      has driven him to the station to meet the last train by which he will
      catch the midnight boat, and reach Havre some time in the morning. He
      hates the sea, and a night passage in particular. I hope he will get there
      without mishap of any kind; but I feel anxious for him, stay-at- home as
      he is, and unable to cope with any difficulty. Such an errand, too; the
      journey will be sad enough at best. I almost think I ought to have been
      the one to go to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      August 21.-I nearly fell asleep of heaviness of spirit last night over my
      writing. My father must have reached Paris by this time; and now here
      comes a letter . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      Later.-The letter was to express an earnest hope that my father had set
      out. My poor mother is sinking, they fear. What will become of Caroline?
      O, how I wish I could see mother; why could not both have gone?
    </p>
    <p>
      Later.-I get up from my chair, and walk from window to window, and then
      come and write a line. I cannot even divine how poor Caroline's marriage
      is to be carried out if mother dies. I pray that father may have got there
      in time to talk to her and receive some directions from her about Caroline
      and M. de la Feste-a man whom neither my father nor I have seen. I, who
      might be useful in this emergency, am doomed to stay here, waiting in
      suspense.
    </p>
    <p>
      August 23.-A letter from my father containing the sad news that my
      mother's spirit has flown. Poor little Caroline is heart-broken-she was
      always more my mother's pet than I was. It is some comfort to know that my
      father arrived in time to hear from her own lips her strongly expressed
      wish that Caroline's marriage should be solemnized as soon as possible. M.
      de la Feste seems to have been a great favourite of my dear mother's; and
      I suppose it now becomes almost a sacred duty of my father to accept him
      as a son-in-law without criticism.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III.-HER GLOOM LIGHTENS A LITTLE
    </h2>
    <p>
      September 10.-I have inserted nothing in my diary for more than a
      fortnight. Events have been altogether too sad for me to have the spirit
      to put them on paper. And yet there comes a time when the act of recording
      one's trouble is recognized as a welcome method of dwelling upon it . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      My dear mother has been brought home and buried here in the parish. It was
      not so much her own wish that this should be done as my father's, who
      particularly desired that she should lie in the family vault beside his
      first wife. I saw them side by side before the vault was closed-two women
      beloved by one man. As I stood, and Caroline by my side, I fell into a
      sort of dream, and had an odd fancy that Caroline and I might be also
      beloved of one, and lie like these together-an impossibility, of course,
      being sisters. When I awoke from my reverie Caroline took my hand and said
      it was time to leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      September 14.-The wedding is indefinitely postponed. Caroline is like a
      girl awakening in the middle of a somnambulistic experience, and does not
      realize where she is, or how she stands. She walks about silently, and I
      cannot tell her thoughts, as I used to do. It was her own doing to write
      to M. de la Feste and tell him that the wedding could not possibly take
      place this autumn as originally planned. There is something depressing in
      this long postponement if she is to marry him at all; and yet I do not see
      how it could be avoided.
    </p>
    <p>
      October 20.-I have had so much to occupy me in consoling Caroline that I
      have been continually overlooking my diary. Her life was much nearer to my
      mother's than mine was. She has never, as I, lived away from home long
      enough to become self-dependent, and hence in her first loss, and all that
      it involved, she drooped like a rain-beaten lily. But she is of a nature
      whose wounds soon heal, even though they may be deep, and the supreme
      poignancy of her sorrow has already passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father is of opinion that the wedding should not be delayed too long.
      While at Versailles he made the acquaintance of M. de la Feste, and though
      they had but a short and hurried communion with each other, he was much
      impressed by M. de la Feste's disposition and conduct, and is strongly in
      favour of his suit. It is odd that Caroline's betrothed should influence
      in his favour all who come near him. His portrait, which dear Caroline has
      shown me, exhibits him to be of a physique that partly accounts for this:
      but there must be something more than mere appearance, and it is probably
      some sort of glamour or fascinating power-the quality which prevented
      Caroline from describing him to me with any accuracy of detail. At the
      same time, I see from the photograph that his face and head are remarkably
      well formed; and though the contours of his mouth are hidden by his
      moustache, his arched brows show well the romantic disposition of a true
      lover and painter of Nature. I think that the owner of such a face as this
      must be tender and sympathetic and true.
    </p>
    <p>
      October 30.-As my sister's grief for her mother becomes more and more
      calmed, her love for M. de la Feste begins to reassume its former
      absorbing command of her. She thinks of him incessantly, and writes whole
      treatises to him by way of letters. Her blank disappointment at his
      announcement of his inability to pay us a visit quite so soon as he had
      promised, was quite tragic. I, too, am disappointed, for I wanted to see
      and estimate him. But having arranged to go to Holland to seize some
      aerial effects for his pictures, which are only to be obtained at this
      time of the autumn, he is obliged to postpone his journey this way, which
      is now to be made early in the new year. I think myself that he ought to
      have come at all sacrifices, considering Caroline's recent loss, the sad
      postponement of what she was looking forward to, and her single-minded
      affection for him. Still, who knows; his professional success is
      important. Moreover, she is cheerful, and hopeful, and the delay will soon
      be overpast.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV.-SHE BEHOLDS THE ATTRACTIVE STRANGER
    </h2>
    <p>
      February 16.-We have had such a dull life here all the winter that I have
      found nothing important enough to set down, and broke off my journal
      accordingly. I resume it now to make an entry on the subject of dear
      Caroline's future. It seems that she was too grieved, immediately after
      the loss of our mother, to answer definitely the question of M. de la
      Feste how long the postponement was to be; then, afterwards, it was agreed
      that the matter should be discussed on his autumn visit; but as he did not
      come, it has remained in abeyance till this week, when Caroline, with the
      greatest simplicity and confidence, has written to him without any further
      pressure on his part, and told him that she is quite ready to fix the
      time, and will do so as soon as he arrives to see her. She is a little
      frightened now, lest it should seem forward in her to have revived the
      subject of her own accord; but she may assume that his question has been
      waiting on for an answer ever since, and that she has, therefore, acted
      only within her promise. In truth, the secret at the bottom of it all is
      that she is somewhat saddened because he has not latterly reminded her of
      the pause in their affairs-that, in short, his original impatience to
      possess her is not now found to animate him so obviously. I suppose that
      he loves her as much as ever; indeed, I am sure he must do so, seeing how
      lovable she is. It is mostly thus with all men when women are out of their
      sight; they grow negligent. Caroline must have patience, and remember that
      a man of his genius has many and important calls upon his time. In justice
      to her I must add that she does remember it fairly well, and has as much
      patience as any girl ever had in the circumstances. He hopes to come at
      the beginning of April at latest. Well, when he comes we shall see him.
    </p>
    <p>
      April 5.-I think that what M. de la Feste writes is reasonable enough,
      though Caroline looks heart-sick about it. It is hardly worth while for
      him to cross all the way to England and back just now, while the sea is so
      turbulent, seeing that he will be obliged, in any event, to come in May,
      when he has to be in London for professional purposes, at which time he
      can take us easily on his way both coming and going. When Caroline becomes
      his wife she will be more practical, no doubt; but she is such a child as
      yet that there is no contenting her with reasons. However, the time will
      pass quickly, there being so much to do in preparing a trousseau for her,
      which must now be put in hand in order that we may have plenty of leisure
      to get it ready. On no account must Caroline be married in half-mourning;
      I am sure that mother, could she know, would not wish it, and it is odd
      that Caroline should be so intractably persistent on this point, when she
      is usually so yielding.
    </p>
    <p>
      April 30.-This month has flown on swallow's wings. We are in a great state
      of excitement-I as much as she-I cannot quite tell why. He is really
      coming in ten days, he says.
    </p>
    <p>
      May 9. Four p.m.-I am so agitated I can scarcely write, and yet am
      particularly impelled to do so before leaving my room. It is the
      unexpected shape of an expected event which has caused my absurd
      excitement, which proves me almost as much a school-girl as Caroline.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. de la Feste was not, as we understood, to have come till to-morrow; but
      he is here-just arrived. All household directions have devolved upon me,
      for my father, not thinking M. de la Feste would appear before us for
      another four-and-twenty hours, left home before post time to attend a
      distant consecration; and hence Caroline and I were in no small excitement
      when Charles's letter was opened, and we read that he had been
      unexpectedly favoured in the dispatch of his studio work, and would follow
      his letter in a few hours. We sent the covered carriage to meet the train
      indicated, and waited like two newly strung harps for the first sound of
      the returning wheels. At last we heard them on the gravel; and the
      question arose who was to receive him. It was, strictly speaking, my duty;
      but I felt timid; I could not help shirking it, and insisted that Caroline
      should go down. She did not, however, go near the door as she usually does
      when anybody is expected, but waited palpitating in the drawing-room. He
      little thought when he saw the silent hall, and the apparently deserted
      house, how that house was at the very same moment alive and throbbing with
      interest under the surface. I stood at the back of the upper landing,
      where nobody could see me from downstairs, and heard him walk across the
      hall-a lighter step than my father's-and heard him then go into the
      drawing-room, and the servant shut the door behind him and go away.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a pretty lover's meeting they must have had in there all to
      themselves! Caroline's sweet face looking up from her black gown-how it
      must have touched him. I know she wept very much, for I heard her; and her
      eyes will be red afterwards, and no wonder, poor dear, though she is no
      doubt happy. I can imagine what she is telling him while I write this-her
      fears lest anything should have happened to prevent his coming after
      all-gentle, smiling reproaches for his long delay; and things of that
      sort. His two portmanteaus are at this moment crossing the landing on the
      way to his room. I wonder if I ought to go down.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little later.-I have seen him! It was not at all in the way that I
      intended to encounter him, and I am vexed. Just after his portmanteaus
      were brought up I went out from my room to descend, when, at the moment of
      stepping towards the first stair, my eyes were caught by an object in the
      hall below, and I paused for an instant, till I saw that it was a bundle
      of canvas and sticks, composing a sketching tent and easel. At the same
      nick of time the drawing-room door opened and the affianced pair came out.
      They were saying they would go into the garden; and he waited a moment
      while she put on her hat. My idea was to let them pass on without seeing
      me, since they seemed not to want my company, but I had got too far on the
      landing to retreat; he looked up, and stood staring at me-engrossed to a
      dream-like fixity. Thereupon I, too, instead of advancing as I ought to
      have done, stood moonstruck and awkward, and before I could gather my weak
      senses sufficiently to descend, she had called him, and they went out by
      the garden door together. I then thought of following them, but have
      changed my mind, and come here to jot down these few lines. It is all I am
      fit for . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      He is even more handsome than I expected. I was right in feeling he must
      have an attraction beyond that of form: it appeared even in that momentary
      glance. How happy Caroline ought to be. But I must, of course, go down to
      be ready with tea in the drawing-room by the time they come indoors.
    </p>
    <p>
      11 p.m.-I have made the acquaintance of M. de la Feste; and I seem to be
      another woman from the effect of it. I cannot describe why this should be
      so, but conversation with him seems to expand the view, and open the
      heart, and raise one as upon stilts to wider prospects. He has a good
      intellectual forehead, perfect eyebrows, dark hair and eyes, an animated
      manner, and a persuasive voice. His voice is soft in quality-too soft for
      a man, perhaps; and yet on second thoughts I would not have it less so. We
      have been talking of his art: I had no notion that art demanded such
      sacrifices or such tender devotion; or that there were two roads for
      choice within its precincts, the road of vulgar money-making, and the road
      of high aims and consequent inappreciation for many long years by the
      public. That he has adopted the latter need not be said to those who
      understand him. It is a blessing for Caroline that she has been chosen by
      such a man, and she ought not to lament at postponements and delays, since
      they have arisen unavoidably. Whether he finds hers a sufficiently rich
      nature, intellectually and emotionally, for his own, I know not, but he
      seems occasionally to be disappointed at her simple views of things. Does
      he really feel such love for her at this moment as he no doubt believes
      himself to be feeling, and as he no doubt hopes to feel for the remainder
      of his life towards her?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a curious thing he told me when we were left for a few minutes
      alone; that Caroline had alluded so slightly to me in her conversation and
      letters that he had not realized my presence in the house here at all.
      But, of course, it was only natural that she should write and talk most
      about herself. I suppose it was on account of the fact of his being taken
      in some measure unawares, that I caught him on two or three occasions
      regarding me fixedly in a way that disquieted me somewhat, having been
      lately in so little society; till my glance aroused him from his reverie,
      and he looked elsewhere in some confusion. It was fortunate that he did
      so, and thus failed to notice my own. It shows that he, too, is not
      particularly a society person.
    </p>
    <p>
      May 10.-Have had another interesting conversation with M. de la Feste on
      schools of landscape painting in the drawing-room after dinner this
      evening-my father having fallen asleep, and left nobody but Caroline and
      myself for Charles to talk to. I did not mean to say so much to him, and
      had taken a volume of Modern Painters from the bookcase to occupy myself
      with, while leaving the two lovers to themselves; but he would include me
      in his audience, and I was obliged to lay the book aside. However, I
      insisted on keeping Caroline in the conversation, though her views on
      pictorial art were only too charmingly crude and primitive.
    </p>
    <p>
      To-morrow, if fine, we are all three going to Wherryborne Wood, where
      Charles will give us practical illustrations of the principles of coloring
      that he has enumerated to-night. I am determined not to occupy his
      attention to the exclusion of Caroline, and my plan is that when we are in
      the dense part of the wood I will lag behind, and slip away, and leave
      them to return by themselves. I suppose the reason of his attentiveness to
      me lies in his simply wishing to win the good opinion of one who is so
      closely united to Caroline, and so likely to influence her good opinion of
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      May 11. Late.-I cannot sleep, and in desperation have lit my candle and
      taken up my pen. My restlessness is occasioned by what has occurred to-
      day, which at first I did not mean to write down, or trust to any heart
      but my own. We went to Wherryborne Wood-Caroline, Charles and I, as we had
      intended-and walked all three along the green track through the midst,
      Charles in the middle between Caroline and myself. Presently I found that,
      as usual, he and I were the only talkers, Caroline amusing herself by
      observing birds and squirrels as she walked docilely alongside her
      betrothed. Having noticed this I dropped behind at the first opportunity
      and slipped among the trees, in a direction in which I knew I should find
      another path that would take me home. Upon this track I by and by emerged,
      and walked along it in silent thought till, at a bend, I suddenly
      encountered M. de la Feste standing stock still and smiling thoughtfully
      at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Where is Caroline?' said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Only a little way off,' says he. 'When we missed you from behind us we
      thought you might have mistaken the direction we had followed, so she has
      gone one way to find you and I have come this way.'
    </p>
    <p>
      We then went back to find Caroline, but could not discover her anywhere,
      and the upshot was that he and I were wandering about the woods alone for
      more than an hour. On reaching home we found she had given us up after
      searching a little while, and arrived there some time before. I should not
      be so disturbed by the incident if I had not perceived that, during her
      absence from us, he did not make any earnest effort to rediscover her; and
      in answer to my repeated expressions of wonder as to whither she could
      have wandered he only said, 'Oh, she's quite safe; she told me she knew
      the way home from any part of this wood. Let us go on with our talk. I
      assure you I value this privilege of being with one I so much admire more
      than you imagine;' and other things of that kind. I was so foolish as to
      show a little perturbation-I cannot tell why I did not control myself; and
      I think he noticed that I was not cool. Caroline has, with her simple good
      faith, thought nothing of the occurrence; yet altogether I am not
      satisfied.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V.-HER SITUATION IS A TRYING ONE
    </h2>
    <p>
      May 15.-The more I think of it day after day, the more convinced I am that
      my suspicions are true. He is too interested in me-well, in plain words,
      loves me; or, not to degrade that phrase, has a wild passion for me; and
      his affection for Caroline is that towards a sister only. That is the
      distressing truth; how it has come about I cannot tell, and it wears upon
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      A hundred little circumstances have revealed this to me, and the longer I
      dwell upon it the more agitating does the consideration become. Heaven
      only can help me out of the terrible difficulty in which this places me. I
      have done nothing to encourage him to be faithless to her. I have
      studiously kept out of his way; have persistently refused to be a third in
      their interviews. Yet all to no purpose. Some fatality has seemed to rule,
      ever since he came to the house, that this disastrous inversion of things
      should arise. If I had only foreseen the possibility of it before he
      arrived, how gladly would I have departed on some visit or other to the
      meanest friend to hinder such an apparent treachery. But I blindly
      welcomed him-indeed, made myself particularly agreeable to him for her
      sake.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no possibility of my suspicions being wrong; not until they have
      reached absolute certainty have I dared even to admit the truth to myself.
      His conduct to-day would have proved them true had I entertained no
      previous apprehensions. Some photographs of myself came for me by post,
      and they were handed round at the breakfast table and criticised. I put
      them temporarily on a side table, and did not remember them until an hour
      afterwards when I was in my own room. On going to fetch them I discovered
      him standing at the table with his back towards the door bending over the
      photographs, one of which he raised to his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      The witnessing this act so frightened me that I crept away to escape
      observation. It was the climax to a series of slight and significant
      actions all tending to the same conclusion. The question for me now is,
      what am I to do? To go away is what first occurs to me, but what reason
      can I give Caroline and my father for such a step; besides, it might
      precipitate some sort of catastrophe by driving Charles to desperation.
      For the present, therefore, I have decided that I can only wait, though
      his contiguity is strangely disturbing to me now, and I hardly retain
      strength of mind to encounter him. How will the distressing complication
      end?
    </p>
    <p>
      May 19.-And so it has come! My mere avoidance of him has precipitated the
      worst issue-a declaration. I had occasion to go into the kitchen garden to
      gather some of the double ragged-robins which grew in a corner there.
      Almost as soon as I had entered I heard footsteps without. The door opened
      and shut, and I turned to behold him just inside it. As the garden is
      closed by four walls and the gardener was absent, the spot ensured
      absolute privacy. He came along the path by the asparagus-bed, and
      overtook me.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You know why I come, Alicia?' said he, in a tremulous voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      I said nothing, and hung my head, for by his tone I did know.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' he went on, 'it is you I love; my sentiment towards your sister is
      one of affection too, but protective, tutelary affection-no more. Say what
      you will I cannot help it. I mistook my feeling for her, and I know how
      much I am to blame for my want of self-knowledge. I have fought against
      this discovery night and day; but it cannot be concealed. Why did I ever
      see you, since I could not see you till I had committed myself? At the
      moment my eyes beheld you on that day of my arrival, I said, "This is the
      woman for whom my manhood has waited." Ever since an unaccountable
      fascination has riveted my heart to you. Answer one word!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, M. de la Feste!' I burst out. What I said more I cannot remember, but
      I suppose that the misery I was in showed pretty plainly, for he said,
      'Something must be done to let her know; perhaps I have mistaken her
      affection, too; but all depends upon what you feel.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I cannot tell what I feel,' said I, 'except that this seems terrible
      treachery; and every moment that I stay with you here makes it worse! . .
      . Try to keep faith with her-her young heart is tender; believe me there
      is no mistake in the quality of her love for you. Would there were! This
      would kill her if she knew it!'
    </p>
    <p>
      He sighed heavily. 'She ought never to be my wife,' he said. 'Leaving my
      own happiness out of the question, it would be a cruelty to her to unite
      her to me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      I said I could not hear such words from him, and begged him in tears to go
      away; he obeyed, and I heard the garden door shut behind him. What is to
      be the end of the announcement, and the fate of Caroline?
    </p>
    <p>
      May 20.-I put a good deal on paper yesterday, and yet not all. I was, in
      truth, hoping against hope, against conviction, against too conscious
      self-judgment. I scarcely dare own the truth now, yet it relieves my
      aching heart to set it down. Yes, I love him-that is the dreadful fact,
      and I can no longer parry, evade, or deny it to myself though to the rest
      of the world it can never be owned. I love Caroline's betrothed, and he
      loves me. It is no yesterday's passion, cultivated by our converse; it
      came at first sight, independently of my will; and my talk with him
      yesterday made rather against it than for it, but, alas, did not quench
      it. God forgive us both for this terrible treachery.
    </p>
    <p>
      May 25.-All is vague; our courses shapeless. He comes and goes, being
      occupied, ostensibly at least, with sketching in his tent in the wood.
      Whether he and she see each other privately I cannot tell, but I rather
      think they do not; that she sadly awaits him, and he does not appear. Not
      a sign from him that my repulse has done him any good, or that he will
      endeavour to keep faith with her. O, if I only had the compulsion of a
      god, and the self-sacrifice of a martyr!
    </p>
    <p>
      May 31.-It has all ended-or rather this act of the sad drama has ended-in
      nothing. He has left us. No day for the fulfilment of the engagement with
      Caroline is named, my father not being the man to press any one on such a
      matter, or, indeed, to interfere in any way. We two girls are, in fact,
      quite defenceless in a case of this kind; lovers may come when they
      choose, and desert when they choose; poor father is too urbane to utter a
      word of remonstrance or inquiry. Moreover, as the approved of my dead
      mother, M. de la Feste has a sort of autocratic power with my father, who
      holds it unkind to her memory to have an opinion about him. I, feeling it
      my duty, asked M. de la Feste at the last moment about the engagement, in
      a voice I could not keep firm.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Since the death of your mother all has been indefinite-all!' he said
      gloomily. That was the whole. Possibly, Wherryborne Rectory may see him no
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      June 7 .-M. de la Feste has written-one letter to her, one to me. Hers
      could not have been very warm, for she did not brighten on reading it.
      Mine was an ordinary note of friendship, filling an ordinary sheet of
      paper, which I handed over to Caroline when I had finished looking it
      through. But there was a scrap of paper in the bottom of the envelope,
      which I dared not show any one. This scrap is his real letter: I scanned
      it alone in my room, trembling, hot and cold by turns. He tells me he is
      very wretched; that he deplores what has happened, but was helpless. Why
      did I let him see me, if only to make him faithless. Alas, alas!
    </p>
    <p>
      June 21 .-My dear Caroline has lost appetite, spirits, health. Hope
      deferred maketh the heart sick. His letters to her grow colder-if indeed
      he has written more than one. He has refrained from writing again to me-he
      knows it is no use. Altogether the situation that he and she and I are in
      is melancholy in the extreme. Why are human hearts so perverse?

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI.-HER INGENUITY INSTIGATES HER
    </h2>
    <p>
      September 19.-Three months of anxious care-till at length I have taken the
      extreme step of writing to him. Our chief distress has been caused by the
      state of poor Caroline, who, after sinking by degrees into such extreme
      weakness as to make it doubtful if she can ever recover full vigour, has
      to-day been taken much worse. Her position is very critical. The doctor
      says plainly that she is dying of a broken heart-and that even the removal
      of the cause may not now restore her. Ought I to have written to Charles
      sooner? But how could I when she forbade me? It was her pride only which
      instigated her, and I should not have obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sept. 26.-Charles has arrived and has seen her. He is shocked,
      conscience-stricken, remorseful. I have told him that he can do no good
      beyond cheering her by his presence. I do not know what he thinks of
      proposing to her if she gets better, but he says little to her at present:
      indeed he dares not: his words agitate her dangerously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sept. 28.-After a struggle between duty and selfishness, such as I pray to
      Heaven I may never have to undergo again, I have asked him for pity's sake
      to make her his wife, here and now, as she lies. I said to him that the
      poor child would not trouble him long; and such a solemnization would
      soothe her last hours as nothing else could do. He said that he would
      willingly do so, and had thought of it himself; but for one forbidding
      reason: in the event of her death as his wife he can never marry me, her
      sister, according to our laws. I started at his words. He went on: 'On the
      other hand, if I were sure that immediate marriage with me would save her
      life, I would not refuse, for possibly I might after a while, and out of
      sight of you, make myself fairly content with one of so sweet a
      disposition as hers; but if, as is probable, neither my marrying her nor
      any other act can avail to save her life, by so doing I lose both her and
      you.' I could not answer him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sept. 29.-He continued firm in his reasons for refusal till this morning,
      and then I became possessed with an idea, which I at once propounded to
      him. It was that he should at least consent to a form of marriage with
      Caroline, in consideration of her love; a form which need not be a legal
      union, but one which would satisfy her sick and enfeebled soul. Such
      things have been done, and the sentiment of feeling herself his would
      inexpressibly comfort her mind, I am sure. Then, if she is taken from us,
      I should not have lost the power of becoming his lawful wife at some
      future day, if it indeed should be deemed expedient; if, on the other
      hand, she lives, he can on her recovery inform her of the incompleteness
      of their marriage contract, the ceremony can be repeated, and I can, and I
      am sure willingly would, avoid troubling them with my presence till grey
      hairs and wrinkles make his unfortunate passion for me a thing of the
      past. I put all this before him; but he demurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sept. 30.-I have urged him again. He says he will consider. It is no time
      to mince matters, and as a further inducement I have offered to enter into
      a solemn engagement to marry him myself a year after her death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sept. 30. Later.-An agitating interview. He says he will agree to whatever
      I propose, the three possibilities and our contingent acts being recorded
      as follows: First, in the event of dear Caroline being taken from us, I
      marry him on the expiration of a year: Second, in the forlorn chance of
      her recovery I take upon myself the responsibility of explaining to
      Caroline the true nature of the ceremony he has gone through with her,
      that it was done at my suggestion to make her happy at once, before a
      special licence could be obtained, and that a public ceremony at church is
      awaiting her: Third, in the unlikely event of her cooling, and refusing to
      repeat the ceremony with him, I leave England, join him abroad, and there
      wed him, agreeing not to live in England again till Caroline has either
      married another or regards her attachment to Charles as a bygone matter. I
      have thought over these conditions, and have agreed to them all as they
      stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      11 p.m.-I do not much like this scheme, after all. For one thing, I have
      just sounded my father on it before parting with him for the night, my
      impression having been that he would see no objection. But he says he
      could on no account countenance any such unreal proceeding; however good
      our intentions, and even though the poor girl were dying, it would not be
      right. So I sadly seek my pillow.
    </p>
    <p>
      October 1.-I am sure my father is wrong in his view. Why is it not right,
      if it would be balm to Caroline's wounded soul, and if a real ceremony is
      absolutely refused by Charles-moreover is hardly practicable in the
      difficulty of getting a special licence, if he were agreed? My father does
      not know, or will not believe, that Caroline's attachment has been the
      cause of her hopeless condition. But that it is so, and that the form of
      words would give her inexpressible happiness, I know well; for I whispered
      tentatively in her ear on such marriages, and the effect was great.
      Henceforth my father cannot be taken into confidence on the subject of
      Caroline. He does not understand her.
    </p>
    <p>
      12 o'clock noon.-I have taken advantage of my father's absence to-day to
      confide my secret notion to a thoughtful young man, who called here this
      morning to speak to my father. He is the Mr. Theophilus Higham, of whom I
      have already had occasion to speak-a Scripture reader in the next town,
      and is soon going to be ordained. I told him the pitiable case, and my
      remedy. He says ardently that he will assist me-would do anything for me
      (he is, in truth, an admirer of mine); he sees no wrong in such an act of
      charity. He is coming again to the house this afternoon before my father
      returns, to carry out the idea. I have spoken to Charles, who promises to
      be ready. I must now break the news to Caroline.
    </p>
    <p>
      11 o'clock p.m.-I have been in too much excitement till now to set down
      the result. We have accomplished our plan; and though I feel like a guilty
      sinner, I am glad. My father, of course, is not to be informed as yet.
      Caroline has had a seraphic expression upon her wasted, transparent face
      ever since. I should hardly be surprised if it really saved her life even
      now, and rendered a legitimate union necessary between them. In that case
      my father can be informed of the whole proceeding, and in the face of such
      wonderful success cannot disapprove. Meanwhile poor Charles has not lost
      the possibility of taking unworthy me to fill her place should she-. But I
      cannot contemplate that alternative unmoved, and will not write it.
      Charles left for the South of Europe immediately after the ceremony. He
      was in a high-strung, throbbing, almost wild state of mind at first, but
      grew calmer under my exhortations. I had to pay the penalty of receiving a
      farewell kiss from him, which I much regret, considering its meaning; but
      he took me so unexpectedly, and in a moment was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oct. 6.-She certainly is better, and even when she found that Charles had
      been suddenly obliged to leave, she received the news quite cheerfully.
      The doctor says that her apparent improvement may be delusive; but I think
      our impressing upon her the necessity of keeping what has occurred a
      secret from papa, and everybody, helps to give her a zest for life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oct. 8.-She is still mending. I am glad to have saved her-my only
      sister-if I have done so; though I shall now never become Charles's wife.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII.-A SURPRISE AWAITS HER
    </h2>
    <p>
      Feb. 5.-Writing has been absolutely impossible for a long while; but I now
      reach a stage at which it seems possible to jot down a line. Caroline's
      recovery, extending over four months, has been very engrossing; at first
      slow, latterly rapid. But a fearful complication of affairs attends it!
    </p>
    <p>
      O what a tangled web we weave When first we practise to deceive!
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles has written reproachfully to me from Venice, where he is. He says
      how can he fulfil in the real what he has enacted in the counterfeit,
      while he still loves me? Yet how, on the other hand, can he leave it
      unfulfilled? All this time I have not told her, and up to this minute she
      believes that he has indeed taken her for better, for worse, till death
      them do part. It is a harassing position for me, and all three. In the
      awful approach of death, one's judgment loses its balance, and we do
      anything to meet the exigencies of the moment, with a single eye to the
      one who excites our sympathy, and from whom we seem on the brink of being
      separated for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had he really married her at that time all would be settled now. But he
      took too much thought; she might have died, and then he had his reason. If
      indeed it had turned out so, I should now be perhaps a sad woman; but not
      a tempest-tossed one . . . The possibility of his claiming me after all is
      what lies at the root of my agitation. Everything hangs by a thread.
      Suppose I tell her the marriage was a mockery; suppose she is indignant
      with me and with him for the deception-and then? Otherwise, suppose she is
      not indignant but forgives all; he is bound to marry her; and honour
      constrains me to urge him thereto, in spite of what he protests, and to
      smooth the way to this issue by my method of informing her. I have meant
      to tell her the last month-ever since she has been strong enough to bear
      such tidings; but I have been without the power-the moral force. Surely I
      must write, and get him to come and assist me.
    </p>
    <p>
      March 14.-She continually wonders why he does not come, the five months of
      his enforced absence having expired; and still more she wonders why he
      does not write oftener. His last letter was cold, she says, and she fears
      he regrets his marriage, which he may only have celebrated with her for
      pity's sake, thinking she was sure to die. It makes one's heart bleed to
      hear her hovering thus so near the truth, and yet never discerning its
      actual shape.
    </p>
    <p>
      A minor trouble besets me, too, in the person of the young Scripture
      reader, whose conscience pricks him for the part he played. Surely I am
      punished, if ever woman were, for a too ingenious perversion of her better
      judgment!
    </p>
    <p>
      April 2.-She is practically well. The faint pink revives in her cheek,
      though it is not quite so full as heretofore. But she still wonders what
      she can have done to offend 'her dear husband,' and I have been obliged to
      tell the smallest part of the truth-an unimportant fragment of the whole,
      in fact, I said that I feared for the moment he might regret the
      precipitancy of the act, which her illness caused, his affairs not having
      been quite sufficiently advanced for marriage just then, though he will
      doubtless come to her as soon as he has a home ready. Meanwhile I have
      written to him, peremptorily, to come and relieve me in this awful
      dilemma. He will find no note of love in that.
    </p>
    <p>
      April 10.-To my alarm the letter I lately addressed to him at Venice,
      where he is staying, as well as the last one she sent him, have received
      no reply. She thinks he is ill. I do not quite think that, but I wish we
      could hear from him. Perhaps the peremptoriness of my words had offended
      him; it grieves me to think it possible. I offend him! But too much of
      this. I must tell her the truth, or she may in her ignorance commit
      herself to some course or other that may be ruinously compromising. She
      said plaintively just now that if he could see her, and know how occupied
      with him and him alone is her every waking hour, she is sure he would
      forgive her the wicked presumption of becoming his wife. Very sweet all
      that, and touching. I could not conceal my tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      April 15.-The house is in confusion; my father is angry and distressed,
      and I am distracted. Caroline has disappeared-gone away secretly. I cannot
      help thinking that I know where she is gone to. How guilty I seem, and how
      innocent she! O that I had told her before now!
    </p>
    <p>
      1 o'clock.-No trace of her as yet. We find also that the little
      waiting-maid we have here in training has disappeared with Caroline, and
      there is not much doubt that Caroline, fearing to travel alone, has
      induced this girl to go with her as companion. I am almost sure she has
      started in desperation to find him, and that Venice is her goal. Why
      should she run away, if not to join her husband, as she thinks him? Now
      that I consider, there have been indications of this wish in her for days,
      as in birds of passage there lurk signs of their incipient intention; and
      yet I did not think she would have taken such an extreme step, unaided,
      and without consulting me. I can only jot down the bare facts-I have no
      time for reflections. But fancy Caroline travelling across the continent
      of Europe with a chit of a girl, who will be more of a charge than an
      assistance! They will be a mark for every marauder who encounters them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evening: 8 o'clock.-Yes, it is as I surmised. She has gone to join him. A
      note posted by her in Budmouth Regis at daybreak has reached me this
      afternoon-thanks to the fortunate chance of one of the servants calling
      for letters in town to-day, or I should not have got it until to-morrow.
      She merely asserts her determination of going to him, and has started
      privately, that nothing may hinder her; stating nothing about her route.
      That such a gentle thing should suddenly become so calmly resolute quite
      surprises me. Alas, he may have left Venice-she may not find him for
      weeks-may not at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father, on learning the facts, bade me at once have everything ready by
      nine this evening, in time to drive to the train that meets the night
      steam-boat. This I have done, and there being an hour to spare before we
      start, I relieve the suspense of waiting by taking up my pen. He says
      overtake her we must, and calls Charles the hardest of names. He believes,
      of course, that she is merely an infatuated girl rushing off to meet her
      lover; and how can the wretched I tell him that she is more, and in a
      sense better than that-yet not sufficiently more and better to make this
      flight to Charles anything but a still greater danger to her than a mere
      lover's impulse. We shall go by way of Paris, and we think we may overtake
      her there. I hear my father walking restlessly up and down the hall, and
      can write no more.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII.-SHE TRAVELS IN PURSUIT
    </h2>
    <p>
      April 16. Evening, Paris, Hotel &mdash;-.-There is no overtaking her at
      this place; but she has been here, as I thought, no other hotel in Paris
      being known to her. We go on to-morrow morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      April 18. Venice.-A morning of adventures and emotions which leave me sick
      and weary, and yet unable to sleep, though I have lain down on the sofa of
      my room for more than an hour in the attempt. I therefore make up my diary
      to date in a hurried fashion, for the sake of the riddance it affords to
      ideas which otherwise remain suspended hotly in the brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      We arrived here this morning in broad sunlight, which lit up the sea- girt
      buildings as we approached so that they seemed like a city of cork
      floating raft-like on the smooth, blue deep. But I only glanced from the
      carriage window at the lovely scene, and we were soon across the
      intervening water and inside the railway station. When we got to the front
      steps the row of black gondolas and the shouts of the gondoliers so
      bewildered my father that he was understood to require two gondolas
      instead of one with two oars, and so I found him in one and myself in
      another. We got this righted after a while, and were rowed at once to the
      hotel on the Riva degli Schiavoni where M. de la Feste had been staying
      when we last heard from him, the way being down the Grand Canal for some
      distance, under the Rialto, and then by narrow canals which eventually
      brought us under the Bridge of Sighs-harmonious to our moods!-and out
      again into open water. The scene was purity itself as to colour, but it
      was cruel that I should behold it for the first time under such
      circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as I entered the hotel, which is an old-fashioned place, like most
      places here, where people are taken en pension as well as the ordinary
      way, I rushed to the framed list of visitors hanging in the hall, and in a
      moment I saw Charles's name upon it among the rest. But she was our chief
      thought. I turned to the hall porter, and-knowing that she would have
      travelled as 'Madame de la Feste'-I asked for her under that name, without
      my father hearing. (He, poor soul, was making confused inquiries outside
      the door about 'an English lady,' as if there were not a score of English
      ladies at hand.)
    </p>
    <p>
      'She has just come,' said the porter. 'Madame came by the very early train
      this morning, when Monsieur was asleep, and she requested us not to
      disturb him. She is now in her room.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether Caroline had seen us from the window, or overheard me, I do not
      know, but at that moment I heard footsteps on the bare marble stairs, and
      she appeared in person descending.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Caroline!' I exclaimed, 'why have you done this?' and rushed up to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer; but looked down to hide her emotion, which she
      conquered after the lapse of a few seconds, putting on a practical tone
      that belied her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am just going to my husband,' she said. 'I have not yet seen him. I
      have not been here long.' She condescended to give no further reason for
      her movements, and made as if to move on. I implored her to come into a
      private room where I could speak to her in confidence, but she objected.
      However, the dining-room, close at hand, was quite empty at this hour, and
      I got her inside and closed the door. I do not know how I began my
      explanation, or how I ended it, but I told her briefly and brokenly enough
      that the marriage was not real.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not real?' she said vacantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is not,' said I. 'You will find that it is all as I say.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not believe my meaning even then. 'Not his wife?' she cried. 'It
      is impossible. What am I, then?'
    </p>
    <p>
      I added more details, and reiterated the reason for my conduct as well as
      I could; but Heaven knows how very difficult I found it to feel a jot more
      justification for it in my own mind than she did in hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The revulsion of feeling, as soon as she really comprehended all, was most
      distressing. After her grief had in some measure spent itself she turned
      against both him and me.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why should have I been deceived like this?' she demanded, with a bitter
      haughtiness of which I had not deemed such a tractable creature capable.
      'Do you suppose that anything could justify such an imposition? What, O
      what a snare you have spread for me!'
    </p>
    <p>
      I murmured, 'Your life seemed to require it,' but she did not hear me. She
      sank down in a chair, covered her face, and then my father came in. 'O,
      here you are!' he said. 'I could not find you. And Caroline!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And were you, papa, a party to this strange deed of kindness?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'To what?' said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then out it all came, and for the first time he was made acquainted with
      the fact that the scheme for soothing her illness, which I had sounded him
      upon, had been really carried out. In a moment he sided with Caroline. My
      repeated assurance that my motive was good availed less than nothing. In a
      minute or two Caroline arose and went abruptly out of the room, and my
      father followed her, leaving me alone to my reflections.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was so bent upon finding Charles immediately that I did not notice
      whither they went. The servants told me that M. de la Feste was just
      outside smoking, and one of them went to look for him, I following; but
      before we had gone many steps he came out of the hotel behind me. I
      expected him to be amazed; but he showed no surprise at seeing me, though
      he showed another kind of feeling to an extent which dismayed me. I may
      have revealed something similar; but I struggled hard against all emotion,
      and as soon as I could I told him she had come. He simply said 'Yes' in a
      low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You know it, Charles?' said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have just learnt it,' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, Charles,' I went on, 'having delayed completing your marriage with her
      till now, I fear-it has become a serious position for us. Why did you not
      reply to our letters?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I was purposing to reply in person: I did not know how to address her on
      the point-how to address you. But what has become of her?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She has gone off with my father,' said I; 'indignant with you, and
      scorning me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He was silent: and I suggested that we should follow them, pointing out
      the direction which I fancied their gondola had taken. As the one we got
      into was doubly manned we soon came in view of their two figures ahead of
      us, while they were not likely to observe us, our boat having the 'felze'
      on, while theirs was uncovered. They shot into a narrow canal just beyond
      the Giardino Reale, and by the time we were floating up between its slimy
      walls we saw them getting out of their gondola at the steps which lead up
      near the end of the Via 22 Marzo. When we reached the same spot they were
      walking up and down the Via in consultation. Getting out he stood on the
      lower steps watching them. I watched him. He seemed to fall into a
      reverie.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Will you not go and speak to her?' said I at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      He assented, and went forward. Still he did not hasten to join them, but,
      screened by a projecting window, observed their musing converse. At last
      he looked back at me; whereupon I pointed forward, and he in obedience
      stepped out, and met them face to face. Caroline flushed hot, bowed
      haughtily to him, turned away, and taking my father's arm violently, led
      him off before he had had time to use his own judgment. They disappeared
      into a narrow calle, or alley, leading to the back of the buildings on the
      Grand Canal.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. de la Feste came slowly back; as he stepped in beside me I realized my
      position so vividly that my heart might almost have been heard to beat.
      The third condition had arisen-the least expected by either of us. She had
      refused him; he was free to claim me.
    </p>
    <p>
      We returned in the boat together. He seemed quite absorbed till we had
      turned the angle into the Grand Canal, when he broke the silence. 'She
      spoke very bitterly to you in the salle-a-manger,' he said. 'I do not
      think she was quite warranted in speaking so to you, who had nursed her so
      tenderly.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, but I think she was,' I answered. 'It was there I told her what had
      been done; she did not know till then.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She was very dignified-very striking,' he murmured. 'You were more.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But how do you know what passed between us,' said I. He then told me that
      he had seen and heard all. The dining-room was divided by folding- doors
      from an inner portion, and he had been sitting in the latter part when we
      entered the outer, so that our words were distinctly audible.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But, dear Alicia,' he went on, 'I was more impressed by the affection of
      your apology to her than by anything else. And do you know that now the
      conditions have arisen which give me liberty to consider you my
      affianced?' I had been expecting this, but yet was not prepared. I
      stammered out that we would not discuss it then.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why not?' said he. 'Do you know that we may marry here and now? She has
      cast off both you and me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It cannot be,' said I, firmly. 'She has not been fairly asked to be your
      wife in fact-to repeat the service lawfully; and until that has been done
      it would be grievous sin in me to accept you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      I had not noticed where the gondoliers were rowing us. I suppose he had
      given them some direction unheard by me, for as I resigned myself in
      despairing indolence to the motion of the gondola, I perceived that it was
      taking us up the Canal, and, turning into a side opening near the Palazzo
      Grimani, drew up at some steps near the end of a large church.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Where are we?' said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is the Church of the Frari,' he replied. 'We might be married there.
      At any rate, let us go inside, and grow calm, and decide what to do.'
    </p>
    <p>
      When we had entered I found that whether a place to marry in or not, it
      was one to depress. The word which Venice speaks most constantly-decay-was
      in a sense accentuated here. The whole large fabric itself seemed sinking
      into an earth which was not solid enough to bear it. Cobwebbed cracks
      zigzagged the walls, and similar webs clouded the window-panes. A
      sickly-sweet smell pervaded the aisles. After walking about with him a
      little while in embarrassing silences, divided only by his cursory
      explanations of the monuments and other objects, and almost fearing he
      might produce a marriage licence, I went to a door in the south transept
      which opened into the sacristy.
    </p>
    <p>
      I glanced through it, towards the small altar at the upper end. The place
      was empty save of one figure; and she was kneeling here in front of the
      beautiful altarpiece by Bellini. Beautiful though it was she seemed not to
      see it. She was weeping and praying as though her heart was broken. She
      was my sister Caroline. I beckoned to Charles, and he came to my side, and
      looked through the door with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Speak to her,' said I. 'She will forgive you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      I gently pushed him through the doorway, and went back into the transept,
      down the nave, and onward to the west door. There I saw my father, to whom
      I spoke. He answered severely that, having first obtained comfortable
      quarters in a pension on the Grand Canal, he had gone back to the hotel on
      the Riva degli Schiavoni to find me; but that I was not there. He was now
      waiting for Caroline, to accompany her back to the pension, at which she
      had requested to be left to herself as much as possible till she could
      regain some composure.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told him that it was useless to dwell on what was past, that I no doubt
      had erred, that the remedy lay in the future and their marriage. In this
      he quite agreed with me, and on my informing him that M. de la Feste was
      at that moment with Caroline in the sacristy, he assented to my proposal
      that we should leave them to themselves, and return together to await them
      at the pension, where he had also engaged a room for me. This we did, and
      going up to the chamber he had chosen for me, which overlooked the Canal,
      I leant from the window to watch for the gondola that should contain
      Charles and my sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were not long in coming. I recognized them by the colour of her
      sunshade as soon as they turned the bend on my right hand. They were side
      by side of necessity, but there was no conversation between them, and I
      thought that she looked flushed and he pale. When they were rowed in to
      the steps of our house he handed her up. I fancied she might have refused
      his assistance, but she did not. Soon I heard her pass my door, and
      wishing to know the result of their interview I went downstairs, seeing
      that the gondola had not put off with him. He was turning from the door,
      but not towards the water, intending apparently to walk home by way of the
      calle which led into the Via 22 Marzo.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Has she forgiven you?' said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have not asked her,' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But you are bound to do so,' I told him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused, and then said, 'Alicia, let us understand each other. Do you
      mean to tell me, once for all, that if your sister is willing to become my
      wife you absolutely make way for her, and will not entertain any thought
      of what I suggested to you any more?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I do tell you so,' said I with dry lips. 'You belong to her-how can I do
      otherwise?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes; it is so; it is purely a question of honour,' he returned. 'Very
      well then, honour shall be my word, and not my love. I will put the
      question to her frankly; if she says yes, the marriage shall be. But not
      here. It shall be at your own house in England.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'When?' said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will accompany her there,' he replied, 'and it shall be within a week
      of her return. I have nothing to gain by delay. But I will not answer for
      the consequences.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What do you mean?' said I. He made no reply, went away, and I came back
      to my room.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX.-SHE WITNESSES THE END
    </h2>
    <p>
      April 20. Milan, 10.30 p.m.-We are thus far on our way homeward. I, being
      decidedly de trop, travel apart from the rest as much as I can. Having
      dined at the hotel here, I went out by myself; regardless of the
      proprieties, for I could not stay in. I walked at a leisurely pace along
      the Via Allesandro Manzoni till my eye was caught by the grand Galleria
      Vittorio Emanuele, and I entered under the high glass arcades till I
      reached the central octagon, where I sat down on one of a group of chairs
      placed there. Becoming accustomed to the stream of promenaders, I soon
      observed, seated on the chairs opposite, Caroline and Charles. This was
      the first occasion on which I had seen them en tete-a-tete since my
      conversation with him. She soon caught sight of me; averted her eyes;
      then, apparently abandoning herself to an impulse, she jumped up from her
      seat and came across to me. We had not spoken to each other since the
      meeting in Venice.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Alicia,' she said, sitting down by my side, 'Charles asks me to forgive
      you, and I do forgive you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      I pressed her hand, with tears in my eyes, and said, 'And do you forgive
      him?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' said she, shyly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And what's the result?' said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      'We are to be married directly we reach home.'
    </p>
    <p>
      This was almost the whole of our conversation; she walked home with me,
      Charles following a little way behind, though she kept turning her head,
      as if anxious that he should overtake us. 'Honour and not love' seemed to
      ring in my ears. So matters stand. Caroline is again happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      April 25.-We have reached home, Charles with us. Events are now moving in
      silent speed, almost with velocity, indeed; and I sometimes feel oppressed
      by the strange and preternatural ease which seems to accompany their flow.
      Charles is staying at the neighbouring town; he is only waiting for the
      marriage licence; when obtained he is to come here, be quietly married to
      her, and carry her off. It is rather resignation than content which sits
      on his face; but he has not spoken a word more to me on the burning
      subject, or deviated one hair's breadth from the course he laid down. They
      may be happy in time to come: I hope so. But I cannot shake off
      depression.
    </p>
    <p>
      May 6.-Eve of the wedding. Caroline is serenely happy, though not blithe.
      But there is nothing to excite anxiety about her. I wish I could say the
      same of him. He comes and goes like a ghost, and yet nobody seems to
      observe this strangeness in his mien.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not help being here for the ceremony; but my absence would have
      resulted in less disquiet on his part, I believe. However, I may be wrong
      in attributing causes: my father simply says that Charles and Caroline
      have as good a chance of being happy as other people. Well, to-morrow
      settles all.
    </p>
    <p>
      May 7.-They are married: we have just returned from church. Charles looked
      so pale this morning that my father asked him if he was ill. He said, 'No:
      only a slight headache;' and we started for the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no hitch or hindrance; and the thing is done.
    </p>
    <p>
      4 p.m.-They ought to have set out on their journey by this time; but there
      is an unaccountable delay. Charles went out half-an-hour ago, and has not
      yet returned. Caroline is waiting in the hall; but I am dreadfully afraid
      they will miss the train. I suppose the trifling hindrance is of no
      account; and yet I am full of misgivings . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      Sept. 14.-Four months have passed; only four months! It seems like years.
      Can it be that only seventeen weeks ago I set on this paper the fact of
      their marriage? I am now an aged woman by comparison!
    </p>
    <p>
      On that never to be forgotten day we waited and waited, and Charles did
      not return. At six o'clock, when poor little Caroline had gone back to her
      room in a state of suspense impossible to describe, a man who worked in
      the water-meadows came to the house and asked for my father. He had an
      interview with him in the study. My father then rang his bell, and sent
      for me. I went down; and I then learnt the fatal news. Charles was no
      more. The waterman had been going to shut down the hatches of a weir in
      the meads when he saw a hat on the edge of the pool below, floating round
      and round in the eddy, and looking into the pool saw something strange at
      the bottom. He knew what it meant, and lowering the hatches so that the
      water was still, could distinctly see the body. It is needless to write
      particulars that were in the newspapers at the time. Charles was brought
      to the house, but he was dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      We all feared for Caroline; and she suffered much; but strange to say, her
      suffering was purely of the nature of deep grief which found relief in
      sobbing and tears. It came out at the inquest that Charles had been
      accustomed to cross the meads to give an occasional half-crown to an old
      man who lived on the opposite hill, who had once been a landscape painter
      in an humble way till he lost his eyesight; and it was assumed that he had
      gone thither for the same purpose to-day, and to bid him farewell. On this
      information the coroner's jury found that his death had been caused by
      misadventure; and everybody believes to this hour that he was drowned
      while crossing the weir to relieve the old man. Except one: she believes
      in no accident. After the stunning effect of the first news, I thought it
      strange that he should have chosen to go on such an errand at the last
      moment, and to go personally, when there was so little time to spare,
      since any gift could have been so easily sent by another hand. Further
      reflection has convinced me that this step out of life was as much a part
      of the day's plan as was the wedding in the church hard by. They were the
      two halves of his complete intention when he gave me on the Grand Canal
      that assurance which I shall never forget: 'Very well, then; honour shall
      be my word, not love. If she says "Yes," the marriage shall be.'
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not know why I should have made this entry at this particular time;
      but it has occurred to me to do it-to complete, in a measure, that part of
      my desultory chronicle which relates to the love-story of my sister and
      Charles. She lives on meekly in her grief; and will probably outlive it;
      while I-but never mind me.

      CHAPTER X.-SHE ADDS A NOTE LONG AFTER
    </h2>
    <p>
      Five-years later.-I have lighted upon this old diary, which it has
      interested me to look over, containing, as it does, records of the time
      when life shone more warmly in my eye than it does now. I am impelled to
      add one sentence to round off its record of the past. About a year ago my
      sister Caroline, after a persistent wooing, accepted the hand and heart of
      Theophilus Higham, once the blushing young Scripture reader who assisted
      at the substitute for a marriage I planned, and now the fully- ordained
      curate of the next parish. His penitence for the part he played ended in
      love. We have all now made atonement for our sins against her: may she be
      deceived no more.

      THE GRAVE BY THE HANDPOST
    </h2>
    <p>
      I never pass through Chalk-Newton without turning to regard the
      neighbouring upland, at a point where a lane crosses the lone straight
      highway dividing this from the next parish; a sight which does not fail to
      recall the event that once happened there; and, though it may seem
      superfluous, at this date, to disinter more memories of village history,
      the whispers of that spot may claim to be preserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on a dark, yet mild and exceptionally dry evening at Christmas-
      time (according to the testimony of William Dewy of Mellstock, Michael
      Mail, and others), that the choir of Chalk-Newton-a large parish situate
      about half-way between the towns of Ivel and Casterbridge, and now a
      railway station-left their homes just before midnight to repeat their
      annual harmonies under the windows of the local population. The band of
      instrumentalists and singers was one of the largest in the county; and,
      unlike the smaller and finer Mellstock string-band, which eschewed all but
      the catgut, it included brass and reed performers at full Sunday services,
      and reached all across the west gallery.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this night there were two or three violins, two 'cellos, a tenor viol,
      double bass, hautboy, clarionets, serpent, and seven singers. It was,
      however, not the choir's labours, but what its members chanced to witness,
      that particularly marked the occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had pursued their rounds for many years without meeting with any
      incident of an unusual kind, but to-night, according to the assertions of
      several, there prevailed, to begin with, an exceptionally solemn and
      thoughtful mood among two or three of the oldest in the band, as if they
      were thinking they might be joined by the phantoms of dead friends who had
      been of their number in earlier years, and now were mute in the churchyard
      under flattening mounds-friends who had shown greater zest for melody in
      their time than was shown in this; or that some past voice of a
      semi-transparent figure might quaver from some bedroom-window its
      acknowledgment of their nocturnal greeting, instead of a familiar living
      neighbour. Whether this were fact or fancy, the younger members of the
      choir met together with their customary thoughtlessness and buoyancy. When
      they had gathered by the stone stump of the cross in the middle of the
      village, near the White Horse Inn, which they made their starting point,
      some one observed that they were full early, that it was not yet twelve
      o'clock. The local waits of those days mostly refrained from sounding a
      note before Christmas morning had astronomically arrived, and not caring
      to return to their beer, they decided to begin with some outlying cottages
      in Sidlinch Lane, where the people had no clocks, and would not know
      whether it were night or morning. In that direction they accordingly went;
      and as they ascended to higher ground their attention was attracted by a
      light beyond the houses, quite at the top of the lane.
    </p>
    <p>
      The road from Chalk-Newton to Broad Sidlinch is about two miles long and
      in the middle of its course, where it passes over the ridge dividing the
      two villages, it crosses at right angles, as has been stated, the lonely
      monotonous old highway known as Long Ash Lane, which runs, straight as a
      surveyor's line, many miles north and south of this spot, on the
      foundation of a Roman road, and has often been mentioned in these
      narratives. Though now quite deserted and grass-grown, at the beginning of
      the century it was well kept and frequented by traffic. The glimmering
      light appeared to come from the precise point where the roads intersected.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I think I know what that mid mean!' one of the group remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stood a few moments, discussing the probability of the light having
      origin in an event of which rumours had reached them, and resolved to go
      up the hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Approaching the high land their conjectures were strengthened. Long Ash
      Lane cut athwart them, right and left; and they saw that at the junction
      of the four ways, under the hand-post, a grave was dug, into which, as the
      choir drew nigh, a corpse had just been thrown by the four Sidlinch men
      employed for the purpose. The cart and horse which had brought the body
      thither stood silently by.
    </p>
    <p>
      The singers and musicians from Chalk-Newton halted, and looked on while
      the gravediggers shovelled in and trod down the earth, till, the hole
      being filled, the latter threw their spades into the cart, and prepared to
      depart.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who mid ye be a-burying there?' asked Lot Swanhills in a raised voice.
      'Not the sergeant?'
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sidlinch men had been so deeply engrossed in their task that they had
      not noticed the lanterns of the Chalk-Newton choir till now.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What-be you the Newton carol-singers?' returned the representatives of
      Sidlinch.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ay, sure. Can it be that it is old Sergeant Holway you've a-buried
      there?'
    </p>
    <p>
      ''Tis so. You've heard about it, then?'
    </p>
    <p>
      The choir knew no particulars-only that he had shot himself in his
      apple-closet on the previous Sunday. 'Nobody seem'th to know what 'a did
      it for, 'a b'lieve? Leastwise, we don't know at Chalk-Newton,' continued
      Lot.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O yes. It all came out at the inquest.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The singers drew close, and the Sidlinch men, pausing to rest after their
      labours, told the story. 'It was all owing to that son of his, poor old
      man. It broke his heart.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But the son is a soldier, surely; now with his regiment in the East
      Indies?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ay. And it have been rough with the army over there lately. 'Twas a pity
      his father persuaded him to go. But Luke shouldn't have twyted the
      sergeant o't, since 'a did it for the best.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The circumstances, in brief, were these: The sergeant who had come to this
      lamentable end, father of the young soldier who had gone with his regiment
      to the East, had been singularly comfortable in his military experiences,
      these having ended long before the outbreak of the great war with France.
      On his discharge, after duly serving his time, he had returned to his
      native village, and married, and taken kindly to domestic life. But the
      war in which England next involved herself had cost him many frettings
      that age and infirmity prevented him from being ever again an active unit
      of the army. When his only son grew to young manhood, and the question
      arose of his going out in life, the lad expressed his wish to be a
      mechanic. But his father advised enthusiastically for the army.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Trade is coming to nothing in these days,' he said. 'And if the war with
      the French lasts, as it will, trade will be still worse. The army,
      Luke-that's the thing for 'ee. 'Twas the making of me, and 'twill be the
      making of you. I hadn't half such a chance as you'll have in these
      splendid hotter times.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Luke demurred, for he was a home-keeping, peace-loving youth. But, putting
      respectful trust in his father's judgment, he at length gave way, and
      enlisted in the &mdash;-d Foot. In the course of a few weeks he was sent
      out to India to his regiment, which had distinguished itself in the East
      under General Wellesley.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Luke was unlucky. News came home indirectly that he lay sick out
      there; and then on one recent day when his father was out walking, the old
      man had received tidings that a letter awaited him at Casterbridge. The
      sergeant sent a special messenger the whole nine miles, and the letter was
      paid for and brought home; but though, as he had guessed, it came from
      Luke, its contents were of an unexpected tenor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter had been written during a time of deep depression. Luke said
      that his life was a burden and a slavery, and bitterly reproached his
      father for advising him to embark on a career for which he felt unsuited.
      He found himself suffering fatigues and illnesses without gaining glory,
      and engaged in a cause which he did not understand or appreciate. If it
      had not been for his father's bad advice he, Luke, would now have been
      working comfortably at a trade in the village that he had never wished to
      leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      After reading the letter the sergeant advanced a few steps till he was
      quite out of sight of everybody, and then sat down on the bank by the
      wayside.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he arose half-an-hour later he looked withered and broken, and from
      that day his natural spirits left him. Wounded to the quick by his son's
      sarcastic stings, he indulged in liquor more and more frequently. His wife
      had died some years before this date, and the sergeant lived alone in the
      house which had been hers. One morning in the December under notice the
      report of a gun had been heard on his premises, and on entering the
      neighbours found him in a dying state. He had shot himself with an old
      firelock that he used for scaring birds; and from what he had said the day
      before, and the arrangements he had made for his decease, there was no
      doubt that his end had been deliberately planned, as a consequence of the
      despondency into which he had been thrown by his son's letter. The
      coroner's jury returned a verdict of felo de se.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Here's his son's letter,' said one of the Sidlinch men. ''Twas found in
      his father's pocket. You can see by the state o't how many times he read
      it over. Howsomever, the Lord's will be done, since it must, whether or
      no.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The grave was filled up and levelled, no mound being shaped over it. The
      Sidlinch men then bade the Chalk-Newton choir good-night, and departed
      with the cart in which they had brought the sergeant's body to the hill.
      When their tread had died away from the ear, and the wind swept over the
      isolated grave with its customary siffle of indifference, Lot Swanhills
      turned and spoke to old Richard Toller, the hautboy player.
    </p>
    <p>
      ''Tis hard upon a man, and he a wold sojer, to serve en so, Richard. Not
      that the sergeant was ever in a battle bigger than would go into a
      half-acre paddock, that's true. Still, his soul ought to hae as good a
      chance as another man's, all the same, hey?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard replied that he was quite of the same opinion. 'What d'ye say to
      lifting up a carrel over his grave, as 'tis Christmas, and no hurry to
      begin down in parish, and 'twouldn't take up ten minutes, and not a soul
      up here to say us nay, or know anything about it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lot nodded assent. 'The man ought to hae his chances,' he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ye may as well spet upon his grave, for all the good we shall do en by
      what we lift up, now he's got so far,' said Notton, the clarionet man and
      professed sceptic of the choir. 'But I'm agreed if the rest be.'
    </p>
    <p>
      They thereupon placed themselves in a semicircle by the newly stirred
      earth, and roused the dull air with the well-known Number Sixteen of their
      collection, which Lot gave out as being the one he thought best suited to
      the occasion and the mood
    </p>
    <p>
      He comes' the pri'-soners to' re-lease', In Sa'-tan's bon'-dage held'.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Jown it-we've never played to a dead man afore,' said Ezra Cattstock,
      when, having concluded the last verse, they stood reflecting for a breath
      or two. 'But it do seem more merciful than to go away and leave en, as
      they t'other fellers have done.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now backalong to Newton, and by the time we get overright the pa'son's
      'twill be half after twelve,' said the leader.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had not, however, done more than gather up their instruments when the
      wind brought to their notice the noise of a vehicle rapidly driven up the
      same lane from Sidlinch which the gravediggers had lately retraced. To
      avoid being run over when moving on, they waited till the benighted
      traveller, whoever he might be, should pass them where they stood in the
      wider area of the Cross.
    </p>
    <p>
      In half a minute the light of the lanterns fell upon a hired fly, drawn by
      a steaming and jaded horse. It reached the hand-post, when a voice from
      the inside cried, 'Stop here!' The driver pulled rein. The carriage door
      was opened from within, and there leapt out a private soldier in the
      uniform of some line regiment. He looked around, and was apparently
      surprised to see the musicians standing there.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Have you buried a man here?' he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No. We bain't Sidlinch folk, thank God; we be Newton choir. Though a man
      is just buried here, that's true; and we've raised a carrel over the poor
      mortal's natomy. What-do my eyes see before me young Luke Holway, that
      went wi' his regiment to the East Indies, or do I see his spirit straight
      from the battlefield? Be you the son that wrote the letter-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't-don't ask me. The funeral is over, then?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'There wer no funeral, in a Christen manner of speaking. But's buried,
      sure enough. You must have met the men going back in the empty cart.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Like a dog in a ditch, and all through me!'
    </p>
    <p>
      He remained silent, looking at the grave, and they could not help pitying
      him. 'My friends,' he said, 'I understand better now. You have, I suppose,
      in neighbourly charity, sung peace to his soul? I thank you, from my
      heart, for your kind pity. Yes; I am Sergeant Holway's miserable son-I'm
      the son who has brought about his father's death, as truly as if I had
      done it with my own hand!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, no. Don't ye take on so, young man. He'd been naturally low for a
      good while, off and on, so we hear.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'We were out in the East when I wrote to him. Everything had seemed to go
      wrong with me. Just after my letter had gone we were ordered home. That's
      how it is you see me here. As soon as we got into barracks at Casterbridge
      I heard o' this . . . Damn me! I'll dare to follow my father, and make
      away with myself, too. It is the only thing left to do!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't ye be rash, Luke Holway, I say again; but try to make amends by
      your future life. And maybe your father will smile a smile down from
      heaven upon 'ee for 't.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head. 'I don't know about that!' he answered bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Try and be worthy of your father at his best. 'Tis not too late.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'D'ye think not? I fancy it is! . . . Well, I'll turn it over. Thank you
      for your good counsel. I'll live for one thing, at any rate. I'll move
      father's body to a decent Christian churchyard, if I do it with my own
      hands. I can't save his life, but I can give him an honourable grave. He
      shan't lie in this accursed place!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ay, as our pa'son says, 'tis a barbarous custom they keep up at Sidlinch,
      and ought to be done away wi'. The man a' old soldier, too. You see, our
      pa'son is not like yours at Sidlinch.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He says it is barbarous, does he? So it is!' cried the soldier. 'Now
      hearken, my friends.' Then he proceeded to inquire if they would increase
      his indebtedness to them by undertaking the removal, privately, of the
      body of the suicide to the churchyard, not of Sidlinch, a parish he now
      hated, but of Chalk-Newton. He would give them all he possessed to do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lot asked Ezra Cattstock what he thought of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cattstock, the 'cello player, who was also the sexton, demurred, and
      advised the young soldier to sound the rector about it first. 'Mid be he
      would object, and yet 'a mid'nt. The pa'son o' Sidlinch is a hard man, I
      own ye, and 'a said if folk will kill theirselves in hot blood they must
      take the consequences. But ours don't think like that at all, and might
      allow it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What's his name?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The honourable and reverent Mr. Oldham, brother to Lord Wessex. But you
      needn't be afeard o' en on that account. He'll talk to 'ee like a common
      man, if so be you haven't had enough drink to gie 'ee bad breath.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, the same as formerly. I'll ask him. Thank you. And that duty done-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What then?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'There's war in Spain. I hear our next move is there. I'll try to show
      myself to be what my father wished me. I don't suppose I shall-but I'll
      try in my feeble way. That much I swear-here over his body. So help me
      God.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Luke smacked his palm against the white hand-post with such force that it
      shook. 'Yes, there's war in Spain; and another chance for me to be worthy
      of father.'
    </p>
    <p>
      So the matter ended that night. That the private acted in one thing as he
      had vowed to do soon became apparent, for during the Christmas week the
      rector came into the churchyard when Cattstock was there, and asked him to
      find a spot that would be suitable for the purpose of such an interment,
      adding that he had slightly known the late sergeant, and was not aware of
      any law which forbade him to assent to the removal, the letter of the rule
      having been observed. But as he did not wish to seem moved by opposition
      to his neighbour at Sidlinch, he had stipulated that the act of charity
      should be carried out at night, and as privately as possible, and that the
      grave should be in an obscure part of the enclosure. 'You had better see
      the young man about it at once,' added the rector.
    </p>
    <p>
      But before Ezra had done anything Luke came down to his house. His
      furlough had been cut short, owing to new developments of the war in the
      Peninsula, and being obliged to go back to his regiment immediately, he
      was compelled to leave the exhumation and reinterment to his friends.
      Everything was paid for, and he implored them all to see it carried out
      forthwith.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this the soldier left. The next day Ezra, on thinking the matter
      over, again went across to the rectory, struck with sudden misgiving. He
      had remembered that the sergeant had been buried without a coffin, and he
      was not sure that a stake had not been driven through him. The business
      would be more troublesome than they had at first supposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, indeed!' murmured the rector. 'I am afraid it is not feasible after
      all.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The next event was the arrival of a headstone by carrier from the nearest
      town; to be left at Mr. Ezra Cattstock's; all expenses paid. The sexton
      and the carrier deposited the stone in the former's outhouse; and Ezra,
      left alone, put on his spectacles and read the brief and simple
      inscription:-
    </p>
    <p>
      HERE LYETH THE BODY OF SAMUEL HOLWAY, LATE SERGEANT IN HIS MAJESTY'S
      &mdash;- D REGIMENT OF FOOT, WHO DEPARTED THIS LIFE DECEMBER THE 20TH,
      180-. ERECTED BY L. H. 'I AM NOT WORTHY TO BE CALLED THY SON.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Ezra again called at the riverside rectory. 'The stone is come, sir. But
      I'm afeard we can't do it nohow.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I should like to oblige him,' said the gentlemanly old incumbent. 'And I
      would forego all fees willingly. Still, if you and the others don't think
      you can carry it out, I am in doubt what to say.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, sir; I've made inquiry of a Sidlinch woman as to his burial, and
      what I thought seems true. They buried en wi' a new six-foot hurdle- saul
      drough's body, from the sheep-pen up in North Ewelease though they won't
      own to it now. And the question is, Is the moving worth while, considering
      the awkwardness?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Have you heard anything more of the young man?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Ezra had only heard that he had embarked that week for Spain with the rest
      of the regiment. 'And if he's as desperate as 'a seemed, we shall never
      see him here in England again.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is an awkward case,' said the rector.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ezra talked it over with the choir; one of whom suggested that the stone
      might be erected at the crossroads. This was regarded as impracticable.
      Another said that it might be set up in the churchyard without removing
      the body; but this was seen to be dishonest. So nothing was done.
    </p>
    <p>
      The headstone remained in Ezra's outhouse till, growing tired of seeing it
      there, he put it away among the bushes at the bottom of his garden. The
      subject was sometimes revived among them, but it always ended with:
      'Considering how 'a was buried, we can hardly make a job o't.'
    </p>
    <p>
      There was always the consciousness that Luke would never come back, an
      impression strengthened by the disasters which were rumoured to have
      befallen the army in Spain. This tended to make their inertness permanent.
      The headstone grew green as it lay on its back under Ezra's bushes; then a
      tree by the river was blown down, and, falling across the stone, cracked
      it in three pieces. Ultimately the pieces became buried in the leaves and
      mould.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luke had not been born a Chalk-Newton man, and he had no relations left in
      Sidlinch, so that no tidings of him reached either village throughout the
      war. But after Waterloo and the fall of Napoleon there arrived at Sidlinch
      one day an English sergeant-major covered with stripes and, as it turned
      out, rich in glory. Foreign service had so totally changed Luke Holway
      that it was not until he told his name that the inhabitants recognized him
      as the sergeant's only son.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had served with unswerving effectiveness through the Peninsular
      campaigns under Wellington; had fought at Busaco, Fuentes d'Onore, Ciudad
      Rodrigo, Badajoz, Salamanca, Vittoria, Quatre Bras, and Waterloo; and had
      now returned to enjoy a more than earned pension and repose in his native
      district.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hardly stayed in Sidlinch longer than to take a meal on his arrival.
      The same evening he started on foot over the hill to Chalk-Newton, passing
      the hand-post, and saying as he glanced at the spot, 'Thank God: he's not
      there!' Nightfall was approaching when he reached the latter village; but
      he made straight for the churchyard. On his entering it there remained
      light enough to discern the headstones by, and these he narrowly scanned.
      But though he searched the front part by the road, and the back part by
      the river, what he sought he could not find-the grave of Sergeant Holway,
      and a memorial bearing the inscription: 'I AM NOT WORTHY TO BE CALLED THY
      SON.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He left the churchyard and made inquiries. The honourable and reverend old
      rector was dead, and so were many of the choir; but by degrees the
      sergeant-major learnt that his father still lay at the cross-roads in Long
      Ash Lane.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luke pursued his way moodily homewards, to do which, in the natural
      course, he would be compelled to repass the spot, there being no other
      road between the two villages. But he could not now go by that place,
      vociferous with reproaches in his father's tones; and he got over the
      hedge and wandered deviously through the ploughed fields to avoid the
      scene. Through many a fight and fatigue Luke had been sustained by the
      thought that he was restoring the family honour and making noble amends.
      Yet his father lay still in degradation. It was rather a sentiment than a
      fact that his father's body had been made to suffer for his own misdeeds;
      but to his super-sensitiveness it seemed that his efforts to retrieve his
      character and to propitiate the shade of the insulted one had ended in
      failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      He endeavoured, however, to shake off his lethargy, and, not liking the
      associations of Sidlinch, hired a small cottage at Chalk-Newton which had
      long been empty. Here he lived alone, becoming quite a hermit, and
      allowing no woman to enter the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Christmas after taking up his abode herein he was sitting in the
      chimney corner by himself, when he heard faint notes in the distance, and
      soon a melody burst forth immediately outside his own window, it came from
      the carol-singers, as usual; and though many of the old hands, Ezra and
      Lot included, had gone to their rest, the same old carols were still
      played out of the same old books. There resounded through the
      sergeant-major's window-shutters the familiar lines that the deceased
      choir had rendered over his father's grave:-
    </p>
    <p>
      He comes' the pri'-soners to' re-lease', In Sa'-tan's bon'-dage held'.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had finished they went on to another house, leaving him to
      silence and loneliness as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The candle wanted snuffing, but he did not snuff it, and he sat on till it
      had burnt down into the socket and made waves of shadow on the ceiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Christmas cheerfulness of next morning was broken at breakfast-time by
      tragic intelligence which went down the village like wind. Sergeant- Major
      Holway had been found shot through the head by his own hand at the
      cross-roads in Long Ash Lane where his father lay buried.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the table in the cottage he had left a piece of paper, on which he had
      written his wish that he might be buried at the Cross beside his father.
      But the paper was accidentally swept to the floor, and overlooked till
      after his funeral, which took place in the ordinary way in the churchyard.
    </p>

    <h2>
      ENTER A DRAGOON
    </h2>
    <p>
      I lately had a melancholy experience (said the gentleman who is answerable
      for the truth of this story). It was that of going over a doomed house
      with whose outside aspect I had long been familiar-a house, that is, which
      by reason of age and dilapidation was to be pulled down during the
      following week. Some of the thatch, brown and rotten as the gills of old
      mushrooms, had, indeed, been removed before I walked over the building.
      Seeing that it was only a very small house-which is usually called a
      'cottage-residence'-situated in a remote hamlet, and that it was not more
      than a hundred years old, if so much, I was led to think in my progress
      through the hollow rooms, with their cracked walls and sloping floors,
      what an exceptional number of abrupt family incidents had taken place
      therein-to reckon only those which had come to my own knowledge. And no
      doubt there were many more of which I had never heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      It stood at the top of a garden stretching down to the lane or street that
      ran through a hermit-group of dwellings in Mellstock parish. From a green
      gate at the lower entrance, over which the thorn hedge had been shaped to
      an arch by constant clippings, a gravel path ascended between the box
      edges of once trim raspberry, strawberry, and vegetable plots, towards the
      front door. This was in colour an ancient and bleached green that could be
      rubbed off with the finger, and it bore a small long-featured brass
      knocker covered with verdigris in its crevices. For some years before this
      eve of demolition the homestead had degenerated, and been divided into two
      tenements to serve as cottages for farm labourers; but in its prime it had
      indisputable claim to be considered neat, pretty, and genteel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The variety of incidents above alluded to was mainly owing to the nature
      of the tenure, whereby the place had been occupied by families not quite
      of the kind customary in such spots-people whose circumstances, position,
      or antecedents were more or less of a critical happy-go-lucky cast. And of
      these residents the family whose term comprised the story I wish to relate
      was that of Mr. Jacob Paddock the market-gardener, who dwelt there for
      some years with his wife and grown-up daughter. I
    </p>
    <p>
      An evident commotion was agitating the premises, which jerked busy sounds
      across the front plot, resembling those of a disturbed hive. If a member
      of the household appeared at the door it was with a countenance of
      abstraction and concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evening began to bend over the scene; and the other inhabitants of the
      hamlet came out to draw water, their common well being in the public road
      opposite the garden and house of the Paddocks. Having wound up their
      bucketsfull respectively they lingered, and spoke significantly together.
      From their words any casual listener might have gathered information of
      what had occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woodman who lived nearest the site of the story told most of the tale.
      Selina, the daughter of the Paddocks opposite, had been surprised that
      afternoon by receiving a letter from her once intended husband, then a
      corporal, but now a sergeant-major of dragoons, whom she had hitherto
      supposed to be one of the slain in the Battle of the Alma two or three
      years before.
    </p>
    <p>
      'She picked up wi'en against her father's wish, as we know, and before he
      got his stripes,' their informant continued. 'Not but that the man was as
      hearty a feller as you'd meet this side o' London. But Jacob, you see,
      wished her to do better, and one can understand it. However, she was
      determined to stick to him at that time; and for what happened she was not
      much to blame, so near as they were to matrimony when the war broke out
      and spoiled all.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Even the very pig had been killed for the wedding,' said a woman, 'and
      the barrel o' beer ordered in. O, the man meant honourable enough. But to
      be off in two days to fight in a foreign country-'twas natural of her
      father to say they should wait till he got back.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And he never came,' murmured one in the shade.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The war ended but her man never turned up again. She was not sure he was
      killed, but was too proud, or too timid, to go and hunt for him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'One reason why her father forgave her when he found out how matters stood
      was, as he said plain at the time, that he liked the man, and could see
      that he meant to act straight. So the old folks made the best of what they
      couldn't mend, and kept her there with 'em, when some wouldn't. Time has
      proved seemingly that he did mean to act straight, now that he has writ to
      her that he's coming. She'd have stuck to him all through the time, 'tis
      my belief; if t'other hadn't come along.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'At the time of the courtship,' resumed the woodman, 'the regiment was
      quartered in Casterbridge Barracks, and he and she got acquainted by his
      calling to buy a penn'orth of rathe-ripes off that tree yonder in her
      father's orchard-though 'twas said he seed her over hedge as well as the
      apples. He declared 'twas a kind of apple he much fancied; and he called
      for a penn'orth every day till the tree was cleared. It ended in his
      calling for her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      ''Twas a thousand pities they didn't jine up at once and ha' done wi' it.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well; better late than never, if so be he'll have her now. But, Lord,
      she'd that faith in 'en that she'd no more belief that he was alive, when
      a' didn't come, than that the undermost man in our churchyard was alive.
      She'd never have thought of another but for that-O no!'
    </p>
    <p>
      ''Tis awkward, altogether, for her now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Still she hadn't married wi' the new man. Though to be sure she would
      have committed it next week, even the licence being got, they say, for
      she'd have no banns this time, the first being so unfortunate.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Perhaps the sergeant-major will think he's released, and go as he came.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, not as I reckon. Soldiers bain't particular, and she's a tidy piece o'
      furniture still. What will happen is that she'll have her soldier, and
      break off with the master-wheelwright, licence or no-daze me if she
      won't.'
    </p>
    <p>
      In the progress of these desultory conjectures the form of another
      neighbour arose in the gloom. She nodded to the people at the well, who
      replied 'G'd night, Mrs. Stone,' as she passed through Mr. Paddock's gate
      towards his door. She was an intimate friend of the latter's household,
      and the group followed her with their eyes up the path and past the
      windows, which were now lighted up by candles inside. II
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Stone paused at the door, knocked, and was admitted by Selina's
      mother, who took her visitor at once into the parlour on the left hand,
      where a table was partly spread for supper. On the 'beaufet' against the
      wall stood probably the only object which would have attracted the eye of
      a local stranger in an otherwise ordinarily furnished room, a great
      plum-cake guarded as if it were a curiosity by a glass shade of the kind
      seen in museums-square, with a wooden back like those enclosing stuffed
      specimens of rare feather or fur. This was the mummy of the cake intended
      in earlier days for the wedding-feast of Selina and the soldier, which had
      been religiously and lovingly preserved by the former as a testimony to
      her intentional respectability in spite of an untoward subsequent
      circumstance, which will be mentioned. This relic was now as dry as a
      brick, and seemed to belong to a pre-existent civilization. Till quite
      recently, Selina had been in the habit of pausing before it daily, and
      recalling the accident whose consequences had thrown a shadow over her
      life ever since-that of which the water-drawers had spoken-the sudden news
      one morning that the Route had come for the &mdash;-th Dragoons, two days
      only being the interval before departure; the hurried consultation as to
      what should be done, the second time of asking being past but not the
      third; and the decision that it would be unwise to solemnize matrimony in
      such haphazard circumstances, even if it were possible, which was
      doubtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the fire the young woman in question was now seated on a low stool,
      in the stillness of reverie, and a toddling boy played about the floor
      around her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, Mrs. Stone!' said Selina, rising slowly. 'How kind of you to come in.
      You'll bide to supper? Mother has told you the strange news, of course?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No. But I heard it outside, that is, that you'd had a letter from Mr.
      Clark-Sergeant-Major Clark, as they say he is now-and that he's coming to
      make it up with 'ee.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes; coming to-night-all the way from the north of England where he's
      quartered. I don't know whether I'm happy or-frightened at it. Of course I
      always believed that if he was alive he'd come and keep his solemn vow to
      me. But when it is printed that a man is killed-what can you think?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It was printed?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, yes. After the Battle of the Alma the book of the names of the
      killed and wounded was nailed up against Casterbridge Town Hall door.
      'Twas on a Saturday, and I walked there o' purpose to read and see for
      myself; for I'd heard that his name was down. There was a crowd of people
      round the book, looking for the names of relations; and I can mind that
      when they saw me they made way for me-knowing that we'd been just going to
      be married-and that, as you may say, I belonged to him. Well, I reached up
      my arm, and turned over the farrels of the book, and under the "killed" I
      read his surname, but instead of "John" they'd printed "James," and I
      thought 'twas a mistake, and that it must be he. Who could have guessed
      there were two nearly of one name in one regiment.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well-he's coming to finish the wedding of 'ee as may be said; so never
      mind, my dear. All's well that ends well.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's what he seems to say. But then he has not heard yet about Mr.
      Miller; and that's what rather terrifies me. Luckily my marriage with him
      next week was to have been by licence, and not banns, as in John's case;
      and it was not so well known on that account. Still, I don't know what to
      think.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Everything seems to come just 'twixt cup and lip with 'ee, don't it now,
      Miss Paddock. Two weddings broke off-'tis odd! How came you to accept Mr.
      Miller, my dear?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He's been so good and faithful! Not minding about the child at all; for
      he knew the rights of the story. He's dearly fond o' Johnny, you know-just
      as if 'twere his own-isn't he, my duck? Do Mr. Miller love you or don't
      he?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Iss! An' I love Mr. Miller,' said the toddler.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, you see, Mrs. Stone, he said he'd make me a comfortable home; and
      thinking 'twould be a good thing for Johnny, Mr. Miller being so much
      better off than me, I agreed at last, just as a widow might-which is what
      I have always felt myself; ever since I saw what I thought was John's name
      printed there. I hope John will forgive me!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'So he will forgive 'ee, since 'twas no manner of wrong to him. He ought
      to have sent 'ee a line, saying 'twas another man.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Selina's mother entered. 'We've not known of this an hour, Mrs. Stone,'
      she said. 'The letter was brought up from Lower Mellstock Post-office by
      one of the school children, only this afternoon. Mr. Miller was coming
      here this very night to settle about the wedding doings. Hark! Is that
      your father? Or is it Mr. Miller already come?'
    </p>
    <p>
      The footsteps entered the porch; there was a brushing on the mat, and the
      door of the room sprung back to disclose a rubicund man about thirty years
      of age, of thriving master-mechanic appearance and obviously comfortable
      temper. On seeing the child, and before taking any notice whatever of the
      elders, the comer made a noise like the crowing of a cock and flapped his
      arms as if they were wings, a method of entry which had the unqualified
      admiration of Johnny.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes-it is he,' said Selina constrainedly advancing.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What-were you all talking about me, my dear?' said the genial young man
      when he had finished his crowing and resumed human manners. 'Why what's
      the matter,' he went on. 'You look struck all of a heap.' Mr. Miller
      spread an aspect of concern over his own face, and drew a chair up to the
      fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O mother, would you tell Mr. Miller, if he don't know?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mister Miller! and going to be married in six days!' he interposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah-he don't know it yet!' murmured Mrs. Paddock.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Know what?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well-John Clark-now Sergeant-Major Clark-wasn't shot at Alma after all.
      'Twas another of almost the same name.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now that's interesting! There were several cases like that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And he's home again; and he's coming here to-night to see her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Whatever shall I say, that he may not be offended with what I've done?'
      interposed Selina.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But why should it matter if he be?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O! I must agree to be his wife if he forgives me-of course I must.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Must! But why not say nay, Selina, even if he do forgive 'ee?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no! How can I without being wicked? You were very very kind, Mr.
      Miller, to ask me to have you; no other man would have done it after what
      had happened; and I agreed, even though I did not feel half so warm as I
      ought. Yet it was entirely owing to my believing him in the grave, as I
      knew that if he were not he would carry out his promise; and this shows
      that I was right in trusting him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes . . . He must be a goodish sort of fellow,' said Mr. Miller, for a
      moment so impressed with the excellently faithful conduct of the
      sergeant-major of dragoons that he disregarded its effect upon his own
      position. He sighed slowly and added, 'Well, Selina, 'tis for you to say.
      I love you, and I love the boy; and there's my chimney-corner and sticks
      o' furniture ready for 'ee both.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, I know! But I mustn't hear it any more now,' murmured Selina
      quickly. 'John will be here soon. I hope he'll see how it all was when I
      tell him. If so be I could have written it to him it would have been
      better.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You think he doesn't know a single word about our having been on the
      brink o't. But perhaps it's the other way-he's heard of it and that may
      have brought him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah-perhaps he has!' she said brightening. 'And already forgives me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If not, speak out straight and fair, and tell him exactly how it fell
      out. If he's a man he'll see it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O he's a man true enough. But I really do think I shan't have to tell him
      at all, since you've put it to me that way!'
    </p>
    <p>
      As it was now Johnny's bedtime he was carried upstairs, and when Selina
      came down again her mother observed with some anxiety, 'I fancy Mr. Clark
      must be here soon if he's coming; and that being so, perhaps Mr. Miller
      wouldn't mind-wishing us good-night! since you are so determined to stick
      to your sergeant-major.' A little bitterness bubbled amid the closing
      words. 'It would be less awkward, Mr. Miller not being here-if he will
      allow me to say it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'To be sure; to be sure,' the master-wheelwright exclaimed with instant
      conviction, rising alertly from his chair. 'Lord bless my soul,' he said,
      taking up his hat and stick, 'and we to have been married in six days! But
      Selina-you're right. You do belong to the child's father since he's alive.
      I'll try to make the best of it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the generous Miller had got further there came a knock to the door
      accompanied by the noise of wheels.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I thought I heard something driving up!' said Mrs Paddock.
    </p>
    <p>
      They heard Mr. Paddock, who had been smoking in the room opposite, rise
      and go to the door, and in a moment a voice familiar enough to Selina was
      audibly saying, 'At last I am here again-not without many interruptions!
      How is it with 'ee, Mr. Paddock? And how is she? Thought never to see me
      again, I suppose?'
    </p>
    <p>
      A step with a cCHANGElink of spurs in it struck upon the entry floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Danged if I bain't catched!' murmured Mr. Miller, forgetting company-
      speech. 'Never mind-I may as well meet him here as elsewhere; and I should
      like to see the chap, and make friends with en, as he seems one o' the
      right sort.' He returned to the fireplace just as the sergeant- major was
      ushered in. III
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a good specimen of the long-service soldier of those days; a not
      unhandsome man, with a certain undemonstrative dignity, which some might
      have said to be partly owing to the stiffness of his uniform about his
      neck, the high stock being still worn. He was much stouter than when
      Selina had parted from him. Although she had not meant to be demonstrative
      she ran across to him directly she saw him, and he held her in his arms
      and kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then in much agitation she whispered something to him, at which he seemed
      to be much surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He's just put to bed,' she continued. 'You can go up and see him. I knew
      you'd come if you were alive! But I had quite gi'd you up for dead. You've
      been home in England ever since the war ended?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, dear.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why didn't you come sooner?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's just what I ask myself! Why was I such a sappy as not to hurry
      here the first day I set foot on shore! Well, who'd have thought it-you
      are as pretty as ever!'
    </p>
    <p>
      He relinquished her to peep upstairs a little way, where, by looking
      through the ballusters, he could see Johnny's cot just within an open
      door. On his stepping down again Mr. Miller was preparing to depart.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now, what's this? I am sorry to see anybody going the moment I've come,'
      expostulated the sergeant-major. 'I thought we might make an evening of
      it. There's a nine gallon cask o' "Phoenix" beer outside in the trap, and
      a ham, and half a rawmil' cheese; for I thought you might be short o'
      forage in a lonely place like this; and it struck me we might like to ask
      in a neighbour or two. But perhaps it would be taking a liberty?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no, not at all,' said Mr. Paddock, who was now in the room, in a
      judicial measured manner. 'Very thoughtful of 'ee, only 'twas not
      necessary, for we had just laid in an extry stock of eatables and
      drinkables in preparation for the coming event.'
    </p>
    <p>
      ''Twas very kind, upon my heart,' said the soldier, 'to think me worth
      such a jocund preparation, since you could only have got my letter this
      morning.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Selina gazed at her father to stop him, and exchanged embarrassed glances
      with Miller. Contrary to her hopes Sergeant-Major Clark plainly did not
      know that the preparations referred to were for something quite other than
      his own visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The movement of the horse outside, and the impatient tapping of a whip-
      handle upon the vehicle reminded them that Clark's driver was still in
      waiting. The provisions were brought into the house, and the cart
      dismissed. Miller, with very little pressure indeed, accepted an
      invitation to supper, and a few neighbours were induced to come in to make
      up a cheerful party.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the laying of the meal, and throughout its continuance, Selina, who
      sat beside her first intended husband, tried frequently to break the news
      to him of her engagement to the other-now terminated so suddenly, and so
      happily for her heart, and her sense of womanly virtue. But the talk ran
      entirely upon the late war; and though fortified by half a horn of the
      strong ale brought by the sergeant-major she decided that she might have a
      better opportunity when supper was over of revealing the situation to him
      in private.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having supped, Clark leaned back at ease in his chair and looked around.
      'We used sometimes to have a dance in that other room after supper, Selina
      dear, I recollect. We used to clear out all the furniture into this room
      before beginning. Have you kept up such goings on?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, not at all!' said his sweetheart, sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'We were not unlikely to revive it in a few days,' said Mr. Paddock. 'But,
      howsomever, there's seemingly many a slip, as the saying is.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, I'll tell John all about that by and by!' interposed Selina; at
      which, perceiving that the secret which he did not like keeping was to be
      kept even yet, her father held his tongue with some show of testiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The subject of a dance having been broached, to put the thought in
      practice was the feeling of all. Soon after the tables and chairs were
      borne from the opposite room to this by zealous hands, and two of the
      villagers sent home for a fiddle and tambourine, when the majority began
      to tread a measure well known in that secluded vale. Selina naturally
      danced with the sergeant-major, not altogether to her father's
      satisfaction, and to the real uneasiness of her mother, both of whom would
      have preferred a postponement of festivities till the rashly anticipated
      relationship between their daughter and Clark in the past had been made
      fact by the church's ordinances. They did not, however, express a positive
      objection, Mr. Paddock remembering, with self- reproach, that it was owing
      to his original strongly expressed disapproval of Selina's being a
      soldier's wife that the wedding had been delayed, and finally
      hindered-with worse consequences than were expected; and ever since the
      misadventure brought about by his government he had allowed events to
      steer their own courses.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My tails will surely catch in your spurs, John!' murmured the daughter of
      the house, as she whirled around upon his arm with the rapt soul and look
      of a somnambulist. 'I didn't know we should dance, or I would have put on
      my other frock.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll take care, my love. We've danced here before. Do you think your
      father objects to me now? I've risen in rank. I fancy he's still a little
      against me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He has repented, times enough.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And so have I! If I had married you then 'twould have saved many a
      misfortune. I have sometimes thought it might have been possible to rush
      the ceremony through somehow before I left; though we were only in the
      second asking, were we? And even if I had come back straight here when we
      returned from the Crimea, and married you then, how much happier I should
      have been!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dear John, to say that! Why didn't you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O-dilatoriness and want of thought, and a fear of facing your father
      after so long. I was in hospital a great while, you know. But how familiar
      the place seems again! What's that I saw on the beaufet in the other room?
      It never used to be there. A sort of withered corpse of a cake-not an old
      bride-cake surely?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, John, ours. 'Tis the very one that was made for our wedding three
      years ago.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sakes alive! Why, time shuts up together, and all between then and now
      seems not to have been! What became of that wedding-gown that they were
      making in this room, I remember-a bluish, whitish, frothy thing?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have that too.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Really! . . . Why, Selina-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why not put it on now?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Wouldn't it seem-. And yet, O how I should like to! It would remind them
      all, if we told them what it was, how we really meant to be married on
      that bygone day!' Her eyes were again laden with wet.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes . . . The pity that we didn't-the pity!' Moody mournfulness seemed to
      hold silent awhile one not naturally taciturn. 'Well-will you?' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will-the next dance, if mother don't mind.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, just before the next figure was formed, Selina disappeared,
      and speedily came downstairs in a creased and box-worn, but still airy and
      pretty, muslin gown, which was indeed the very one that had been meant to
      grace her as a bride three years before.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is dreadfully old-fashioned,' she apologized.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not at all. What a grand thought of mine! Now, let's to't again.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She explained to some of them, as he led her to the second dance, what the
      frock had been meant for, and that she had put it on at his request. And
      again athwart and around the room they went.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You seem the bride!' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But I couldn't wear this gown to be married in now!' she replied,
      ecstatically, 'or I shouldn't have put it on and made it dusty. It is
      really too old-fashioned, and so folded and fretted out, you can't think.
      That was with my taking it out so many times to look at. I have never put
      it on-never-till now!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Selina, I am thinking of giving up the army. Will you emigrate with me to
      New Zealand? I've an uncle out there doing well, and he'd soon help me to
      making a larger income. The English army is glorious, but it ain't
      altogether enriching.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of course, anywhere that you decide upon. Is it healthy there for
      Johnny?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A lovely climate. And I shall never be happy in England . . . Aha!' he
      concluded again, with a bitterness of unexpected strength, 'would to
      Heaven I had come straight back here!'
    </p>
    <p>
      As the dance brought round one neighbour after another the re-united pair
      were thrown into juxtaposition with Bob Heartall among the rest who had
      been called in; one whose chronic expression was that he carried inside
      him a joke on the point of bursting with its own vastness. He took
      occasion now to let out a little of its quality, shaking his head at
      Selina as he addressed her in an undertone-
    </p>
    <p>
      'This is a bit of a topper to the bridegroom, ho ho! 'Twill teach en the
      liberty you'll expect when you've married en!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What does he mean by a "topper,"' the sergeant-major asked, who, not
      being of local extraction, despised the venerable local language, and also
      seemed to suppose 'bridegroom' to be an anticipatory name for himself. 'I
      only hope I shall never be worse treated than you've treated me to-night!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Selina looked frightened. 'He didn't mean you, dear,' she said as they
      moved on. 'We thought perhaps you knew what had happened, owing to your
      coming just at this time. Had you-heard anything about-what I intended?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not a breath-how should I-away up in Yorkshire? It was by the merest
      accident that I came just at this date to make peace with you for my
      delay.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I was engaged to be married to Mr. Bartholomew Miller. That's what it is!
      I would have let 'ee know by letter, but there was no time, only hearing
      from 'ee this afternoon . . . You won't desert me for it, will you, John?
      Because, as you know, I quite supposed you dead, and-and-' Her eyes were
      full of tears of trepidation, and he might have felt a sob heaving within
      her. IV
    </p>
    <p>
      The soldier was silent during two or three double bars of the tune. 'When
      were you to have been married to the said Mr. Bartholomew Miller?' he
      inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Quite soon.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How soon?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Next week-O yes-just the same as it was with you and me. There's a
      strange fate of interruption hanging over me, I sometimes think! He had
      bought the licence, which I preferred so that it mightn't be like-ours.
      But it made no difference to the fate of it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Had bought the licence! The devil!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't be angry, dear John. I didn't know!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, no, I'm not angry.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It was so kind of him, considering!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes . . . I see, of course, how natural your action was-never thinking of
      seeing me any more! Is it the Mr. Miller who is in this dance?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Clark glanced round upon Bartholomew and was silent again, for some little
      while, and she stole a look at him, to find that he seemed changed. 'John,
      you look ill!' she almost sobbed. ''Tisn't me, is it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O dear, no. Though I hadn't, somehow, expected it. I can't find fault
      with you for a moment-and I don't . . . This is a deuce of a long dance,
      don't you think? We've been at it twenty minutes if a second, and the
      figure doesn't allow one much rest. I'm quite out of breath.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'They like them so dreadfully long here. Shall we drop out? Or I'll stop
      the fiddler.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no, no, I think I can finish. But although I look healthy enough I have
      never been so strong as I formerly was, since that long illness I had in
      the hospital at Scutari.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And I knew nothing about it!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You couldn't, dear, as I didn't write. What a fool I have been
      altogether!' He gave a twitch, as of one in pain. 'I won't dance again
      when this one is over. The fact is I have travelled a long way to-day, and
      it seems to have knocked me up a bit.'
    </p>
    <p>
      There could be no doubt that the sergeant-major was unwell, and Selina
      made herself miserable by still believing that her story was the cause of
      his ailment. Suddenly he said in a changed voice, and she perceived that
      he was paler than ever: 'I must sit down.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Letting go her waist he went quickly to the other room. She followed, and
      found him in the nearest chair, his face bent down upon his hands and
      arms, which were resting on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What's the matter?' said her father, who sat there dozing by the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      'John isn't well . . . We are going to New Zealand when we are married,
      father. A lovely country! John, would you like something to drink?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A drop o' that Schiedam of old Owlett's, that's under stairs, perhaps,'
      suggested her father. 'Not that nowadays 'tis much better than licensed
      liquor.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'John,' she said, putting her face close to his and pressing his arm.
      'Will you have a drop of spirits or something?'
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not reply, and Selina observed that his ear and the side of his
      face were quite white. Convinced that his illness was serious, a growing
      dismay seized hold of her. The dance ended; her mother came in, and
      learning what had happened, looked narrowly at the sergeant-major.
    </p>
    <p>
      'We must not let him lie like that, lift him up,' she said. 'Let him rest
      in the window-bench on some cushions.'
    </p>
    <p>
      They unfolded his arms and hands as they lay clasped upon the table, and
      on lifting his head found his features to bear the very impress of death
      itself. Bartholomew Miller, who had now come in, assisted Mr. Paddock to
      make a comfortable couch in the window-seat, where they stretched out
      Clark upon his back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still he seemed unconscious. 'We must get a doctor,' said Selina. 'O, my
      dear John, how is it you be taken like this?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'My impression is that he's dead!' murmured Mr. Paddock. 'He don't breathe
      enough to move a tomtit's feather.'
    </p>
    <p>
      There were plenty to volunteer to go for a doctor, but as it would be at
      least an hour before he could get there the case seemed somewhat hopeless.
      The dancing-party ended as unceremoniously as it had begun; but the guests
      lingered round the premises till the doctor should arrive. When he did
      come the sergeant-major's extremities were already cold, and there was no
      doubt that death had overtaken him almost at the moment that he had sat
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      The medical practitioner quite refused to accept the unhappy Selina's
      theory that her revelation had in any way induced Clark's sudden collapse.
      Both he and the coroner afterwards, who found the immediate cause to be
      heart-failure, held that such a supposition was unwarranted by facts. They
      asserted that a long day's journey, a hurried drive, and then an
      exhausting dance, were sufficient for such a result upon a heart enfeebled
      by fatty degeneration after the privations of a Crimean winter and other
      trying experiences, the coincidence of the sad event with any disclosure
      of hers being a pure accident.
    </p>
    <p>
      This conclusion, however, did not dislodge Selina's opinion that the shock
      of her statement had been the immediate stroke which had felled a
      constitution so undermined. V
    </p>
    <p>
      At this date the Casterbridge Barracks were cavalry quarters, their
      adaptation to artillery having been effected some years later. It had been
      owing to the fact that the &mdash;-th Dragoons, in which John Clark had
      served, happened to be lying there that Selina made his acquaintance. At
      the time of his death the barracks were occupied by the Scots Greys, but
      when the pathetic circumstances of the sergeant-major's end became known
      in the town the officers of the Greys offered the services of their fine
      reed and brass band, that he might have a funeral marked by due military
      honours. His body was accordingly removed to the barracks, and carried
      thence to the churchyard in the Durnover quarter on the following
      afternoon, one of the Greys' most ancient and docile chargers being
      blacked up to represent Clark's horse on the occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everybody pitied Selina, whose story was well known. She followed the
      corpse as the only mourner, Clark having been without relations in this
      part of the country, and a communication with his regiment having brought
      none from a distance. She sat in a little shabby brown-black mourning
      carriage, squeezing herself up in a corner to be as much as possible out
      of sight during the slow and dramatic march through the town to the tune
      from Saul. When the interment had taken place, the volleys been fired, and
      the return journey begun, it was with something like a shock that she
      found the military escort to be moving at a quick march to the lively
      strains of 'Off she goes!' as if all care for the sergeant-major was
      expected to be ended with the late discharge of the carbines. It was, by
      chance, the very tune to which they had been footing when he died, and
      unable to bear its notes, she hastily told her driver to drop behind. The
      band and military party diminished up the High Street, and Selina turned
      over Swan bridge and homeward to Mellstock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then recommenced for her a life whose incidents were precisely of a suit
      with those which had preceded the soldier's return; but how different in
      her appreciation of them! Her narrow miss of the recovered respectability
      they had hoped for from that tardy event worked upon her parents as an
      irritant, and after the first week or two of her mourning her life with
      them grew almost insupportable. She had impulsively taken to herself the
      weeds of a widow, for such she seemed to herself to be, and clothed little
      Johnny in sables likewise. This assumption of a moral relationship to the
      deceased, which she asserted to be only not a legal one by two most
      unexpected accidents, led the old people to indulge in sarcasm at her
      expense whenever they beheld her attire, though all the while it cost them
      more pain to utter than it gave her to hear it. Having become accustomed
      by her residence at home to the business carried on by her father, she
      surprised them one day by going off with the child to Chalk-Newton, in the
      direction of the town of Ivell, and opening a miniature fruit and
      vegetable shop, attending Ivell market with her produce. Her business grew
      somewhat larger, and it was soon sufficient to enable her to support
      herself and the boy in comfort. She called herself 'Mrs. John Clark' from
      the day of leaving home, and painted the name on her signboard-no man
      forbidding her.
    </p>
    <p>
      By degrees the pain of her state was forgotten in her new circumstances,
      and getting to be generally accepted as the widow of a sergeant-major of
      dragoons-an assumption which her modest and mournful demeanour seemed to
      substantiate-her life became a placid one, her mind being nourished by the
      melancholy luxury of dreaming what might have been her future in New
      Zealand with John, if he had only lived to take her there. Her only
      travels now were a journey to Ivell on market-days, and once a fortnight
      to the churchyard in which Clark lay, there to tend, with Johnny's
      assistance, as widows are wont to do, the flowers she had planted upon his
      grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a day about eighteen months after his unexpected decease, Selina was
      surprised in her lodging over her little shop by a visit from Bartholomew
      Miller. He had called on her once or twice before, on which occasions he
      had used without a word of comment the name by which she was known.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I've come this time,' he said, 'less because I was in this direction than
      to ask you, Mrs. Clark, what you mid well guess. I've come o' purpose, in
      short.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      ''Tis to ask me again to marry you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, of course. You see, his coming back for 'ee proved what I always
      believed of 'ee, though others didn't. There's nobody but would be glad to
      welcome you to our parish again, now you've showed your independence and
      acted up to your trust in his promise. Well, my dear, will you come?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'd rather bide as Mrs. Clark, I think,' she answered. 'I am not ashamed
      of my position at all; for I am John's widow in the eyes of Heaven.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I quite agree-that's why I've come. Still, you won't like to be always
      straining at this shop-keeping and market-standing; and 'twould be better
      for Johnny if you had nothing to do but tend him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He here touched the only weak spot in Selina's resistance to his
      proposal-the good of the boy. To promote that there were other men she
      might have married offhand without loving them if they had asked her to;
      but though she had known the worthy speaker from her youth, she could not
      for the moment fancy herself happy as Mrs. Miller.
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused awhile. 'I ought to tell 'ee, Mrs. Clark,' he said by and by,
      'that marrying is getting to be a pressing question with me. Not on my own
      account at all. The truth is, that mother is growing old, and I am away
      from home a good deal, so that it is almost necessary there should be
      another person in the house with her besides me. That's the practical
      consideration which forces me to think of taking a wife, apart from my
      wish to take you; and you know there's nobody in the world I care for so
      much.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She said something about there being far better women than she, and other
      natural commonplaces; but assured him she was most grateful to him for
      feeling what he felt, as indeed she sincerely was. However, Selina would
      not consent to be the useful third person in his comfortable home-at any
      rate just then. He went away, after taking tea with her, without
      discerning much hope for him in her good-bye. VI
    </p>
    <p>
      After that evening she saw and heard nothing of him for a great while. Her
      fortnightly journeys to the sergeant-major's grave were continued,
      whenever weather did not hinder them; and Mr. Miller must have known, she
      thought, of this custom of hers. But though the churchyard was not nearly
      so far from his homestead as was her shop at Chalk-Newton, he never
      appeared in the accidental way that lovers use.
    </p>
    <p>
      An explanation was forthcoming in the shape of a letter from her mother,
      who casually mentioned that Mr. Bartholomew Miller had gone away to the
      other side of Shottsford-Forum to be married to a thriving dairyman's
      daughter that he knew there. His chief motive, it was reported, had been
      less one of love than a wish to provide a companion for his aged mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Selina was practical enough to know that she had lost a good and possibly
      the only opportunity of settling in life after what had happened, and for
      a moment she regretted her independence. But she became calm on
      reflection, and to fortify herself in her course started that afternoon to
      tend the sergeant-major's grave, in which she took the same sober pleasure
      as at first.
    </p>
    <p>
      On reaching the churchyard and turning the corner towards the spot as
      usual, she was surprised to perceive another woman, also apparently a
      respectable widow, and with a tiny boy by her side, bending over Clark's
      turf, and spudding up with the point of her umbrella some ivy-roots that
      Selina had reverently planted there to form an evergreen mantle over the
      mound.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What are you digging up my ivy for!' cried Selina, rushing forward so
      excitedly that Johnny tumbled over a grave with the force of the tug she
      gave his hand in her sudden start.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Your ivy?' said the respectable woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why yes! I planted it there-on my husband's grave.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Your husband's!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. The late Sergeant-Major Clark. Anyhow, as good as my husband, for he
      was just going to be.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Indeed. But who may be my husband, if not he? I am the only Mrs. John
      Clark, widow of the late Sergeant-Major of Dragoons, and this is his only
      son and heir.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How can that be?' faltered Selina, her throat seeming to stick together
      as she just began to perceive its possibility. 'He had been-going to marry
      me twice-and we were going to New Zealand.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah!-I remember about you,' returned the legitimate widow calmly and not
      unkindly. 'You must be Selina; he spoke of you now and then, and said that
      his relations with you would always be a weight on his conscience. Well;
      the history of my life with him is soon told. When he came back from the
      Crimea he became acquainted with me at my home in the north, and we were
      married within a month of first knowing each other. Unfortunately, after
      living together a few months, we could not agree; and after a particularly
      sharp quarrel, in which, perhaps, I was most in the wrong-as I don't mind
      owning here by his graveside-he went away from me, declaring he would buy
      his discharge and emigrate to New Zealand, and never come back to me any
      more. The next thing I heard was that he had died suddenly at Mellstock at
      some low carouse; and as he had left me in such anger to live no more with
      me, I wouldn't come down to his funeral, or do anything in relation to
      him. 'Twas temper, I know, but that was the fact. Even if we had parted
      friends it would have been a serious expense to travel three hundred miles
      to get there, for one who wasn't left so very well off . . . I am sorry I
      pulled up your ivy- roots; but that common sort of ivy is considered a
      weed in my part of the country.'
    </p>

    <h2>
      A TRYST AT AN ANCIENT EARTH WORK
    </h2>
    <p>
      At one's every step forward it rises higher against the south sky, with an
      obtrusive personality that compels the senses to regard it and consider.
      The eyes may bend in another direction, but never without the
      consciousness of its heavy, high-shouldered presence at its point of
      vantage. Across the intervening levels the gale races in a straight line
      from the fort, as if breathed out of it hitherward. With the shifting of
      the clouds the faces of the steeps vary in colour and in shade, broad
      lights appearing where mist and vagueness had prevailed, dissolving in
      their turn into melancholy gray, which spreads over and eclipses the
      luminous bluffs. In this so-thought immutable spectacle all is change.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of the invisible marine region on the other side birds soar suddenly
      into the air, and hang over the summits of the heights with the
      indifference of long familiarity. Their forms are white against the tawny
      concave of cloud, and the curves they exhibit in their floating signify
      that they are sea-gulls which have journeyed inland from expected stress
      of weather. As the birds rise behind the fort, so do the clouds rise
      behind the birds, almost as it seems, stroking with their bagging bosoms
      the uppermost flyers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The profile of the whole stupendous ruin, as seen at a distance of a mile
      eastward, is cleanly cut as that of a marble inlay. It is varied with
      protuberances, which from hereabouts have the animal aspect of warts,
      wens, knuckles, and hips. It may indeed be likened to an enormous
      many-limbed organism of an antediluvian time-partaking of the cephalopod
      in shape-lying lifeless, and covered with a thin green cloth, which hides
      its substance, while revealing its contour. This dull green mantle of
      herbage stretches down towards the levels, where the ploughs have essayed
      for centuries to creep up near and yet nearer to the base of the castle,
      but have always stopped short before reaching it. The furrows of these
      environing attempts show themselves distinctly, bending to the incline as
      they trench upon it; mounting in steeper curves, till the steepness
      baffles them, and their parallel threads show like the striae of waves
      pausing on the curl. The peculiar place of which these are some of the
      features is 'Mai-Dun,' 'The Castle of the Great Hill,' said to be the
      Dunium of Ptolemy, the capital of the Durotriges, which eventually came
      into Roman occupation, and was finally deserted on their withdrawal from
      the island.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The evening is followed by a night on which an invisible moon bestows a
      subdued, yet pervasive light-without radiance, as without blackness. From
      the spot whereon I am ensconced in a cottage, a mile away, the fort has
      now ceased to be visible; yet, as by day, to anybody whose thoughts have
      been engaged with it and its barbarous grandeurs of past time the form
      asserts its existence behind the night gauzes as persistently as if it had
      a voice. Moreover, the south-west wind continues to feed the intervening
      arable flats with vapours brought directly from its sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      The midnight hour for which there has been occasion to wait at length
      arrives, and I journey towards the stronghold in obedience to a request
      urged earlier in the day. It concerns an appointment, which I rather
      regret my decision to keep now that night is come. The route thither is
      hedgeless and treeless-I need not add deserted. The moonlight is
      sufficient to disclose the pale riband-like surface of the way as it
      trails along between the expanses of darker fallow. Though the road passes
      near the fortress it does not conduct directly to its fronts. As the place
      is without an inhabitant, so it is without a trackway. So presently
      leaving the macadamized road to pursue its course elsewhither, I step off
      upon the fallow, and plod stumblingly across it. The castle looms out off
      the shade by degrees, like a thing waking up and asking what I want there.
      It is now so enlarged by nearness that its whole shape cannot be taken in
      at one view. The ploughed ground ends as the rise sharpens, the sloping
      basement of grass begins, and I climb upward to invade Mai-Dun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Impressive by day as this largest Ancient-British work in the kingdom
      undoubtedly is, its impressiveness is increased now. After standing still
      and spending a few minutes in adding its age to its size, and its size to
      its solitude, it becomes appallingly mournful in its growing closeness. A
      squally wind blows in the face with an impact which proclaims that the
      vapours of the air sail low to-night. The slope that I so laboriously
      clamber up the wind skips sportively down. Its track can be discerned even
      in this light by the undulations of the withered grass-bents-the only
      produce of this upland summit except moss. Four minutes of ascent, and a
      vantage-ground of some sort is gained. It is only the crest of the outer
      rampart. Immediately within this a chasm gapes; its bottom is
      imperceptible, but the counterscarp slopes not too steeply to admit of a
      sliding descent if cautiously performed. The shady bottom, dank and
      chilly, is thus gained, and reveals itself as a kind of winding lane, wide
      enough for a waggon to pass along, floored with rank herbage, and trending
      away, right and left, into obscurity, between the concentric walls of
      earth. The towering closeness of these on each hand, their
      impenetrability, and their ponderousness, are felt as a physical pressure.
      The way is now up the second of them, which stands steeper and higher than
      the first. To turn aside, as did Christian's companion, from such a Hill
      Difficulty, is the more natural tendency; but the way to the interior is
      upward. There is, of course, an entrance to the fortress; but that lies
      far off on the other side. It might possibly have been the wiser course to
      seek for easier ingress there.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, being here, I ascend the second acclivity. The grass stems-the
      grey beard of the hill-sway in a mass close to my stooping face. The dead
      heads of these various grasses-fescues, fox-tails, and ryes-bob and twitch
      as if pulled by a string underground. From a few thistles a whistling
      proceeds; and even the moss speaks, in its humble way, under the stress of
      the blast.
    </p>
    <p>
      That the summit of the second line of defence has been gained is suddenly
      made known by a contrasting wind from a new quarter, coming over with the
      curve of a cascade. These novel gusts raise a sound from the whole camp or
      castle, playing upon it bodily as upon a harp. It is with some difficulty
      that a foothold can be preserved under their sweep. Looking aloft for a
      moment I perceive that the sky is much more overcast than it has been
      hitherto, and in a few instants a dead lull in what is now a gale ensues
      with almost preternatural abruptness. I take advantage of this to sidle
      down the second counterscarp, but by the time the ditch is reached the
      lull reveals itself to be but the precursor of a storm. It begins with a
      heave of the whole atmosphere, like the sigh of a weary strong man on
      turning to re-commence unusual exertion, just as I stand here in the
      second fosse. That which now radiates from the sky upon the scene is not
      so much light as vaporous phosphorescence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wind, quickening, abandons the natural direction it has pursued on the
      open upland, and takes the course of the gorge's length, rushing along
      therein helter-skelter, and carrying thick rain upon its back. The rain is
      followed by hailstones which fly through the defile in battalions-rolling,
      hopping, ricochetting, snapping, clattering down the shelving banks in an
      undefinable haze of confusion. The earthen sides of the fosse seem to
      quiver under the drenching onset, though it is practically no more to them
      than the blows of Thor upon the giant of Jotun-land. It is impossible to
      proceed further till the storm somewhat abates, and I draw up behind a
      spur of the inner scarp, where possibly a barricade stood two thousand
      years ago; and thus await events.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The roar of the storm can be heard travelling the complete circuit of the
      castle-a measured mile-coming round at intervals like a circumambulating
      column of infantry. Doubtless such a column has passed this way in its
      time, but the only columns which enter in these latter days are the
      columns of sheep and oxen that are sometimes seen here now; while the only
      semblance of heroic voices heard are the utterances of such, and of the
      many winds which make their passage through the ravines.
    </p>
    <p>
      The expected lightning radiates round, and a rumbling as from its
      subterranean vaults-if there are any-fills the castle. The lightning
      repeats itself, and, coming after the aforesaid thoughts of martial men,
      it bears a fanciful resemblance to swords moving in combat. It has the
      very brassy hue of the ancient weapons that here were used. The so sudden
      entry upon the scene of this metallic flame is as the entry of a presiding
      exhibitor who unrolls the maps, uncurtains the pictures, unlocks the
      cabinets, and effects a transformation by merely exposing the materials of
      his science, unintelligibly cloaked till then. The abrupt configuration of
      the bluffs and mounds is now for the first time clearly revealed-mounds
      whereon, doubtless, spears and shields have frequently lain while their
      owners loosened their sandals and yawned and stretched their arms in the
      sun. For the first time, too, a glimpse is obtainable of the true entrance
      used by its occupants of old, some way ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      There, where all passage has seemed to be inviolably barred by an almost
      vertical facade, the ramparts are found to overlap each other like loosely
      clasped fingers, between which a zigzag path may be followed-a cunning
      construction that puzzles the uninformed eye. But its cunning, even where
      not obscured by dilapidation, is now wasted on the solitary forms of a few
      wild badgers, rabbits, and hares. Men must have often gone out by those
      gates in the morning to battle with the Roman legions under Vespasian;
      some to return no more, others to come back at evening, bringing with them
      the noise of their heroic deeds. But not a page, not a stone, has
      preserved their fame.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Acoustic perceptions multiply to-night. We can almost hear the stream of
      years that have borne those deeds away from us. Strange articulations seem
      to float on the air from that point, the gateway, where the animation in
      past times must frequently have concentrated itself at hours of coming and
      going, and general excitement. There arises an ineradicable fancy that
      they are human voices; if so, they must be the lingering air-borne
      vibrations of conversations uttered at least fifteen hundred years ago.
      The attention is attracted from mere nebulous imaginings about yonder spot
      by a real moving of something close at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      I recognize by the now moderate flashes of lightning, which are sheet-
      like and nearly continuous, that it is the gradual elevation of a small
      mound of earth. At first no larger than a man's fist it reaches the
      dimensions of a hat, then sinks a little and is still. It is but the
      heaving of a mole who chooses such weather as this to work in from some
      instinct that there will be nobody abroad to molest him. As the fine earth
      lifts and lifts and falls loosely aside fragments of burnt clay roll out
      of it-clay that once formed part of cups or other vessels used by the
      inhabitants of the fortress.
    </p>
    <p>
      The violence of the storm has been counterbalanced by its transitoriness.
      From being immersed in well-nigh solid media of cloud and hail shot with
      lightning, I find myself uncovered of the humid investiture and left bare
      to the mild gaze of the moon, which sparkles now on every wet grass-blade
      and frond of moss.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I am not yet inside the fort, and the delayed ascent of the third and
      last escarpment is now made. It is steeper than either. The first was a
      surface to walk up, the second to stagger up, the third can only be
      ascended on the hands and toes. On the summit obtrudes the first evidence
      which has been met with in these precincts that the time is really the
      nineteenth century; it is in the form of a white notice-board on a post,
      and the wording can just be discerned by the rays of the setting moon:
    </p>
    <p>
      CAUTION.-Any Person found removing Relics, Skeletons, Stones, Pottery,
      Tiles, or other Material from this Earthwork, or cutting up the Ground,
      will be Prosecuted as the Law directs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here one observes a difference underfoot from what has gone before: scraps
      of Roman tile and stone chippings protrude through the grass in meagre
      quantity, but sufficient to suggest that masonry stood on the spot. Before
      the eye stretches under the moonlight the interior of the fort. So open
      and so large is it as to be practically an upland plateau, and yet its
      area lies wholly within the walls of what may be designated as one
      building. It is a long-violated retreat; all its corner-stones, plinths,
      and architraves were carried away to build neighbouring villages even
      before mediaeval or modern history began. Many a block which once may have
      helped to form a bastion here rests now in broken and diminished shape as
      part of the chimney-corner of some shepherd's cottage within the distant
      horizon, and the corner-stones of this heathen altar may form the
      base-course of some adjoining village church.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet the very bareness of these inner courts and wards, their condition of
      mere pasturage, protects what remains of them as no defences could do.
      Nothing is left visible that the hands can seize on or the weather
      overturn, and a permanence of general outline at least results, which no
      other condition could ensure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The position of the castle on this isolated hill bespeaks deliberate and
      strategic choice exercised by some remote mind capable of prospective
      reasoning to a far extent. The natural configuration of the surrounding
      country and its bearing upon such a stronghold were obviously long
      considered and viewed mentally before its extensive design was carried
      into execution. Who was the man that said, 'Let it be built here!'-not on
      that hill yonder, or on that ridge behind, but on this best spot of all?
      Whether he were some great one of the Belgae, or of the Durotriges, or the
      travelling engineer of Britain's united tribes, must for ever remain
      time's secret; his form cannot be realized, nor his countenance, nor the
      tongue that he spoke, when he set down his foot with a thud and said, 'Let
      it be here!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Within the innermost enclosure, though it is so wide that at a superficial
      glance the beholder has only a sense of standing on a breezy down, the
      solitude is rendered yet more solitary by the knowledge that between the
      benighted sojourner herein and all kindred humanity are those three
      concentric walls of earth which no being would think of scaling on such a
      night as this, even were he to hear the most pathetic cries issuing hence
      that could be uttered by a spectre-chased soul. I reach a central mound or
      platform-the crown and axis of the whole structure. The view from here by
      day must be of almost limitless extent. On this raised floor, dais, or
      rostrum, harps have probably twanged more or less tuneful notes in
      celebration of daring, strength, or cruelty; of worship, superstition,
      love, birth, and death; of simple loving-kindness perhaps never. Many a
      time must the king or leader have directed his keen eyes hence across the
      open lands towards the ancient road, the Icening Way, still visible in the
      distance, on the watch for armed companies approaching either to succour
      or to attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am startled by a voice pronouncing my name. Past and present have become
      so confusedly mingled under the associations of the spot that for a time
      it has escaped my memory that this mound was the place agreed on for the
      aforesaid appointment. I turn and behold my friend. He stands with a dark
      lantern in his hand and a spade and light pickaxe over his shoulder. He
      expresses both delight and surprise that I have come. I tell him I had set
      out before the bad weather began.
    </p>
    <p>
      He, to whom neither weather, darkness, nor difficulty seems to have any
      relation or significance, so entirely is his soul wrapped up in his own
      deep intentions, asks me to take the lantern and accompany him. I take it
      and walk by his side. He is a man about sixty, small in figure, with grey
      old-fashioned whiskers cut to the shape of a pair of crumb-brushes. He is
      entirely in black broadcloth-or rather, at present, black and brown, for
      he is bespattered with mud from his heels to the crown of his low hat. He
      has no consciousness of this-no sense of anything but his purpose, his
      ardour for which causes his eyes to shine like those of a lynx, and gives
      his motions, all the elasticity of an athlete's.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nobody to interrupt us at this time of night!' he chuckles with fierce
      enjoyment.
    </p>
    <p>
      We retreat a little way and find a sort of angle, an elevation in the sod,
      a suggested squareness amid the mass of irregularities around. Here, he
      tells me, if anywhere, the king's house stood. Three months of measurement
      and calculation have confirmed him in this conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      He requests me now to open the lantern, which I do, and the light streams
      out upon the wet sod. At last divining his proceedings I say that I had no
      idea, in keeping the tryst, that he was going to do more at such an
      unusual time than meet me for a meditative ramble through the stronghold.
      I ask him why, having a practicable object, he should have minded
      interruptions and not have chosen the day? He informs me, quietly pointing
      to his spade, that it was because his purpose is to dig, then signifying
      with a grim nod the gaunt notice-post against the sky beyond. I inquire
      why, as a professed and well-known antiquary with capital letters at the
      tail of his name, he did not obtain the necessary authority, considering
      the stringent penalties for this sort of thing; and he chuckles fiercely
      again with suppressed delight, and says, 'Because they wouldn't have given
      it!'
    </p>
    <p>
      He at once begins cutting up the sod, and, as he takes the pickaxe to
      follow on with, assures me that, penalty or no penalty, honest men or
      marauders, he is sure of one thing, that we shall not be disturbed at our
      work till after dawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remember to have heard of men who, in their enthusiasm for some special
      science, art, or hobby, have quite lost the moral sense which would
      restrain them from indulging it illegitimately; and I conjecture that
      here, at last, is an instance of such an one. He probably guesses the way
      my thoughts travel, for he stands up and solemnly asserts that he has a
      distinctly justifiable intention in this matter; namely, to uncover, to
      search, to verify a theory or displace it, and to cover up again. He means
      to take away nothing-not a grain of sand. In this he says he sees no such
      monstrous sin. I inquire if this is really a promise to me? He repeats
      that it is a promise, and resumes digging. My contribution to the labour
      is that of directing the light constantly upon the hole. When he has
      reached something more than a foot deep he digs more cautiously, saying
      that, be it much or little there, it will not lie far below the surface;
      such things never are deep. A few minutes later the point of the pickaxe
      clicks upon a stony substance. He draws the implement out as feelingly as
      if it had entered a man's body. Taking up the spade he shovels with care,
      and a surface, level as an altar, is presently disclosed. His eyes flash
      anew; he pulls handfuls of grass and mops the surface clean, finally
      rubbing it with his handkerchief. Grasping the lantern from my hand he
      holds it close to the ground, when the rays reveal a complete mosaic-a
      pavement of minute tesserae of many colours, of intricate pattern, a work
      of much art, of much time, and of much industry. He exclaims in a shout
      that he knew it always-that it is not a Celtic stronghold exclusively, but
      also a Roman; the former people having probably contributed little more
      than the original framework which the latter took and adapted till it
      became the present imposing structure.
    </p>
    <p>
      I ask, What if it is Roman?
    </p>
    <p>
      A great deal, according to him. That it proves all the world to be wrong
      in this great argument, and himself alone to be right! Can I wait while he
      digs further?
    </p>
    <p>
      I agree-reluctantly; but he does not notice my reluctance. At an adjoining
      spot he begins flourishing the tools anew with the skill of a navvy, this
      venerable scholar with letters after his name. Sometimes he falls on his
      knees, burrowing with his hands in the manner of a hare, and where his
      old-fashioned broadcloth touches the sides of the hole it gets plastered
      with the damp earth. He continually murmurs to himself how important, how
      very important, this discovery is! He draws out an object; we wash it in
      the same primitive way by rubbing it with the wet grass, and it proves to
      be a semi-transparent bottle of iridescent beauty, the sight of which
      draws groans of luxurious sensibility from the digger. Further and further
      search brings out a piece of a weapon. It is strange indeed that by merely
      peeling off a wrapper of modern accumulations we have lowered ourselves
      into an ancient world. Finally a skeleton is uncovered, fairly perfect. He
      lays it out on the grass, bone to its bone.
    </p>
    <p>
      My friend says the man must have fallen fighting here, as this is no place
      of burial. He turns again to the trench, scrapes, feels, till from a
      corner he draws out a heavy lump-a small image four or five inches high.
      We clean it as before. It is a statuette, apparently of gold, or, more
      probably, of bronze-gilt-a figure of Mercury, obviously, its head being
      surmounted with the petasus or winged hat, the usual accessory of that
      deity. Further inspection reveals the workmanship to be of good finish and
      detail, and, preserved by the limy earth, to be as fresh in every line as
      on the day it left the hands of its artificer.
    </p>
    <p>
      We seem to be standing in the Roman Forum and not on a hill in Wessex.
      Intent upon this truly valuable relic of the old empire of which even this
      remote spot was a component part, we do not notice what is going on in the
      present world till reminded of it by the sudden renewal of the storm.
      Looking up I perceive that the wide extinguisher of cloud has again
      settled down upon the fortress-town, as if resting upon the edge of the
      inner rampart, and shutting out the moon. I turn my back to the tempest,
      still directing the light across the hole. My companion digs on
      unconcernedly; he is living two thousand years ago, and despises things of
      the moment as dreams. But at last he is fairly beaten, and standing up
      beside me looks round on what he has done. The rays of the lantern pass
      over the trench to the tall skeleton stretched upon the grass on the other
      side. The beating rain has washed the bones clean and smooth, and the
      forehead, cheek-bones, and two-and-thirty teeth of the skull glisten in
      the candle-shine as they lie.
    </p>
    <p>
      This storm, like the first, is of the nature of a squall, and it ends as
      abruptly as the other. We dig no further. My friend says that it is
      enough-he has proved his point. He turns to replace the bones in the
      trench and covers them. But they fall to pieces under his touch: the air
      has disintegrated them, and he can only sweep in the fragments. The next
      act of his plan is more than difficult, but is carried out. The treasures
      are inhumed again in their respective holes: they are not ours. Each
      deposition seems to cost him a twinge; and at one moment I fancied I saw
      him slip his hand into his coat pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      'We must re-bury them all,' say I.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O yes,' he answers with integrity. 'I was wiping my hand.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The beauties of the tesselated floor of the governor's house are once
      again consigned to darkness; the trench is filled up; the sod laid
      smoothly down; he wipes the perspiration from his forehead with the same
      handkerchief he had used to mop the skeleton and tesserae clean; and we
      make for the eastern gate of the fortress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dawn bursts upon us suddenly as we reach the opening. It comes by the
      lifting and thinning of the clouds that way till we are bathed in a pink
      light. The direction of his homeward journey is not the same as mine, and
      we part under the outer slope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Walking along quickly to restore warmth I muse upon my eccentric friend,
      and cannot help asking myself this question: Did he really replace the
      gilded image of the god Mercurius with the rest of the treasures? He
      seemed to do so; and yet I could not testify to the fact. Probably,
      however, he was as good as his word.
    </p>
    <h3>
      * * *
    </h3>
    <p>
      It was thus I spoke to myself, and so the adventure ended. But one thing
      remains to be told, and that is concerned with seven years after. Among
      the effects of my friend, at that time just deceased, was found, carefully
      preserved, a gilt statuette representing Mercury, labelled 'Debased
      Roman.' No record was attached to explain how it came into his possession.
      The figure was bequeathed to the Casterbridge Museum.

      WHAT THE SHEPHERD SAW
    </h2>
    <h3>
      A TALE OF FOUR MOONLIGHT NIGHTS
    </h3>
    <p>
      The genial Justice of the Peace-now, alas, no more-who made himself
      responsible for the facts of this story, used to begin in the good old-
      fashioned way with a bright moonlight night and a mysterious figure, an
      excellent stroke for an opening, even to this day, if well followed up.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Christmas moon (he would say) was showing her cold face to the upland,
      the upland reflecting the radiance in frost-sparkles so minute as only to
      be discernible by an eye near at hand. This eye, he said, was the eye of a
      shepherd lad, young for his occupation, who stood within a wheeled hut of
      the kind commonly in use among sheep-keepers during the early lambing
      season, and was abstractedly looking through the loophole at the scene
      without.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spot was called Lambing Corner, and it was a sheltered portion of that
      wide expanse of rough pastureland known as the Marlbury Downs, which you
      directly traverse when following the turnpike-road across Mid- Wessex from
      London, through Aldbrickham, in the direction of Bath and Bristol. Here,
      where the hut stood, the land was high and dry, open, except to the north,
      and commanding an undulating view for miles. On the north side grew a tall
      belt of coarse furze, with enormous stalks, a clump of the same standing
      detached in front of the general mass. The clump was hollow, and the
      interior had been ingeniously taken advantage of as a position for the
      before-mentioned hut, which was thus completely screened from winds, and
      almost invisible, except through the narrow approach. But the furze twigs
      had been cut away from the two little windows of the hut, that the
      occupier might keep his eye on his sheep.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the rear, the shelter afforded by the belt of furze bushes was
      artificially improved by an inclosure of upright stakes, interwoven with
      boughs of the same prickly vegetation, and within the inclosure lay a
      renowned Marlbury-Down breeding flock of eight hundred ewes.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the south, in the direction of the young shepherd's idle gaze, there
      rose one conspicuous object above the uniform moonlit plateau, and only
      one. It was a Druidical trilithon, consisting of three oblong stones in
      the form of a doorway, two on end, and one across as a lintel. Each stone
      had been worn, scratched, washed, nibbled, split, and otherwise attacked
      by ten thousand different weathers; but now the blocks looked shapely and
      little the worse for wear, so beautifully were they silvered over by the
      light of the moon. The ruin was locally called the Devil's Door.
    </p>
    <p>
      An old shepherd presently entered the hut from the direction of the ewes,
      and looked around in the gloom. 'Be ye sleepy?' he asked in cross accents
      of the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lad replied rather timidly in the negative.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then,' said the shepherd, 'I'll get me home-along, and rest for a few
      hours. There's nothing to be done here now as I can see. The ewes can want
      no more tending till daybreak-'tis beyond the bounds of reason that they
      can. But as the order is that one of us must bide, I'll leave 'ee, d'ye
      hear. You can sleep by day, and I can't. And you can be down to my house
      in ten minutes if anything should happen. I can't afford 'ee candle; but,
      as 'tis Christmas week, and the time that folks have hollerdays, you can
      enjoy yerself by falling asleep a bit in the chair instead of biding awake
      all the time. But mind, not longer at once than while the shade of the
      Devil's Door moves a couple of spans, for you must keep an eye upon the
      ewes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy made no definite reply, and the old man, stirring the fire in the
      stove with his crook-stem, closed the door upon his companion and
      vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      As this had been more or less the course of events every night since the
      season's lambing had set in, the boy was not at all surprised at the
      charge, and amused himself for some time by lighting straws at the stove.
      He then went out to the ewes and new-born lambs, re-entered, sat down, and
      finally fell asleep. This was his customary manner of performing his
      watch, for though special permission for naps had this week been accorded,
      he had, as a matter of fact, done the same thing on every preceding night,
      sleeping often till awakened by a smack on the shoulder at three or four
      in the morning from the crook-stem of the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      It might have been about eleven o'clock when he awoke. He was so surprised
      at awaking without, apparently, being called or struck, that on second
      thoughts he assumed that somebody must have called him in spite of
      appearances, and looked out of the hut window towards the sheep. They all
      lay as quiet as when he had visited them, very little bleating being
      audible, and no human soul disturbing the scene. He next looked from the
      opposite window, and here the case was different. The frost-facets
      glistened under the moon as before; an occasional furze bush showed as a
      dark spot on the same; and in the foreground stood the ghostly form of the
      trilithon. But in front of the trilithon stood a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      That he was not the shepherd or any one of the farm labourers was apparent
      in a moment's observation,-his dress being a dark suit, and his figure of
      slender build and graceful carriage. He walked backwards and forwards in
      front of the trilithon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shepherd lad had hardly done speculating on the strangeness of the
      unknown's presence here at such an hour, when he saw a second figure
      crossing the open sward towards the locality of the trilithon and furze-
      clump that screened the hut. This second personage was a woman; and
      immediately on sight of her the male stranger hastened forward, meeting
      her just in front of the hut window. Before she seemed to be aware of his
      intention he clasped her in his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady released herself and drew back with some dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You have come, Harriet-bless you for it!' he exclaimed, fervently.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But not for this,' she answered, in offended accents. And then, more
      good-naturedly, 'I have come, Fred, because you entreated me so! What can
      have been the object of your writing such a letter? I feared I might be
      doing you grievous ill by staying away. How did you come here?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I walked all the way from my father's.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, what is it? How have you lived since we last met?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But roughly; you might have known that without asking. I have seen many
      lands and many faces since I last walked these downs, but I have only
      thought of you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is it only to tell me this that you have summoned me so strangely?'
    </p>
    <p>
      A passing breeze blew away the murmur of the reply and several succeeding
      sentences, till the man's voice again became audible in the words,
      'Harriet-truth between us two! I have heard that the Duke does not treat
      you too well.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He is warm-tempered, but he is a good husband.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He speaks roughly to you, and sometimes even threatens to lock you out of
      doors.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Only once, Fred! On my honour, only once. The Duke is a fairly good
      husband, I repeat. But you deserve punishment for this night's trick of
      drawing me out. What does it mean?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Harriet, dearest, is this fair or honest? Is it not notorious that your
      life with him is a sad one-that, in spite of the sweetness of your temper,
      the sourness of his embitters your days. I have come to know if I can help
      you. You are a Duchess, and I am Fred Ogbourne; but it is not impossible
      that I may be able to help you . . . By God! the sweetness of that tongue
      ought to keep him civil, especially when there is added to it the
      sweetness of that face!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Captain Ogbourne!' she exclaimed, with an emphasis of playful fear. 'How
      can such a comrade of my youth behave to me as you do? Don't speak so, and
      stare at me so! Is this really all you have to say? I see I ought not to
      have come. 'Twas thoughtlessly done.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Another breeze broke the thread of discourse for a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very well. I perceive you are dead and lost to me,' he could next be
      heard to say, '"Captain Ogbourne" proves that. As I once loved you I love
      you now, Harriet, without one jot of abatement; but you are not the woman
      you were-you once were honest towards me; and now you conceal your heart
      in made-up speeches. Let it be: I can never see you again.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You need not say that in such a tragedy tone, you silly. You may see me
      in an ordinary way-why should you not? But, of course, not in such a way
      as this. I should not have come now, if it had not happened that the Duke
      is away from home, so that there is nobody to check my erratic impulses.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'When does he return?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The day after to-morrow, or the day after that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then meet me again to-morrow night.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, Fred, I cannot.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If you cannot to-morrow night, you can the night after; one of the two
      before he comes please bestow on me. Now, your hand upon it! To-morrow or
      next night you will see me to bid me farewell!' He seized the Duchess's
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, but Fred-let go my hand! What do you mean by holding me so? If it be
      love to forget all respect to a woman's present position in thinking of
      her past, then yours may be so, Frederick. It is not kind and gentle of
      you to induce me to come to this place for pity of you, and then to hold
      me tight here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But see me once more! I have come two thousand miles to ask it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, I must not! There will be slanders-Heaven knows what! I cannot meet
      you. For the sake of old times don't ask it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then own two things to me; that you did love me once, and that your
      husband is unkind to you often enough now to make you think of the time
      when you cared for me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes-I own them both,' she answered faintly. 'But owning such as that
      tells against me; and I swear the inference is not true.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't say that; for you have come-let me think the reason of your coming
      what I like to think it. It can do you no harm. Come once more!'
    </p>
    <p>
      He still held her hand and waist. 'Very well, then,' she said. 'Thus far
      you shall persuade me. I will meet you to-morrow night or the night after.
      Now, let me go.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He released her, and they parted. The Duchess ran rapidly down the hill
      towards the outlying mansion of Shakeforest Towers, and when he had
      watched her out of sight, he turned and strode off in the opposite
      direction. All then was silent and empty as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet it was only for a moment. When they had quite departed, another shape
      appeared upon the scene. He came from behind the trilithon. He was a man
      of stouter build than the first, and wore the boots and spurs of a
      horseman. Two things were at once obvious from this phenomenon: that he
      had watched the interview between the Captain and the Duchess; and that,
      though he probably had seen every movement of the couple, including the
      embrace, he had been too remote to hear the reluctant words of the lady's
      conversation-or, indeed, any words at all-so that the meeting must have
      exhibited itself to his eye as the assignation of a pair of well-agreed
      lovers. But it was necessary that several years should elapse before the
      shepherd-boy was old enough to reason out this.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third individual stood still for a moment, as if deep in meditation.
      He crossed over to where the lady and gentleman had stood, and looked at
      the ground; then he too turned and went away in a third direction, as
      widely divergent as possible from those taken by the two interlocutors.
      His course was towards the highway; and a few minutes afterwards the trot
      of a horse might have been heard upon its frosty surface, lessening till
      it died away upon the ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy remained in the hut, confronting the trilithon as if he expected
      yet more actors on the scene, but nobody else appeared. How long he stood
      with his little face against the loophole he hardly knew; but he was
      rudely awakened from his reverie by a punch in his back, and in the feel
      of it he familiarly recognized the stem of the old shepherd's crook.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Blame thy young eyes and limbs, Bill Mills-now you have let the fire out,
      and you know I want it kept in! I thought something would go wrong with
      'ee up here, and I couldn't bide in bed no more than thistledown on the
      wind, that I could not! Well, what's happened, fie upon 'ee?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nothing.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ewes all as I left 'em?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Any lambs want bringing in?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The shepherd relit the fire, and went out among the sheep with a lantern,
      for the moon was getting low. Soon he came in again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Blame it all-thou'st say that nothing have happened; when one ewe have
      twinned and is like to go off, and another is dying for want of half an
      eye of looking to! I told 'ee, Bill Mills, if anything went wrong to come
      down and call me; and this is how you have done it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You said I could go to sleep for a hollerday, and I did.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't you speak to your betters like that, young man, or you'll come to
      the gallows-tree! You didn't sleep all the time, or you wouldn't have been
      peeping out of that there hole! Now you can go home, and be up here again
      by breakfast-time. I be an old man, and there's old men that deserve well
      of the world; but no I-must rest how I can!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The elder shepherd then lay down inside the hut, and the boy went down the
      hill to the hamlet where he dwelt. SECOND NIGHT
    </p>
    <p>
      When the next night drew on the actions of the boy were almost enough to
      show that he was thinking of the meeting he had witnessed, and of the
      promise wrung from the lady that she would come there again. As far as the
      sheep-tending arrangements were concerned, to-night was but a repetition
      of the foregoing one. Between ten and eleven o'clock the old shepherd
      withdrew as usual for what sleep at home he might chance to get without
      interruption, making up the other necessary hours of rest at some time
      during the day; the boy was left alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The frost was the same as on the night before, except perhaps that it was
      a little more severe. The moon shone as usual, except that it was
      three-quarters of an hour later in its course; and the boy's condition was
      much the same, except that he felt no sleepiness whatever. He felt, too,
      rather afraid; but upon the whole he preferred witnessing an assignation
      of strangers to running the risk of being discovered absent by the old
      shepherd.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was before the distant clock of Shakeforest Towers had struck eleven
      that he observed the opening of the second act of this midnight drama. It
      consisted in the appearance of neither lover nor Duchess, but of the third
      figure-the stout man, booted and spurred-who came up from the easterly
      direction in which he had retreated the night before. He walked once round
      the trilithon, and next advanced towards the clump concealing the hut, the
      moonlight shining full upon his face and revealing him to be the Duke.
      Fear seized upon the shepherd-boy: the Duke was Jove himself to the rural
      population, whom to offend was starvation, homelessness, and death, and
      whom to look at was to be mentally scathed and dumbfoundered. He closed
      the stove, so that not a spark of light appeared, and hastily buried
      himself in the straw that lay in a corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke came close to the clump of furze and stood by the spot where his
      wife and the Captain had held their dialogue; he examined the furze as if
      searching for a hiding-place, and in doing so discovered the hut. The
      latter he walked round and then looked inside; finding it to all seeming
      empty, he entered, closing the door behind him and taking his place at the
      little circular window against which the boy's face had been pressed just
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke had not adopted his measures too rapidly, if his object were
      concealment. Almost as soon as he had stationed himself there eleven
      o'clock struck, and the slender young man who had previously graced the
      scene promptly reappeared from the north quarter of the down. The spot of
      assignation having, by the accident of his running forward on the
      foregoing night, removed itself from the Devil's Door to the clump of
      furze, he instinctively came thither, and waited for the Duchess where he
      had met her before.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a fearful surprise was in store for him to-night, as well as for the
      trembling juvenile. At his appearance the Duke breathed more and more
      quickly, his breathings being distinctly audible to the crouching boy. The
      young man had hardly paused when the alert nobleman softly opened the door
      of the hut, and, stepping round the furze, came full upon Captain Fred.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You have dishonoured her, and you shall die the death you deserve!' came
      to the shepherd's ears, in a harsh, hollow whisper through the boarding of
      the hut.
    </p>
    <p>
      The apathetic and taciturn boy was excited enough to run the risk of
      rising and looking from the window, but he could see nothing for the
      intervening furze boughs, both the men having gone round to the side. What
      took place in the few following moments he never exactly knew. He
      discerned portion of a shadow in quick muscular movement; then there was
      the fall of something on the grass; then there was stillness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two or three minutes later the Duke became visible round the corner of the
      hut, dragging by the collar the now inert body of the second man. The Duke
      dragged him across the open space towards the trilithon. Behind this ruin
      was a hollow, irregular spot, overgrown with furze and stunted thorns, and
      riddled by the old holes of badgers, its former inhabitants, who had now
      died out or departed. The Duke vanished into this depression with his
      burden, reappearing after the lapse of a few seconds. When he came forth
      he dragged nothing behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He returned to the side of the hut, cleansed something on the grass, and
      again put himself on the watch, though not as before, inside the hut, but
      without, on the shady side. 'Now for the second!' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was plain, even to the unsophisticated boy, that he now awaited the
      other person of the appointment-his wife, the Duchess-for what purpose it
      was terrible to think. He seemed to be a man of such determined temper
      that he would scarcely hesitate in carrying out a course of revenge to the
      bitter end. Moreover-though it was what the shepherd did not perceive-this
      was all the more probable, in that the moody Duke was labouring under the
      exaggerated impression which the sight of the meeting in dumb show had
      conveyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The jealous watcher waited long, but he waited in vain. From within the
      hut the boy could hear his occasional exclamations of surprise, as if he
      were almost disappointed at the failure of his assumption that his guilty
      Duchess would surely keep the tryst. Sometimes he stepped from the shade
      of the furze into the moonlight, and held up his watch to learn the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      About half-past eleven he seemed to give up expecting her. He then went a
      second time to the hollow behind the trilithon, remaining there nearly a
      quarter of an hour. From this place he proceeded quickly over a shoulder
      of the declivity, a little to the left, presently returning on horseback,
      which proved that his horse had been tethered in some secret place down
      there. Crossing anew the down between the hut and the trilithon, and
      scanning the precincts as if finally to assure himself that she had not
      come, he rode slowly downwards in the direction of Shakeforest Towers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The juvenile shepherd thought of what lay in the hollow yonder; and no
      fear of the crook-stem of his superior officer was potent enough to detain
      him longer on that hill alone. Any live company, even the most terrible,
      was better than the company of the dead; so, running with the speed of a
      hare in the direction pursued by the horseman, he overtook the revengeful
      Duke at the second descent (where the great western road crossed before
      you came to the old park entrance on that side-now closed up and the lodge
      cleared away, though at the time it was wondered why, being considered the
      most convenient gate of all).
    </p>
    <p>
      Once within the sound of the horse's footsteps, Bill Mills felt
      comparatively comfortable; for, though in awe of the Duke because of his
      position, he had no moral repugnance to his companionship on account of
      the grisly deed he had committed, considering that powerful nobleman to
      have a right to do what he chose on his own lands. The Duke rode steadily
      on beneath his ancestral trees, the hoofs of his horse sending up a smart
      sound now that he had reached the hard road of the drive, and soon drew
      near the front door of his house, surmounted by parapets with square-cut
      battlements that cast a notched shade upon the gravelled terrace. These
      outlines were quite familiar to little Bill Mills, though nothing within
      their boundary had ever been seen by him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the rider approached the mansion a small turret door was quickly
      opened and a woman came out. As soon as she saw the horseman's outlines
      she ran forward into the moonlight to meet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah dear-and are you come?' she said. 'I heard Hero's tread just when you
      rode over the hill, and I knew it in a moment. I would have come further
      if I had been aware-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Glad to see me, eh?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How can you ask that?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well; it is a lovely night for meetings.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, it is a lovely night.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke dismounted and stood by her side. 'Why should you have been
      listening at this time of night, and yet not expecting me?' he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, indeed! There is a strange story attached to that, which I must tell
      you at once. But why did you come a night sooner than you said you would
      come? I am rather sorry-I really am!' (shaking her head playfully) 'for as
      a surprise to you I had ordered a bonfire to be built, which was to be
      lighted on your arrival to-morrow; and now it is wasted. You can see the
      outline of it just out there.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke looked across to a spot of rising glade, and saw the faggots in a
      heap. He then bent his eyes with a bland and puzzled air on the ground,
      'What is this strange story you have to tell me that kept you awake?' he
      murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is this-and it is really rather serious. My cousin Fred
      Ogbourne-Captain Ogbourne as he is now-was in his boyhood a great admirer
      of mine, as I think I have told you, though I was six years his senior. In
      strict truth, he was absurdly fond of me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You have never told me of that before.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then it was your sister I told-yes, it was. Well, you know I have not
      seen him for many years, and naturally I had quite forgotten his
      admiration of me in old times. But guess my surprise when the day before
      yesterday, I received a mysterious note bearing no address, and found on
      opening it that it came from him. The contents frightened me out of my
      wits. He had returned from Canada to his father's house, and conjured me
      by all he could think of to meet him at once. But I think I can repeat the
      exact words, though I will show it to you when we get indoors.
    </p>
    <p>
      "MY DEAR COUSIN HARRIET," the note said, "After this long absence you will
      be surprised at my sudden reappearance, and more by what I am going to
      ask. But if my life and future are of any concern to you at all, I beg
      that you will grant my request. What I require of you, is, dear Harriet,
      that you meet me about eleven to-night by the Druid stones on Marlbury
      Downs, about a mile or more from your house. I cannot say more, except to
      entreat you to come. I will explain all when you are there. The one thing
      is, I want to see you. Come alone. Believe me, I would not ask this if my
      happiness did not hang upon it-God knows how entirely! I am too agitated
      to say more-Yours. FRED."
    </p>
    <p>
      'That was all of it. Now, of course I ought have gone, as it turned out,
      but that I did not think of then. I remembered his impetuous temper, and
      feared that something grievous was impending over his head, while he had
      not a friend in the world to help him, or any one except myself to whom he
      would care to make his trouble known. So I wrapped myself up and went to
      Marlbury Downs at the time he had named. Don't you think I was
      courageous?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'When I got there-but shall we not walk on; it is getting cold?' The Duke,
      however, did not move. 'When I got there he came, of course, as a full
      grown man and officer, and not as the lad that I had known him. When I saw
      him I was sorry I had come. I can hardly tell you how he behaved. What he
      wanted I don't know even now; it seemed to be no more than the mere
      meeting with me. He held me by the hand and waist-O so tight-and would not
      let me go till I had promised to meet him again. His manner was so strange
      and passionate that I was afraid of him in such a lonely place, and I
      promised to come. Then I escaped-then I ran home-and that's all. When the
      time drew on this evening for the appointment-which, of course, I never
      intended to keep, I felt uneasy, lest when he found I meant to disappoint
      him he would come on to the house; and that's why I could not sleep. But
      you are so silent!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have had a long journey.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then let us get into the house. Why did you come alone and unattended
      like this?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It was my humour.'
    </p>
    <p>
      After a moment's silence, during which they moved on, she said, 'I have
      thought of something which I hardly like to suggest to you. He said that
      if I failed to come to-night he would wait again to-morrow night. Now,
      shall we to-morrow night go to the hill together-just to see if he is
      there; and if he is, read him a lesson on his foolishness in nourishing
      this old passion, and sending for me so oddly, instead of coming to the
      house?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why should we see if he's there?' said her husband moodily.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Because I think we ought to do something in it. Poor Fred! He would
      listen to you if you reasoned with him, and set our positions in their
      true light before him. It would be no more than Christian kindness to a
      man who unquestionably is very miserable from some cause or other. His
      head seems quite turned.'
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time they had reached the door, rung the bell, and waited. All the
      house seemed to be asleep; but soon a man came to them, the horse was
      taken away, and the Duke and Duchess went in. THIRD NIGHT
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no help for it. Bill Mills was obliged to stay on duty, in the
      old shepherd's absence, this evening as before, or give up his post and
      living. He thought as bravely as he could of what lay behind the Devil's
      Door, but with no great success, and was therefore in a measure relieved,
      even if awe-stricken, when he saw the forms of the Duke and Duchess
      strolling across the frosted greensward. The Duchess was a few yards in
      front of her husband and tripped on lightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I tell you he has not thought it worth while to come again!' the Duke
      insisted, as he stood still, reluctant to walk further.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He is more likely to come and wait all night; and it would be harsh
      treatment to let him do it a second time.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He is not here; so turn and come home.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He seems not to be here, certainly; I wonder if anything has happened to
      him. If it has, I shall never forgive myself!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke, uneasily, 'O, no. He has some other engagement.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That is very unlikely.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Or perhaps he has found the distance too far.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nor is that probable.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then he may have thought better of it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, he may have thought better of it; if, indeed, he is not here all the
      time-somewhere in the hollow behind the Devil's Door. Let us go and see;
      it will serve him right to surprise him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, he's not there.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He may be lying very quiet because of you,' she said archly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, no-not because of me!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Come, then. I declare, dearest, you lag like an unwilling schoolboy
      to-night, and there's no responsiveness in you! You are jealous of that
      poor lad, and it is quite absurd of you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll come! I'll come! Say no more, Harriet!' And they crossed over the
      green.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wondering what they would do, the young shepherd left the hut, and doubled
      behind the belt of furze, intending to stand near the trilithon
      unperceived. But, in crossing the few yards of open ground he was for a
      moment exposed to view.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, I see him at last!' said the Duchess.
    </p>
    <p>
      'See him!' said the Duke. 'Where?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'By the Devil's Door; don't you notice a figure there? Ah, my poor
      lover-cousin, won't you catch it now?' And she laughed half-pityingly.
      'But what's the matter?' she asked, turning to her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is not he!' said the Duke hoarsely. 'It can't be he!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, it is not he. It is too small for him. It is a boy.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, I thought so! Boy, come here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The youthful shepherd advanced with apprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What are you doing here?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Keeping sheep, your Grace.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, you know me! Do you keep sheep here every night?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Off and on, my Lord Duke.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And what have you seen here to-night or last night?' inquired the
      Duchess. 'Any person waiting or walking about?'
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He has seen nothing,' interrupted her husband, his eyes so forbiddingly
      fixed on the boy that they seemed to shine like points of fire. 'Come, let
      us go. The air is too keen to stand in long.'
    </p>
    <p>
      When they were gone the boy retreated to the hut and sheep, less fearful
      now than at first-familiarity with the situation having gradually
      overpowered his thoughts of the buried man. But he was not to be left
      alone long. When an interval had elapsed of about sufficient length for
      walking to and from Shakeforest Towers, there appeared from that direction
      the heavy form of the Duke. He now came alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nobleman, on his part, seemed to have eyes no less sharp than the
      boy's, for he instantly recognized the latter among the ewes, and came
      straight towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Are you the shepherd lad I spoke to a short time ago?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I be, my Lord Duke.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now listen to me. Her Grace asked you what you had seen this last night
      or two up here, and you made no reply. I now ask the same thing, and you
      need not be afraid to answer. Have you seen anything strange these nights
      you have been watching here?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'My Lord Duke, I be a poor heedless boy, and what I see I don't bear in
      mind.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I ask you again,' said the Duke, coming nearer, 'have you seen anything
      strange these nights you have been watching here?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, my Lord Duke! I be but the under-shepherd boy, and my father he was
      but your humble Grace's hedger, and my mother only the cinder-woman in the
      back-yard! I fall asleep when left alone, and I see nothing at all!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke grasped the boy by the shoulder, and, directly impending over
      him, stared down into his face, 'Did you see anything strange done here
      last night, I say?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, my Lord Duke, have mercy, and don't stab me!' cried the shepherd,
      falling on his knees. 'I have never seen you walking here, or riding here,
      or lying-in-wait for a man, or dragging a heavy load!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'H'm!' said his interrogator, grimly, relaxing his hold. 'It is well to
      know that you have never seen those things. Now, which would you
      rather-see me do those things now, or keep a secret all your life?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Keep a secret, my Lord Duke!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sure you are able?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, your Grace, try me!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very well. And now, how do you like sheep-keeping?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not at all. 'Tis lonely work for them that think of spirits, and I'm
      badly used.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I believe you. You are too young for it. I must do something to make you
      more comfortable. You shall change this smock-frock for a real cloth
      jacket, and your thick boots for polished shoes. And you shall be taught
      what you have never yet heard of; and be put to school, and have bats and
      balls for the holidays, and be made a man of. But you must never say you
      have been a shepherd boy, and watched on the hills at night, for shepherd
      boys are not liked in good company.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Trust me, my Lord Duke.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The very moment you forget yourself, and speak of your shepherd days-this
      year, next year, in school, out of school, or riding in your carriage
      twenty years hence-at that moment my help will be withdrawn, and smash
      down you come to shepherding forthwith. You have parents, I think you
      say?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A widowed mother only, my Lord Duke.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll provide for her, and make a comfortable woman of her, until you
      speak of-what?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of my shepherd days, and what I saw here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good. If you do speak of it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Smash down she comes to widowing forthwith!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's well-very well. But it's not enough. Come here.' He took the boy
      across to the trilithon, and made him kneel down.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now, this was once a holy place,' resumed the Duke. 'An altar stood here,
      erected to a venerable family of gods, who were known and talked of long
      before the God we know now. So that an oath sworn here is doubly an oath.
      Say this after me: "May all the host above-angels and archangels, and
      principalities and powers-punish me; may I be tormented wherever I am-in
      the house or in the garden, in the fields or in the roads, in church or in
      chapel, at home or abroad, on land or at sea; may I be afflicted in eating
      and in drinking, in growing up and in growing old, in living and dying,
      inwardly and outwardly, and for always, if I ever speak of my life as a
      shepherd boy, or of what I have seen done on this Marlbury Down. So be it,
      and so let it be. Amen and amen." Now kiss the stone.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The trembling boy repeated the words, and kissed the stone, as desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke led him off by the hand. That night the junior shepherd slept in
      Shakeforest Towers, and the next day he was sent away for tuition to a
      remote village. Thence he went to a preparatory establishment, and in due
      course to a public school. FOURTH NIGHT
    </p>
    <p>
      On a winter evening many years subsequent to the above-mentioned
      occurrences, the ci-devant shepherd sat in a well-furnished office in the
      north wing of Shakeforest Towers in the guise of an ordinary educated man
      of business. He appeared at this time as a person of thirty-eight or
      forty, though actually he was several years younger. A worn and restless
      glance of the eye now and then, when he lifted his head to search for some
      letter or paper which had been mislaid, seemed to denote that his was not
      a mind so thoroughly at ease as his surroundings might have led an
      observer to expect.
    </p>
    <p>
      His pallor, too, was remarkable for a countryman. He was professedly
      engaged in writing, but he shaped not word. He had sat there only a few
      minutes, when, laying down his pen and pushing back his chair, he rested a
      hand uneasily on each of the chair-arms and looked on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon he arose and left the room. His course was along a passage which
      ended in a central octagonal hall; crossing this he knocked at a door. A
      faint, though deep, voice told him to come in. The room he entered was the
      library, and it was tenanted by a single person only-his patron the Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this long interval of years the Duke had lost all his heaviness of
      build. He was, indeed, almost a skeleton; his white hair was thin, and his
      hands were nearly transparent. 'Oh-Mills?' he murmured. 'Sit down. What is
      it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nothing new, your Grace. Nobody to speak of has written, and nobody has
      called.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah-what then? You look concerned.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Old times have come to life, owing to something waking them.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Old times be cursed-which old times are they?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That Christmas week twenty-two years ago, when the late Duchess's cousin
      Frederick implored her to meet him on Marlbury Downs. I saw the meeting-it
      was just such a night as this-and I, as you know, saw more. She met him
      once, but not the second time.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mills, shall I recall some words to you-the words of an oath taken on
      that hill by a shepherd-boy?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is unnecessary. He has strenuously kept that oath and promise. Since
      that night no sound of his shepherd life has crossed his lips-even to
      yourself. But do you wish to hear more, or do you not, your Grace?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I wish to hear no more,' said the Duke sullenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very well; let it be so. But a time seems coming-may be quite near at
      hand-when, in spite of my lips, that episode will allow itself to go
      undivulged no longer.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I wish to hear no more!' repeated the Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You need be under no fear of treachery from me,' said the steward,
      somewhat bitterly. 'I am a man to whom you have been kind-no patron could
      have been kinder. You have clothed and educated me; have installed me
      here; and I am not unmindful. But what of it-has your Grace gained much by
      my stanchness? I think not. There was great excitement about Captain
      Ogbourne's disappearance, but I spoke not a word. And his body has never
      been found. For twenty-two years I have wondered what you did with him.
      Now I know. A circumstance that occurred this afternoon recalled the time
      to me most forcibly. To make it certain to myself that all was not a
      dream, I went up there with a spade; I searched, and saw enough to know
      that something decays there in a closed badger's hole.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mills, do you think the Duchess guessed?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She never did, I am sure, to the day of her death.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Did you leave all as you found it on the hill?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I did.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What made you think of going up there this particular afternoon?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What your Grace says you don't wish to be told.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke was silent; and the stillness of the evening was so marked that
      there reached their ears from the outer air the sound of a tolling bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What is that bell tolling for?' asked the nobleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      'For what I came to tell you of, your Grace.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You torment me it is your way!' said the Duke querulously. 'Who's dead in
      the village?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The oldest man-the old shepherd.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dead at last-how old is he?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ninety-four.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And I am only seventy. I have four-and-twenty years to the good!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I served under that old man when I kept sheep on Marlbury Downs. And he
      was on the hill that second night, when I first exchanged words with your
      Grace. He was on the hill all the time; but I did not know he was
      there-nor did you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah!' said the Duke, starting up. 'Go on-I yield the point-you may tell!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I heard this afternoon that he was at the point of death. It was that
      which set me thinking of that past time-and induced me to search on the
      hill for what I have told you. Coming back I heard that he wished to see
      the Vicar to confess to him a secret he had kept for more than twenty
      years-"out of respect to my Lord the Duke"-something that he had seen
      committed on Marlbury Downs when returning to the flock on a December
      night twenty-two years ago. I have thought it over. He had left me in
      charge that evening; but he was in the habit of coming back suddenly, lest
      I should have fallen asleep. That night I saw nothing of him, though he
      had promised to return. He must have returned, and-found reason to keep in
      hiding. It is all plain. The next thing is that the Vicar went to him two
      hours ago. Further than that I have not heard.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is quite enough. I will see the Vicar at daybreak to-morrow.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What to do?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Stop his tongue for four-and-twenty years-till I am dead at ninety- four,
      like the shepherd.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Your Grace-while you impose silence on me, I will not speak, even though
      nay neck should pay the penalty. I promised to be yours, and I am yours.
      But is this persistence of any avail?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll stop his tongue, I say!' cried the Duke with some of his old rugged
      force. 'Now, you go home to bed, Mills, and leave me to manage him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The interview ended, and the steward withdrew. The night, as he had said,
      was just such an one as the night of twenty-two years before, and the
      events of the evening destroyed in him all regard for the season as one of
      cheerfulness and goodwill. He went off to his own house on the further
      verge of the park, where he led a lonely life, scarcely calling any man
      friend. At eleven he prepared to retire to bed-but did not retire. He sat
      down and reflected. Twelve o'clock struck; he looked out at the colourless
      moon, and, prompted by he knew not what, put on his hat and emerged into
      the air. Here William Mills strolled on and on, till he reached the top of
      Marlbury Downs, a spot he had not visited at this hour of the night during
      the whole score-and-odd years.
    </p>
    <p>
      He placed himself, as nearly as he could guess, on the spot where the
      shepherd's hut had stood. No lambing was in progress there now, and the
      old shepherd who had used him so roughly had ceased from his labours that
      very day. But the trilithon stood up white as ever; and, crossing the
      intervening sward, the steward fancifully placed his mouth against the
      stone. Restless and self-reproachful as he was, he could not resist a
      smile as he thought of the terrifying oath of compact, sealed by a kiss
      upon the stones of a Pagan temple. But he had kept his word, rather as a
      promise than as a formal vow, with much worldly advantage to himself,
      though not much happiness; till increase of years had bred reactionary
      feelings which led him to receive the news of to-night with emotions akin
      to relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      While leaning against the Devil's Door and thinking on these things, he
      became conscious that he was not the only inhabitant of the down. A figure
      in white was moving across his front with long, noiseless strides. Mills
      stood motionless, and when the form drew quite near he perceived it to be
      that of the Duke himself in his nightshirt-apparently walking in his
      sleep. Not to alarm the old man, Mills clung close to the shadow of the
      stone. The Duke went straight on into the hollow. There he knelt down, and
      began scratching the earth with his hands like a badger. After a few
      minutes he arose, sighed heavily, and retraced his steps as he had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fearing that he might harm himself, yet unwilling to arouse him, the
      steward followed noiselessly. The Duke kept on his path unerringly,
      entered the park, and made for the house, where he let himself in by a
      window that stood open-the one probably by which he had come out. Mills
      softly closed the window behind his patron, and then retired homeward to
      await the revelations of the morning, deeming it unnecessary to alarm the
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, he felt uneasy during the remainder of the night, no less on
      account of the Duke's personal condition than because of that which was
      imminent next day. Early in the morning he called at Shakeforest Towers.
      The blinds were down, and there was something singular upon the porter's
      face when he opened the door. The steward inquired for the Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man's voice was subdued as he replied: 'Sir, I am sorry to say that
      his Grace is dead! He left his room some time in the night, and wandered
      about nobody knows where. On returning to the upper floor he lost his
      balance and fell downstairs.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The steward told the tale of the Down before the Vicar had spoken. Mills
      had always intended to do so after the death of the Duke. The consequences
      to himself he underwent cheerfully; but his life was not prolonged. He
      died, a farmer at the Cape, when still somewhat under forty-nine years of
      age.
    </p>
    <p>
      The splendid Marlbury breeding flock is as renowned as ever, and, to the
      eye, seems the same in every particular that it was in earlier times; but
      the animals which composed it on the occasion of the events gathered from
      the Justice are divided by many ovine generations from its members now.
      Lambing Corner has long since ceased to be used for lambing purposes,
      though the name still lingers on as the appellation of the spot. This
      abandonment of site may be partly owing to the removal of the high furze
      bushes which lent such convenient shelter at that date. Partly, too, it
      may be due to another circumstance. For it is said by present shepherds in
      that district that during the nights of Christmas week flitting shapes are
      seen in the open space around the trilithon, together with the gleam of a
      weapon, and the shadow of a man dragging a burden into the hollow. But of
      these things there is no certain testimony.
    </p>

    <h2>
      A COMMITTEE-MAN OF 'THE TERROR'
    </h2>
    <p>
      We had been talking of the Georgian glories of our old-fashioned
      watering-place, which now, with its substantial russet-red and dun brick
      buildings in the style of the year eighteen hundred, looks like one side
      of a Soho or Bloomsbury Street transported to the shore, and draws a smile
      from the modern tourist who has no eye for solidity of build. The writer,
      quite a youth, was present merely as a listener. The conversation
      proceeded from general subjects to particular, until old Mrs. H&mdash;,
      whose memory was as perfect at eighty as it had ever been in her life,
      interested us all by the obvious fidelity with which she repeated a story
      many times related to her by her mother when our aged friend was a girl-a
      domestic drama much affecting the life of an acquaintance of her said
      parent, one Mademoiselle V&mdash;, a teacher of French. The incidents
      occurred in the town during the heyday of its fortunes, at the time of our
      brief peace with France in 1802-3.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I wrote it down in the shape of a story some years ago, just after my
      mother's death,' said Mrs. H&mdash;. 'It is locked up in my desk there
      now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Read it!' said we.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No,' said she; 'the light is bad, and I can remember it well enough, word
      for word, flourishes and all.' We could not be choosers in the
      circumstances, and she began.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      'There are two in it, of course, the man and the woman, and it was on an
      evening in September that she first got to know him. There had not been
      such a grand gathering on the Esplanade all the season. His Majesty King
      George the Third was present, with all the princesses and royal dukes,
      while upwards of three hundred of the general nobility and other persons
      of distinction were also in the town at the time. Carriages and other
      conveyances were arriving every minute from London and elsewhere; and when
      among the rest a shabby stage-coach came in by a by-route along the coast
      from Havenpool, and drew up at a second-rate tavern, it attracted
      comparatively little notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      'From this dusty vehicle a man alighted, left his small quantity of
      luggage temporarily at the office, and walked along the street as if to
      look for lodgings.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He was about forty-five-possibly fifty-and wore a long coat of faded
      superfine cloth, with a heavy collar, and a hunched-up neckcloth. He
      seemed to desire obscurity.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But the display appeared presently to strike him, and he asked of a
      rustic he met in the street what was going on; his accent being that of
      one to whom English pronunciation was difficult.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The countryman looked at him with a slight surprise, and said, "King
      Jarge is here and his royal Cwort."
    </p>
    <p>
      'The stranger inquired if they were going to stay long.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Don't know, Sir. Same as they always do, I suppose."
    </p>
    <p>
      '"How long is that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Till some time in October. They've come here every summer since
      eighty-nine."
    </p>
    <p>
      'The stranger moved onward down St. Thomas Street, and approached the
      bridge over the harbour backwater, that then, as now, connected the old
      town with the more modern portion. The spot was swept with the rays of a
      low sun, which lit up the harbour lengthwise, and shone under the brim of
      the man's hat and into his eyes as he looked westward. Against the
      radiance figures were crossing in the opposite direction to his own; among
      them this lady of my mother's later acquaintance, Mademoiselle V&mdash; .
      She was the daughter of a good old French family, and at that date a pale
      woman, twenty-eight or thirty years of age, tall and elegant in figure,
      but plainly dressed and wearing that evening (she said) a small muslin
      shawl crossed over the bosom in the fashion of the time, and tied behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      'At sight of his face, which, as she used to tell us, was unusually
      distinct in the peering sunlight, she could not help giving a little
      shriek of horror, for a terrible reason connected with her history, and
      after walking a few steps further, she sank down against the parapet of
      the bridge in a fainting fit.
    </p>
    <p>
      'In his preoccupation the foreign gentleman had hardly noticed her, but
      her strange collapse immediately attracted his attention. He quickly
      crossed the carriageway, picked her up, and carried her into the first
      shop adjoining the bridge, explaining that she was a lady who had been
      taken ill outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      'She soon revived; but, clearly much puzzled, her helper perceived that
      she still had a dread of him which was sufficient to hinder her complete
      recovery of self-command. She spoke in a quick and nervous way to the
      shopkeeper, asking him to call a coach.
    </p>
    <p>
      'This the shopkeeper did, Mademoiselle V&mdash;- and the stranger
      remaining in constrained silence while he was gone. The coach came up, and
      giving the man the address, she entered it and drove away.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Who is that lady?" said the newly arrived gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"She's of your nation, as I should make bold to suppose," said the
      shopkeeper. And he told the other that she was Mademoiselle V&mdash;,
      governess at General Newbold's, in the same town.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"You have many foreigners here?" the stranger inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Yes, though mostly Hanoverians. But since the peace they are learning
      French a good deal in genteel society, and French instructors are rather
      in demand."
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Yes, I teach it," said the visitor. "I am looking for a tutorship in an
      academy."
    </p>

      'The information given by the burgess to the Frenchman seemed to explain
      to the latter nothing of his countrywoman's conduct-which, indeed, was the
      case-and he left the shop, taking his course again over the bridge and
      along the south quay to the Old Rooms Inn, where he engaged a bedchamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Thoughts of the woman who had betrayed such agitation at sight of him
      lingered naturally enough with the newcomer. Though, as I stated, not much
      less than thirty years of age, Mademoiselle V&mdash;, one of his own
      nation, and of highly refined and delicate appearance, had kindled a
      singular interest in the middle-aged gentleman's breast, and her large
      dark eyes, as they had opened and shrunk from him, exhibited a pathetic
      beauty to which hardly any man could have been insensible.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The next day, having written some letters, he went out and made known at
      the office of the town "Guide" and of the newspaper, that a teacher of
      French and calligraphy had arrived, leaving a card at the bookseller's to
      the same effect. He then walked on aimlessly, but at length inquired the
      way to General Newbold's. At the door, without giving his name, he asked
      to see Mademoiselle V&mdash;, and was shown into a little back parlour,
      where she came to him with a gaze of surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"My God! Why do you intrude here, Monsieur?" she gasped in French as soon
      as she saw his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"You were taken ill yesterday. I helped you. You might have been run over
      if I had not picked you up. It was an act of simple humanity certainly;
      but I thought I might come to ask if you had recovered?"
    </p>
    <p>
      'She had turned aside, and had scarcely heard a word of his speech. "I
      hate you, infamous man!" she said. "I cannot bear your helping me. Go
      away!"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"But you are a stranger to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      '"I know you too well!"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"You have the advantage then, Mademoiselle. I am a newcomer here. I never
      have seen you before to my knowledge; and I certainly do not, could not,
      hate you."
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Are you not Monsieur B&mdash;?"
    </p>
    <p>
      'He flinched. "I am-in Paris," he said. "But here I am Monsieur G&mdash;."
    </p>
    <p>
      '"That is trivial. You are the man I say you are."
    </p>
    <p>
      '"How did you know my real name, Mademoiselle?"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"I saw you in years gone by, when you did not see me. You were formerly
      Member of the Committee of Public Safety, under the Convention."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was."
    </p>
    <p>
      '"You guillotined my father, my brother, my uncle-all my family, nearly,
      and broke my mother's heart. They had done nothing but keep silence. Their
      sentiments were only guessed. Their headless corpses were thrown
      indiscriminately into the ditch of the Mousseaux Cemetery, and destroyed
      with lime."
    </p>
    <p>
      'He nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"You left me without a friend, and here I am now, alone in a foreign
      land."
    </p>
    <p>
      '"I am sorry for you," said be. "Sorry for the consequence, not for the
      intent. What I did was a matter of conscience, and, from a point of view
      indiscernible by you, I did right. I profited not a farthing. But I shall
      not argue this. You have the satisfaction of seeing me here an exile also,
      in poverty, betrayed by comrades, as friendless as yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      '"It is no satisfaction to me, Monsieur."
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Well, things done cannot be altered. Now the question: are you quite
      recovered?"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Not from dislike and dread of you-otherwise, yes."

    <p>
      '"Good morning."

      'They did not meet again till one evening at the theatre (which my
      mother's friend was with great difficulty induced to frequent, to perfect
      herself in English pronunciation, the idea she entertained at that time
      being to become a teacher of English in her own country later on). She
      found him sitting next to her, and it made her pale and restless.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"You are still afraid of me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"I am. O cannot you understand!"
    </p>
    <p>
      'He signified the affirmative.
    </p>

      '"I follow the play with difficulty," he said, presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"So do I-now," said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He regarded her long, and she was conscious of his look; and while she
      kept her eyes on the stage they filled with tears. Still she would not
      move, and the tears ran visibly down her cheek, though the play was a
      merry one, being no other than Mr. Sheridan's comedy of "The Rivals," with
      Mr. S. Kemble as Captain Absolute. He saw her distress, and that her mind
      was elsewhere; and abruptly rising from his seat at candle- snuffing time
      he left the theatre.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Though he lived in the old town, and she in the new, they frequently saw
      each other at a distance. One of these occasions was when she was on the
      north side of the harbour, by the ferry, waiting for the boat to take her
      across. He was standing by Cove Row, on the quay opposite. Instead of
      entering the boat when it arrived she stepped back from the quay; but
      looking to see if he remained she beheld him pointing with his finger to
      the ferry-boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Enter!" he said, in a voice loud enough to reach her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mademoiselle V&mdash;- stood still.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Enter!" he said, and, as she did not move, he repeated the word a third
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      'She had really been going to cross, and now approached and stepped down
      into the boat. Though she did not raise her eyes she knew that he was
      watching her over. At the landing steps she saw from under the brim of her
      hat a hand stretched down. The steps were steep and slippery.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"No, Monsieur," she said. "Unless, indeed, you believe in God, and repent
      of your evil past!"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"I am sorry you were made to suffer. But I only believe in the god called
      Reason, and I do not repent. I was the instrument of a national principle.
      Your friends were not sacrificed for any ends of mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      'She thereupon withheld her hand, and clambered up unassisted. He went on,
      ascending the Look-out Hill, and disappearing over the brow. Her way was
      in the same direction, her errand being to bring home the two young girls
      under her charge, who had gone to the cliff for an airing. When she joined
      them at the top she saw his solitary figure at the further edge, standing
      motionless against the sea. All the while that she remained with her
      pupils he stood without turning, as if looking at the frigates in the
      roadstead, but more probably in meditation, unconscious where he was. In
      leaving the spot one of the children threw away half a sponge-biscuit that
      she had been eating. Passing near it he stooped, picked it up carefully,
      and put it in his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mademoiselle V&mdash;- came homeward, asking herself, "Can he be
      starving?"
    </p>
    <p>
      'From that day he was invisible for so long a time that she thought he had
      gone away altogether. But one evening a note came to her, and she opened
      it trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"I am here ill," it said, "and, as you know, alone. There are one or two
      little things I want done, in case my death should occur,-and I should
      prefer not to ask the people here, if it could be avoided. Have you enough
      of the gift of charity to come and carry out my wishes before it is too
      late?"
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now so it was that, since seeing him possess himself of the broken cake,
      she had insensibly begun to feel something that was more than curiosity,
      though perhaps less than anxiety, about this fellow- countryman of hers;
      and it was not in her nervous and sensitive heart to resist his appeal.
      She found his lodging (to which he had removed from the Old Rooms inn for
      economy) to be a room over a shop, half-way up the steep and narrow street
      of the old town, to which the fashionable visitors seldom penetrated. With
      some misgiving she entered the house, and was admitted to the chamber
      where he lay.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"You are too good, too good," he murmured. And presently, "You need not
      shut the door. You will feel safer, and they will not understand what we
      say."
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Are you in want, Monsieur? Can I give you-"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"No, no. I merely want you to do a trifling thing or two that I have not
      strength enough to do myself. Nobody in the town but you knows who I
      really am-unless you have told?"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"I have not told . . . I thought you might have acted from principle in
      those sad days, even-"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"You are kind to concede that much. However, to the present. I was able
      to destroy my few papers before I became so weak . . . But in the drawer
      there you will find some pieces of linen clothing-only two or three-marked
      with initials that may be recognized. Will you rip them out with a
      penknife?"
    </p>
    <p>
      'She searched as bidden, found the garments, cut out the stitches of the
      lettering, and replaced the linen as before. A promise to post, in the
      event of his death, a letter he put in her hand, completed all that he
      required of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He thanked her. "I think you seem sorry for me," he murmured. "And I am
      surprised. You are sorry?"
    </p>
    <p>
      'She evaded the question. "Do you repent and believe?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"No."
    </p>
    <p>
      'Contrary to her expectations and his own he recovered, though very
      slowly; and her manner grew more distant thenceforward, though his
      influence upon her was deeper than she knew. Weeks passed away, and the
      month of May arrived. One day at this time she met him walking slowly
      along the beach to the northward.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"You know the news?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"You mean of the rupture between France and England again?"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Yes; and the feeling of antagonism is stronger than it was in the last
      war, owing to Bonaparte's high-handed arrest of the innocent English who
      were travelling in our country for pleasure. I feel that the war will be
      long and bitter; and that my wish to live unknown in England will be
      frustrated. See here."
    </p>
    <p>
      'He took from his pocket a piece of the single newspaper which circulated
      in the county in those days, and she read-
    </p>
    <p>
      "The magistrates acting under the Alien Act have been requested to direct
      a very scrutinizing eye to the Academies in our towns and other places, in
      which French tutors are employed, and to all of that nationality who
      profess to be teachers in this country. Many of them are known to be
      inveterate Enemies and Traitors to the nation among whose people they have
      found a livelihood and a home."
    </p>
    <p>
      'He continued: "I have observed since the declaration of war a marked
      difference in the conduct of the rougher class of people here towards me.
      If a great battle were to occur-as it soon will, no doubt-feeling would
      grow to a pitch that would make it impossible for me, a disguised man of
      no known occupation, to stay here. With you, whose duties and antecedents
      are known, it may be less difficult, but still unpleasant. Now I propose
      this. You have probably seen how my deep sympathy with you has quickened
      to a warm feeling; and what I say is, will you agree to give me a title to
      protect you by honouring me with your hand? I am older than you, it is
      true, but as husband and wife we can leave England together, and make the
      whole world our country. Though I would propose Quebec, in Canada, as the
      place which offers the best promise of a home."
    </p>
    <p>
      '"My God! You surprise me!" said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"But you accept my proposal?"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"No, no!"
    </p>

      '"I won't distress you further now."
    </p>

      '"Much thanks . . . I am glad to see you looking better, Monsieur; I mean
      you are looking better."
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Ah, yes. I am improving. I walk in the sun every day."
    </p>
    <p>
      'And almost every day she saw him-sometimes nodding stiffly only,
      sometimes exchanging formal civilities. "You are not gone yet," she said
      on one of these occasions.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"No. At present I don't think of going without you."
    </p>
    <p>
      '"But you find it uncomfortable here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Somewhat. So when will you have pity on me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      'She shook her head and went on her way. Yet she was a little moved. "He
      did it on principle," she would murmur. "He had no animosity towards them,
      and profited nothing!"
    </p>
    <p>
      'She wondered how he lived. It was evident that he could not be so poor as
      she had thought; his pretended poverty might be to escape notice. She
      could not tell, but she knew that she was dangerously interested in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And he still mended, till his thin, pale face became more full and firm.
      As he mended she had to meet that request of his, advanced with even
      stronger insistency.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The arrival of the King and Court for the season as usual brought matters
      to a climax for these two lonely exiles and fellow country- people. The
      King's awkward preference for a part of the coast in such dangerous
      proximity to France made it necessary that a strict military vigilance
      should be exercised to guard the royal residents. Half-a- dozen frigates
      were every night posted in a line across the bay, and two lines of
      sentinels, one at the water's edge and another behind the Esplanade,
      occupied the whole sea-front after eight every night. The watering-place
      was growing an inconvenient residence even for Mademoiselle V&mdash;-
      herself, her friendship for this strange French tutor and writing-master
      who never had any pupils having been observed by many who slightly knew
      her. The General's wife, whose dependent she was, repeatedly warned her
      against the acquaintance; while the Hanoverian and other soldiers of the
      Foreign Legion, who had discovered the nationality of her friend, were
      more aggressive than the English military gallants who made it their
      business to notice her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'In this tense state of affairs her answers became more agitated. "O
      Heaven, how can I marry you!" she would say.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"You will; surely you will!" he answered again. "I don't leave without
      you. And I shall soon be interrogated before the magistrates if I stay
      here; probably imprisoned. You will come?"
    </p>
    <p>
      'She felt her defences breaking down. Contrary to all reason and sense of
      family honour she was, by some abnormal craving, inclining to a tenderness
      for him that was founded on its opposite. Sometimes her warm sentiments
      burnt lower than at others, and then the enormity of her conduct showed
      itself in more staring hues.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Shortly after this he came with a resigned look on his face. "It is as I
      expected," he said. "I have received a hint to go. In good sooth, I am no
      Bonapartist-I am no enemy to England; but the presence of the King made it
      impossible for a foreigner with no visible occupation, and who may be a
      spy, to remain at large in the town. The authorities are civil, but firm.
      They are no more than reasonable. Good. I must go. You must come also."
    </p>
    <p>
      'She did not speak. But she nodded assent, her eyes drooping.
    </p>
    <p>
      'On her way back to the house on the Esplanade she said to herself, "I am
      glad, I am glad! I could not do otherwise. It is rendering good for evil!"
      But she knew how she mocked herself in this, and that the moral principle
      had not operated one jot in her acceptance of him. In truth she had not
      realized till now the full presence of the emotion which had unconsciously
      grown up in her for this lonely and severe man, who, in her tradition, was
      vengeance and irreligion personified. He seemed to absorb her whole
      nature, and, absorbing, to control it.
    </p>
    <p>
      'A day or two before the one fixed for the wedding there chanced to come
      to her a letter from the only acquaintance of her own sex and country she
      possessed in England, one to whom she had sent intelligence of her
      approaching marriage, without mentioning with whom. This friend's
      misfortunes had been somewhat similar to her own, which fact had been one
      cause of their intimacy; her friend's sister, a nun of the Abbey of
      Montmartre, having perished on the scaffold at the hands of the same
      Comite de Salut Public which had numbered Mademoiselle V&mdash;'s
      affianced among its members. The writer had felt her position much again
      of late, since the renewal of the war, she said; and the letter wound up
      with a fresh denunciation of the authors of their mutual bereavement and
      subsequent troubles.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Coming just then, its contents produced upon Mademoiselle V&mdash;- the
      effect of a pail of water upon a somnambulist. What had she been doing in
      betrothing herself to this man! Was she not making herself a parricide
      after the event? At this crisis in her feelings her lover called. He
      beheld her trembling, and, in reply to his question, she told him of her
      scruples with impulsive candour.
    </p>
    <p>
      'She had not intended to do this, but his attitude of tender command
      coerced her into frankness. Thereupon he exhibited an agitation never
      before apparent in him. He said, "But all that is past. You are the symbol
      of Charity, and we are pledged to let bygones be."
    </p>
    <p>
      'His words soothed her for the moment, but she was sadly silent, and he
      went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      'That night she saw (as she firmly believed to the end of her life) a
      divinely sent vision. A procession of her lost relatives-father, brother,
      uncle, cousin-seemed to cross her chamber between her bed and the window,
      and when she endeavoured to trace their features she perceived them to be
      headless, and that she had recognized them by their familiar clothes only.
      In the morning she could not shake off the effects of this appearance on
      her nerves. All that day she saw nothing of her wooer, he being occupied
      in making arrangements for their departure. It grew towards evening-the
      marriage eve; but, in spite of his re-assuring visit, her sense of family
      duty waxed stronger now that she was left alone. Yet, she asked herself,
      how could she, alone and unprotected, go at this eleventh hour and
      reassert to an affianced husband that she could not and would not marry
      him while admitting at the same time that she loved him? The situation
      dismayed her. She had relinquished her post as governess, and was staying
      temporarily in a room near the coach-office, where she expected him to
      call in the morning to carry out the business of their union and
      departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Wisely or foolishly, Mademoiselle V&mdash;- came to a resolution: that
      her only safety lay in flight. His contiguity influenced her too sensibly;
      she could not reason. So packing up her few possessions and placing on the
      table the small sum she owed, she went out privately, secured a last
      available seat in the London coach, and, almost before she had fully
      weighed her action, she was rolling out of the town in the dusk of the
      September evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Having taken this startling step she began to reflect upon her reasons.
      He had been one of that tragic Committee the sound of whose name was a
      horror to the civilized world; yet he had been only one of several
      members, and, it seemed, not the most active. He had marked down names on
      principle, had felt no personal enmity against his victims, and had
      enriched himself not a sou out of the office he had held. Nothing could
      change the past. Meanwhile he loved her, and her heart inclined to as much
      of him as she could detach from that past. Why not, as he had suggested,
      bury memories, and inaugurate a new era by this union? In other words, why
      not indulge her tenderness, since its nullification could do no good.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Thus she held self-communion in her seat in the coach, passing through
      Casterbridge, and Shottsford, and on to the White Hart at Melchester, at
      which place the whole fabric of her recent intentions crumbled down.
      Better be staunch having got so far; let things take their course, and
      marry boldly the man who had so impressed her. How great he was; how small
      was she! And she had presumed to judge him! Abandoning her place in the
      coach with the precipitancy that had characterized her taking it, she
      waited till the vehicle had driven off, something in the departing shapes
      of the outside passengers against the starlit sky giving her a start, as
      she afterwards remembered. Presently the down coach, "The Morning Herald,"
      entered the city, and she hastily obtained a place on the top.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"I'll be firm-I'll be his-if it cost me my immortal soul!" she said. And
      with troubled breathings she journeyed back over the road she had just
      traced.
    </p>
    <p>
      'She reached our royal watering-place by the time the day broke, and her
      first aim was to get back to the hired room in which her last few days had
      been spent. When the landlady appeared at the door in response to
      Mademoiselle V&mdash;'s nervous summons, she explained her sudden
      departure and return as best she could; and no objection being offered to
      her re- engagement of the room for one day longer she ascended to the
      chamber and sat down panting. She was back once more, and her wild
      tergiversations were a secret from him whom alone they concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      'A sealed letter was on the mantelpiece. "Yes, it is directed to you,
      Mademoiselle," said the woman who had followed her. "But we were wondering
      what to do with it. A town messenger brought it after you had gone last
      night."
    </p>
    <p>
      'When the landlady had left, Mademoiselle V&mdash;- opened the letter and
      read-
    </p>
    <p>
      "MY DEAR AND HONOURED FRIEND.-You have been throughout our acquaintance
      absolutely candid concerning your misgivings. But I have been reserved
      concerning mine. That is the difference between us. You probably have not
      guessed that every qualm you have felt on the subject of our marriage has
      been paralleled in my heart to the full. Thus it happened that your
      involuntary outburst of remorse yesterday, though mechanically deprecated
      by me in your presence, was a last item in my own doubts on the wisdom of
      our union, giving them a force that I could no longer withstand. I came
      home; and, on reflection, much as I honour and adore you, I decide to set
      you free.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As one whose life has been devoted, and I may say sacrificed, to the
      cause of Liberty, I cannot allow your judgment (probably a permanent one)
      to be fettered beyond release by a feeling which may be transient only.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It would be no less than excruciating to both that I should announce this
      decision to you by word of mouth. I have therefore taken the less painful
      course of writing. Before you receive this I shall have left the town by
      the evening coach for London, on reaching which city my movements will be
      revealed to none.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Regard me, Mademoiselle, as dead, and accept my renewed assurances of
      respect, remembrance, and affection."
    </p>
    <p>
      'When she had recovered from her shock of surprise and grief, she
      remembered that at the starting of the coach out of Melchester before
      dawn, the shape of a figure among the outside passengers against the
      starlit sky had caused her a momentary start, from its resemblance to that
      of her friend. Knowing nothing of each other's intentions, and screened
      from each other by the darkness, they had left the town by the same
      conveyance. "He, the greater, persevered; I, the smaller, returned!" she
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Recovering from her stupor, Mademoiselle V&mdash;- bethought herself
      again of her employer, Mrs. Newbold, whom recent events had estranged. To
      that lady she went with a full heart, and explained everything. Mrs.
      Newbold kept to herself her opinion of the episode, and reinstalled the
      deserted bride in her old position as governess to the family.
    </p>
    <p>
      'A governess she remained to the end of her days. After the final peace
      with France she became acquainted with my mother, to whom by degrees she
      imparted these experiences of hers. As her hair grew white, and her
      features pinched, Mademoiselle V&mdash;- would wonder what nook of the
      world contained her lover, if he lived, and if by any chance she might see
      him again. But when, some time in the 'twenties, death came to her, at no
      great age, that outline against the stars of the morning remained as the
      last glimpse she ever obtained of her family's foe and her once affianced
      husband.'

      MASTER JOHN HORSELEIGH, KNIGHT
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the earliest and mustiest volume of the Havenpool marriage registers
      (said the thin-faced gentleman) this entry may still be read by any one
      curious enough to decipher the crabbed handwriting of the date. I took a
      copy of it when I was last there; and it runs thus (he had opened his
      pocket-book, and now read aloud the extract; afterwards handing round the
      book to us, wherein we saw transcribed the following)-
    </p>
    <p>
      Mastr John Horseleigh, Knyght, of the p'ysshe of Clyffton was maryd to
      Edith the wyffe late off John Stocker, m'chawnte of Havenpool the xiiij
      daje of December be p'vylegge gevyn by our sup'me hedd of the chyrche of
      Ingelonde Kynge Henry the viii th 1539.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, if you turn to the long and elaborate pedigree of the ancient family
      of the Horseleighs of Clyfton Horseleigh, you will find no mention
      whatever of this alliance, notwithstanding the privilege given by the
      Sovereign and head of the Church; the said Sir John being therein
      chronicled as marrying, at a date apparently earlier than the above, the
      daughter and heiress of Richard Phelipson, of Montislope, in Nether
      Wessex, a lady who outlived him, of which marriage there were issue two
      daughters and a son, who succeeded him in his estates. How are we to
      account for these, as it would seem, contemporaneous wives? A strange
      local tradition only can help us, and this can be briefly told.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening in the autumn of the year 1540 or 1541, a young sailor, whose
      Christian name was Roger, but whose surname is not known, landed at his
      native place of Havenpool, on the South Wessex coast, after a voyage in
      the Newfoundland trade, then newly sprung into existence. He returned in
      the ship Primrose with a cargo of 'trayne oyle brought home from the New
      Founde Lande,' to quote from the town records of the date. During his
      absence of two summers and a winter, which made up the term of a
      Newfoundland 'spell,' many unlooked-for changes had occurred within the
      quiet little seaport, some of which closely affected Roger the sailor. At
      the time of his departure his only sister Edith had become the bride of
      one Stocker, a respectable townsman, and part owner of the brig in which
      Roger had sailed; and it was to the house of this couple, his only
      relatives, that the young man directed his steps. On trying the door in
      Quay Street he found it locked, and then observed that the windows were
      boarded up. Inquiring of a bystander, he learnt for the first time of the
      death of his brother-in-law, though that event had taken place nearly
      eighteen months before.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And my sister Edith?' asked Roger.
    </p>
    <p>
      'She's married again-as they do say, and hath been so these twelve months.
      I don't vouch for the truth o't, though if she isn't she ought to be.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Roger's face grew dark. He was a man with a considerable reserve of strong
      passion, and he asked his informant what he meant by speaking thus.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man explained that shortly after the young woman's bereavement a
      stranger had come to the port. He had seen her moping on the quay, had
      been attracted by her youth and loneliness, and in an extraordinarily
      brief wooing had completely fascinated her-had carried her off, and, as
      was reported, had married her. Though he had come by water, he was
      supposed to live no very great distance off by land. They were last heard
      of at Oozewood, in Upper Wessex, at the house of one Wall, a
      timber-merchant, where, he believed, she still had a lodging, though her
      husband, if he were lawfully that much, was but an occasional visitor to
      the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The stranger?' asked Roger. 'Did you see him? What manner of man was he?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I liked him not,' said the other. 'He seemed of that kind that hath
      something to conceal, and as he walked with her he ever and anon turned
      his head and gazed behind him, as if he much feared an unwelcome pursuer.
      But, faith,' continued he, 'it may have been the man's anxiety only. Yet
      did I not like him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Was he older than my sister?' Roger asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ay-much older; from a dozen to a score of years older. A man of some
      position, maybe, playing an amorous game for the pleasure of the hour. Who
      knoweth but that he have a wife already? Many have done the thing
      hereabouts of late.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Having paid a visit to the graves of his relatives, the sailor next day
      went along the straight road which, then a lane, now a highway, conducted
      to the curious little inland town named by the Havenpool man. It is
      unnecessary to describe Oozewood on the South-Avon. It has a railway at
      the present day; but thirty years of steam traffic past its precincts have
      hardly modified its original features. Surrounded by a sort of fresh-water
      lagoon, dividing it from meadows and coppice, its ancient thatch and
      timber houses have barely made way even in the front street for the
      ubiquitous modern brick and slate. It neither increases nor diminishes in
      size; it is difficult to say what the inhabitants find to do, for, though
      trades in woodware are still carried on, there cannot be enough of this
      class of work nowadays to maintain all the householders, the forests
      around having been so greatly thinned and curtailed. At the time of this
      tradition the forests were dense, artificers in wood abounded, and the
      timber trade was brisk. Every house in the town, without exception, was of
      oak framework, filled in with plaster, and covered with thatch, the
      chimney being the only brick portion of the structure. Inquiry soon
      brought Roger the sailor to the door of Wall, the timber-dealer referred
      to, but it was some time before he was able to gain admission to the
      lodging of his sister, the people having plainly received directions not
      to welcome strangers.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was sitting in an upper room on one of the lath-backed, willow-
      bottomed 'shepherd's' chairs, made on the spot then as to this day, and as
      they were probably made there in the days of the Heptarchy. In her lap was
      an infant, which she had been suckling, though now it had fallen asleep;
      so had the young mother herself for a few minutes, under the drowsing
      effects of solitude. Hearing footsteps on the stairs, she awoke, started
      up with a glad cry, and ran to the door, opening which she met her brother
      on the threshold.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, this is merry; I didn't expect 'ee!' she said. 'Ah, Roger-I thought it
      was John.' Her tones fell to disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sailor kissed her, looked at her sternly for a few moments, and
      pointing to the infant, said, 'You mean the father of this?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, my husband,' said Edith.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I hope so,' he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, Roger, I'm married-of a truth am I!' she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Shame upon 'ee, if true! If not true, worse. Master Stocker was an honest
      man, and ye should have respected his memory longer. Where is thy
      husband?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He comes often. I thought it was he now. Our marriage has to be kept
      secret for a while-it was done privily for certain reasons; but we was
      married at church like honest folk-afore God we were, Roger, six months
      after poor Stocker's death.'
    </p>
    <p>
      ''Twas too soon,' said Roger.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I was living in a house alone; I had nowhere to go to. You were far over
      sea in the New Found Land, and John took me and brought me here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How often doth he come?' says Roger again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Once or twice weekly,' says she.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I wish th' 'dst waited till I returned, dear Edy,' he said. 'It mid be
      you are a wife-I hope so. But, if so, why this mystery? Why this mean and
      cramped lodging in this lonely copse-circled town? Of what standing is
      your husband, and of where?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He is of gentle breeding-his name is John. I am not free to tell his
      family-name. He is said to be of London, for safety' sake; but he really
      lives in the county next adjoining this.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Where in the next county?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I do not know. He has preferred not to tell me, that I may not have the
      secret forced from me, to his and my hurt, by bringing the marriage to the
      ears of his kinsfolk and friends.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Her brother's face flushed. 'Our people have been honest townsmen,
      well-reputed for long; why should you readily take such humbling from a
      sojourner of whom th' 'st know nothing?'
    </p>
    <p>
      They remained in constrained converse till her quick ear caught a sound,
      for which she might have been waiting-a horse's footfall. 'It is John!'
      said she. 'This is his night-Saturday.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't be frightened lest he should find me here!' said Roger. 'I am on
      the point of leaving. I wish not to be a third party. Say nothing at all
      about my visit, if it will incommode you so to do. I will see thee before
      I go afloat again.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Speaking thus he left the room, and descending the staircase let himself
      out by the front door, thinking he might obtain a glimpse of the
      approaching horseman. But that traveller had in the meantime gone
      stealthily round to the back of the homestead, and peering along the
      pinion-end of the house Roger discerned him unbridling and haltering his
      horse with his own hands in the shed there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roger retired to the neighbouring inn called the Black Lamb, and
      meditated. This mysterious method of approach determined him, after all,
      not to leave the place till he had ascertained more definite facts of his
      sister's position-whether she were the deluded victim of the stranger or
      the wife she obviously believed herself to be. Having eaten some supper,
      he left the inn, it being now about eleven o'clock. He first looked into
      the shed, and, finding the horse still standing there, waited irresolutely
      near the door of his sister's lodging. Half an hour elapsed, and, while
      thinking he would climb into a loft hard by for a night's rest, there
      seemed to be a movement within the shutters of the sitting-room that his
      sister occupied. Roger hid himself behind a faggot-stack near the back
      door, rightly divining that his sister's visitor would emerge by the way
      he had entered. The door opened, and the candle she held in her hand
      lighted for a moment the stranger's form, showing it to be that of a tall
      and handsome personage, about forty years of age, and apparently of a
      superior position in life. Edith was assisting him to cloak himself, which
      being done he took leave of her with a kiss and left the house. From the
      door she watched him bridle and saddle his horse, and having mounted and
      waved an adieu to her as she stood candle in hand, he turned out of the
      yard and rode away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The horse which bore him was, or seemed to be, a little lame, and Roger
      fancied from this that the rider's journey was not likely to be a long
      one. Being light of foot he followed apace, having no great difficulty on
      such a still night in keeping within earshot some few miles, the horseman
      pausing more than once. In this pursuit Roger discovered the rider to
      choose bridle-tracks and open commons in preference to any high road. The
      distance soon began to prove a more trying one than he had bargained for;
      and when out of breath and in some despair of being able to ascertain the
      man's identity, he perceived an ass standing in the starlight under a
      hayrick, from which the animal was helping itself to periodic mouthfuls.
    </p>
    <p>
      The story goes that Roger caught the ass, mounted, and again resumed the
      trail of the unconscious horseman, which feat may have been possible to a
      nautical young fellow, though one can hardly understand how a sailor would
      ride such an animal without bridle or saddle, and strange to his hands,
      unless the creature were extraordinarily docile. This question, however,
      is immaterial. Suffice it to say that at dawn the following morning Roger
      beheld his sister's lover or husband entering the gates of a large and
      well-timbered park on the south-western verge of the White Hart Forest (as
      it was then called), now known to everybody as the Vale of Blackmoor.
      Thereupon the sailor discarded his steed, and finding for himself an
      obscurer entrance to the same park a little further on, he crossed the
      grass to reconnoitre.
    </p>
    <p>
      He presently perceived amid the trees before him a mansion which, new to
      himself, was one of the best known in the county at that time. Of this
      fine manorial residence hardly a trace now remains; but a manuscript dated
      some years later than the events we are regarding describes it in terms
      from which the imagination may construct a singularly clear and vivid
      picture. This record presents it as consisting of 'a faire yellow
      freestone building, partly two and partly three storeys; a faire halle and
      parlour, both waynscotted; a faire dyning roome and withdrawing roome, and
      many good lodgings; a kitchen adjoyninge backwarde to one end of the
      dwelling-house, with a faire passage from it into the halle, parlour, and
      dyninge roome, and sellars adjoyninge.
    </p>
    <p>
      'In the front of the house a square greene court, and a curious gatehouse
      with lodgings in it, standing with the front of the house to the south; in
      a large outer court three stables, a coach-house, a large barne, and a
      stable for oxen and kyne, and all houses necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Without the gatehouse, paled in, a large square greene, in which standeth
      a faire chappell; of the south-east side of the greene court, towards the
      river, a large garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of the south-west side of the greene court is a large bowling greene,
      with fower mounted walks about it, all walled about with a batteled wall,
      and sett with all sorts of fruit; and out of it into the feildes there are
      large walks under many tall elmes orderly planted.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Then follows a description of the orchards and gardens; the servants'
      offices, brewhouse, bakehouse, dairy, pigeon-houses, and corn-mill; the
      river and its abundance of fish; the warren, the coppices, the walks;
      ending thus-
    </p>
    <p>
      'And all the country north of the house, open champaign, sandy feildes,
      very dry and pleasant for all kindes of recreation, huntinge, and
      hawkinge, and profitble for tillage . . . The house hath a large prospect
      east, south, and west, over a very large and pleasant vale . . . is seated
      from the good markett towns of Sherton Abbas three miles, and Ivel a mile,
      that plentifully yield all manner of provision; and within twelve miles of
      the south sea.'
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on the grass before this seductive and picturesque structure that
      the sailor stood at gaze under the elms in the dim dawn of Sunday morning,
      and saw to his surprise his sister's lover and horse vanish within the
      court of the building.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perplexed and weary, Roger slowly retreated, more than ever convinced that
      something was wrong in his sister's position. He crossed the bowling green
      to the avenue of elms, and, bent on further research, was about to climb
      into one of these, when, looking below, he saw a heap of hay apparently
      for horses or deer. Into this he crept, and, having eaten a crust of bread
      which he had hastily thrust into his pocket at the inn, he curled up and
      fell asleep, the hay forming a comfortable bed, and quite covering him
      over.
    </p>
    <p>
      He slept soundly and long, and was awakened by the sound of a bell. On
      peering from the hay he found the time had advanced to full day; the sun
      was shining brightly. The bell was that of the 'faire chappell' on the
      green outside the gatehouse, and it was calling to matins. Presently the
      priest crossed the green to a little side-door in the chancel, and then
      from the gateway of the mansion emerged the household, the tall man whom
      Roger had seen with his sister on the previous night, on his arm being a
      portly dame, and, running beside the pair, two little girls and a boy.
      These all entered the chapel, and the bell having ceased and the environs
      become clear, the sailor crept out from his hiding.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sauntered towards the chapel, the opening words of the service being
      audible within. While standing by the porch he saw a belated servitor
      approaching from the kitchen-court to attend the service also. Roger
      carelessly accosted him, and asked, as an idle wanderer, the name of the
      family he had just seen cross over from the mansion.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Od zounds! if ye modden be a stranger here in very truth, goodman. That
      wer Sir John and his dame, and his children Elizabeth, Mary, and John.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I be from foreign parts. Sir John what d'ye call'n?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Master John Horseleigh, Knight, who had a'most as much lond by
      inheritance of his mother as 'a had by his father, and likewise some by
      his wife. Why, bain't his arms dree goolden horses' heads, and idden his
      lady the daughter of Master Richard Phelipson, of Montislope, in Nether
      Wessex, known to us all?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It mid be so, and yet it mid not. However, th' 'lt miss thy prayers for
      such an honest knight's welfare, and I have to traipse seaward many
      miles.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He went onward, and as he walked continued saying to himself, 'Now to that
      poor wronged fool Edy. The fond thing! I thought it; 'twas too quick-she
      was ever amorous. What's to become of her! God wot! How be I going to face
      her with the news, and how be I to hold it from her? To bring this
      disgrace on my father's honoured name, a double-tongued knave!' He turned
      and shook his fist at the chapel and all in it, and resumed his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps it was owing to the perplexity of his mind that, instead of
      returning by the direct road towards his sister's obscure lodging in the
      next county, he followed the highway to Casterbridge, some fifteen miles
      off, where he remained drinking hard all that afternoon and evening, and
      where he lay that and two or three succeeding nights, wandering thence
      along the Anglebury road to some village that way, and lying the Friday
      night after at his native place of Havenpool. The sight of the familiar
      objects there seems to have stirred him anew to action, and the next
      morning he was observed pursuing the way to Oozewood that he had followed
      on the Saturday previous, reckoning, no doubt, that Saturday night would,
      as before, be a time for finding Sir John with his sister again.
    </p>
    <p>
      He delayed to reach the place till just before sunset. His sister was
      walking in the meadows at the foot of the garden, with a nursemaid who
      carried the baby, and she looked up pensively when he approached. Anxiety
      as to her position had already told upon her once rosy cheeks and lucid
      eyes. But concern for herself and child was displaced for the moment by
      her regard of Roger's worn and haggard face.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why-you are sick, Roger-you are tired! Where have you been these many
      days? Why not keep me company a bit-my husband is much away? And we have
      hardly spoke at all of dear father and of your voyage to the New Land. Why
      did you go away so suddenly? There is a spare chamber at my lodging.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Come indoors,' he said. 'We'll talk now-talk a good deal. As for him
      [nodding to the child], better heave him into the river; better for him
      and you!'
    </p>
    <p>
      She forced a laugh, as if she tried to see a good joke in the remark, and
      they went silently indoors.
    </p>
    <p>
      'A miserable hole!' said Roger, looking round the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nay, but 'tis very pretty!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not after what I've seen. Did he marry 'ee at church in orderly fashion?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He did sure-at our church at Havenpool.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But in a privy way?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ay-because of his friends-it was at night-time.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ede, ye fond one-for all that he's not thy husband! Th' 'rt not his wife;
      and the child is a bastard. He hath a wife and children of his own rank,
      and bearing his name; and that's Sir John Horseleigh, of Clyfton
      Horseleigh, and not plain Jack, as you think him, and your lawful husband.
      The sacrament of marriage is no safeguard nowadays. The King's new-made
      headship of the Church hath led men to practise these tricks lightly.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She had turned white. 'That's not true, Roger!' she said. 'You are in
      liquor, my brother, and you know not what you say! Your seafaring years
      have taught 'ee bad things!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Edith-I've seen them; wife and family-all. How canst-'
    </p>
    <p>
      They were sitting in the gathered darkness, and at that moment steps were
      heard without. 'Go out this way,' she said. 'It is my husband. He must not
      see thee in this mood. Get away till to-morrow, Roger, as you care for
      me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She pushed her brother through a door leading to the back stairs, and
      almost as soon as it was closed her visitor entered. Roger, however, did
      not retreat down the stairs; he stood and looked through the bobbin- hole.
      If the visitor turned out to be Sir John, he had determined to confront
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the knight. She had struck a light on his entry, and he kissed the
      child, and took Edith tenderly by the shoulders, looking into her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Something's gone awry wi' my dear!' he said. 'What is it? What's the
      matter?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, Jack!' she cried. 'I have heard such a fearsome rumour-what doth it
      mean? He who told me is my best friend. He must be deceived! But who
      deceived him, and why? Jack, I was just told that you had a wife living
      when you married me, and have her still!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A wife?-H'm.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, and children. Say no, say no!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'By God! I have no lawful wife but you; and as for children, many or few,
      they are all bastards, save this one alone!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And that you be Sir John Horseleigh of Clyfton?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I mid be. I have never said so to 'ee.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But Sir John is known to have a lady, and issue of her!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The knight looked down. 'How did thy mind get filled with such as this?'
      he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      'One of my kindred came.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A traitor! Why should he mar our life? Ah! you said you had a brother at
      sea-where is he now?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Here!' came from close behind him. And flinging open the door, Roger
      faced the intruder. 'Liar!' he said, 'to call thyself her husband!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir John fired up, and made a rush at the sailor, who seized him by the
      collar, and in the wrestle they both fell, Roger under. But in a few
      seconds he contrived to extricate his right arm, and drawing from his belt
      a knife which he wore attached to a cord round his neck he opened it with
      his teeth, and struck it into the breast of Sir John stretched above him.
      Edith had during these moments run into the next room to place the child
      in safety, and when she came back the knight was relaxing his hold on
      Roger's throat. He rolled over upon his back and groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only witness of the scene save the three concerned was the nursemaid,
      who had brought in the child on its father's arrival. She stated
      afterwards that nobody suspected Sir John had received his death wound;
      yet it was so, though he did not die for a long while, meaning thereby an
      hour or two; that Mistress Edith continually endeavoured to staunch the
      blood, calling her brother Roger a wretch, and ordering him to get himself
      gone; on which order he acted, after a gloomy pause, by opening the
      window, and letting himself down by the sill to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was then that Sir John, in difficult accents, made his dying
      declaration to the nurse and Edith, and, later, the apothecary; which was
      to this purport, that the Dame Horseleigh who passed as his wife at
      Clyfton, and who had borne him three children, was in truth and deed,
      though unconsciously, the wife of another man. Sir John had married her
      several years before, in the face of the whole county, as the widow of one
      Decimus Strong, who had disappeared shortly after her union with him,
      having adventured to the North to join the revolt of the Nobles, and on
      that revolt being quelled retreated across the sea. Two years ago, having
      discovered this man to be still living in France, and not wishing to
      disturb the mind and happiness of her who believed herself his wife, yet
      wishing for legitimate issue, Sir John had informed the King of the facts,
      who had encouraged him to wed honestly, though secretly, the young
      merchant's widow at Havenpool; she being, therefore, his lawful wife, and
      she only. That to avoid all scandal and hubbub he had purposed to let
      things remain as they were till fair opportunity should arise of making
      the true case known with least pain to all parties concerned, but that,
      having been thus suspected and attacked by his own brother-in-law, his
      zest for such schemes and for all things had died out in him, and he only
      wished to commend his soul to God.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night, while the owls were hooting from the forest that encircled the
      sleeping townlet, and the South-Avon was gurgling through the wooden piles
      of the bridge, Sir John died there in the arms of his wife. She concealed
      nothing of the cause of her husband's death save the subject of the
      quarrel, which she felt it would be premature to announce just then, and
      until proof of her status should be forthcoming. But before a month had
      passed, it happened, to her inexpressible sorrow, that the child of this
      clandestine union fell sick and died. From that hour all interest in the
      name and fame of the Horseleighs forsook the younger of the twain who
      called themselves wives of Sir John, and, being careless about her own
      fame, she took no steps to assert her claims, her legal position having,
      indeed, grown hateful to her in her horror at the tragedy. And Sir William
      Byrt, the curate who had married her to her husband, being an old man and
      feeble, was not disinclined to leave the embers unstirred of such a fiery
      matter as this, and to assist her in letting established things stand.
      Therefore, Edith retired with the nurse, her only companion and friend, to
      her native town, where she lived in absolute obscurity till her death in
      middle age. Her brother was never seen again in England.
    </p>
    <p>
      A strangely corroborative sequel to the story remains to be told. Shortly
      after the death of Sir John Horseleigh, a soldier of fortune returned from
      the Continent, called on Dame Horseleigh the fictitious, living in widowed
      state at Clyfton Horseleigh, and, after a singularly brief courtship,
      married her. The tradition at Havenpool and elsewhere has ever been that
      this man was already her husband, Decimus Strong, who remarried her for
      appearance' sake only.
    </p>
    <p>
      The illegitimate son of this lady by Sir John succeeded to the estates and
      honours, and his son after him, there being nobody on the alert to
      investigate their pretensions. Little difference would it have made to the
      present generation, however, had there been such a one, for the family in
      all its branches, lawful and unlawful, has been extinct these many score
      years, the last representative but one being killed at the siege of
      Sherton Castle, while attacking in the service of the Parliament, and the
      other being outlawed later in the same century for a debt of ten pounds,
      and dying in the county jail. The mansion house and its appurtenances
      were, as I have previously stated, destroyed, excepting one small wing,
      which now forms part of a farmhouse, and is visible as you pass along the
      railway from Casterbridge to Ivel. The outline of the old bowling-green is
      also distinctly to be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, then, is the reason why the only lawful marriage of Sir John, as
      recorded in the obscure register at Havenpool, does not appear in the
      pedigree of the house of Horseleigh.

    <h2>
      THE DUKE'S REAPPEARANCE-A FAMILY TRADITION
    </h2>
    <p>
      According to the kinsman who told me the story, Christopher Swetman's
      house, on the outskirts of King's-Hintock village, was in those days
      larger and better kept than when, many years later, it was sold to the
      lord of the manor adjoining; after having been in the Swetman family, as
      one may say, since the Conquest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some people would have it to be that the thing happened at the house
      opposite, belonging to one Childs, with whose family the Swetmans
      afterwards intermarried. But that it was at the original homestead of the
      Swetmans can be shown in various ways; chiefly by the unbroken traditions
      of the family, and indirectly by the evidence of the walls themselves,
      which are the only ones thereabout with windows mullioned in the
      Elizabethan manner, and plainly of a date anterior to the event; while
      those of the other house might well have been erected fifty or eighty
      years later, and probably were; since the choice of Swetman's house by the
      fugitive was doubtless dictated by no other circumstance than its then
      suitable loneliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a cloudy July morning just before dawn, the hour of two having been
      struck by Swetman's one-handed clock on the stairs, that is still
      preserved in the family. Christopher heard the strokes from his chamber,
      immediately at the top of the staircase, and overlooking the front of the
      house. He did not wonder that he was sleepless. The rumours and
      excitements which had latterly stirred the neighbourhood, to the effect
      that the rightful King of England had landed from Holland, at a port only
      eighteen miles to the south-west of Swetman's house, were enough to make
      wakeful and anxious even a contented yeoman like him. Some of the
      villagers, intoxicated by the news, had thrown down their scythes, and
      rushed to the ranks of the invader. Christopher Swetman had weighed both
      sides of the question, and had remained at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now as he lay thinking of these and other things he fancied that he could
      hear the footfall of a man on the road leading up to his house-a byway,
      which led scarce anywhere else; and therefore a tread was at any time more
      apt to startle the inmates of the homestead than if it had stood in a
      thoroughfare. The footfall came opposite the gate, and stopped there. One
      minute, two minutes passed, and the pedestrian did not proceed.
      Christopher Swetman got out of bed, and opened the casement. 'Hoi! who's
      there?' cries he.
    </p>
    <p>
      'A friend,' came from the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And what mid ye want at this time o' night?' says Swetman.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Shelter. I've lost my way.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What's thy name?'
    </p>
    <p>
      There came no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Be ye one of King Monmouth's men?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He that asks no questions will hear no lies from me. I am a stranger; and
      I am spent, and hungered. Can you let me lie with you to-night?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Swetman was generous to people in trouble, and his house was roomy. 'Wait
      a bit,' he said, 'and I'll come down and have a look at thee, anyhow.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He struck a light, put on his clothes, and descended, taking his horn-
      lantern from a nail in the passage, and lighting it before opening the
      door. The rays fell on the form of a tall, dark man in cavalry
      accoutrements and wearing a sword. He was pale with fatigue and covered
      with mud, though the weather was dry.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Prithee take no heed of my appearance,' said the stranger. 'But let me
      in.'
    </p>
    <p>
      That his visitor was in sore distress admitted of no doubt, and the
      yeoman's natural humanity assisted the other's sad importunity and gentle
      voice. Swetman took him in, not without a suspicion that this man
      represented in some way Monmouth's cause, to which he was not unfriendly
      in his secret heart. At his earnest request the new-comer was given a suit
      of the yeoman's old clothes in exchange for his own, which, with his
      sword, were hidden in a closet in Swetman's chamber; food was then put
      before him and a lodging provided for him in a room at the back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here he slept till quite late in the morning, which was Sunday, the sixth
      of July, and when he came down in the garments that he had borrowed he met
      the household with a melancholy smile. Besides Swetman himself, there were
      only his two daughters, Grace and Leonard (the latter was, oddly enough, a
      woman's name here), and both had been enjoined to secrecy. They asked no
      questions and received no information; though the stranger regarded their
      fair countenances with an interest almost too deep. Having partaken of
      their usual breakfast of ham and cider he professed weariness and retired
      to the chamber whence he had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a couple of hours or thereabout he came down again, the two young women
      having now gone off to morning service. Seeing Christopher bustling about
      the house without assistance, he asked if he could do anything to aid his
      host.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he seemed anxious to hide all differences and appear as one of
      themselves, Swetman set him to get vegetables from the garden and fetch
      water from Buttock's Spring in the dip near the house (though the spring
      was not called by that name till years after, by the way).
    </p>
    <p>
      'And what can I do next?' says the stranger when these services had been
      performed.
    </p>
    <p>
      His meekness and docility struck Christopher much, and won upon him.
      'Since you be minded to,' says the latter, 'you can take down the dishes
      and spread the table for dinner. Take a pewter plate for thyself, but the
      trenchers will do for we.'
    </p>
    <p>
      But the other would not, and took a trencher likewise, in doing which he
      spoke of the two girls and remarked how comely they were.
    </p>
    <p>
      This quietude was put an end to by a stir out of doors, which was
      sufficient to draw Swetman's attention to it, and he went out. Farm hands
      who had gone off and joined the Duke on his arrival had begun to come in
      with news that a midnight battle had been fought on the moors to the
      north, the Duke's men, who had attacked, being entirely worsted; the Duke
      himself, with one or two lords and other friends, had fled, no one knew
      whither.
    </p>
    <p>
      'There has been a battle,' says Swetman, on coming indoors after these
      tidings, and looking earnestly at the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      'May the victory be to the rightful in the end, whatever the issue now,'
      says the other, with a sorrowful sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dost really know nothing about it?' said Christopher. 'I could have sworn
      you was one from that very battle!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I was here before three o' the clock this morning; and these men have
      only arrived now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'True,' said the yeoman. 'But still, I think-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do not press your question,' the stranger urged. 'I am in a strait, and
      can refuse a helper nothing; such inquiry is, therefore, unfair.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'True again,' said Swetman, and held his tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      The daughters of the house returned from church, where the service had
      been hurried by reason of the excitement. To their father's questioning if
      they had spoken of him who sojourned there they replied that they had said
      never a word; which, indeed, was true, as events proved.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bade them serve the dinner; and, as the visitor had withdrawn since the
      news of the battle, prepared to take a platter to him upstairs. But he
      preferred to come down and dine with the family.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the afternoon more fugitives passed through the village, but
      Christopher Swetman, his visitor, and his family kept indoors. In the
      evening, however, Swetman came out from his gate, and, harkening in
      silence to these tidings and more, wondered what might be in store for him
      for his last night's work.
    </p>
    <p>
      He returned homeward by a path across the mead that skirted his own
      orchard. Passing here, he heard the voice of his daughter Leonard
      expostulating inside the hedge, her words being: 'Don't ye, sir; don't! I
      prithee let me go!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, sweetheart?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Because I've a-promised another!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Peeping through, as he could not help doing, he saw the girl struggling in
      the arms of the stranger, who was attempting to kiss her; but finding her
      resistance to be genuine, and her distress unfeigned, he reluctantly let
      her go.
    </p>
    <p>
      Swetman's face grew dark, for his girls were more to him than himself. He
      hastened on, meditating moodily all the way. He entered the gate, and made
      straight for the orchard. When he reached it his daughter had disappeared,
      but the stranger was still standing there.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sir!' said the yeoman, his anger having in no wise abated, 'I've seen
      what has happened! I have taken 'ee into my house, at some jeopardy to
      myself; and, whoever you be, the least I expected of 'ee was to treat the
      maidens with a seemly respect. You have not done it, and I no longer trust
      you. I am the more watchful over them in that they are motherless; and I
      must ask 'ee to go after dark this night!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger seemed dazed at discovering what his impulse had brought down
      upon his head, and his pale face grew paler. He did not reply for a time.
      When he did speak his soft voice was thick with feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sir,' says he, 'I own that I am in the wrong, if you take the matter
      gravely. We do not what we would but what we must. Though I have not
      injured your daughter as a woman, I have been treacherous to her as a
      hostess and friend in need. I'll go, as you say; I can do no less. I shall
      doubtless find a refuge elsewhere.'
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked towards the house in silence, where Swetman insisted that his
      guest should have supper before departing. By the time this was eaten it
      was dusk and the stranger announced that he was ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went upstairs to where the garments and sword lay hidden, till the
      departing one said that on further thought he would ask another favour:
      that he should be allowed to retain the clothes he wore, and that his host
      would keep the others and the sword till he, the speaker, should come or
      send for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      'As you will,' said Swetman. 'The gain is on my side; for those clouts
      were but kept to dress a scarecrow next fall.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'They suit my case,' said the stranger sadly. 'However much they may
      misfit me, they do not misfit my sorry fortune now!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nay, then,' said Christopher relenting, 'I was too hasty. Sh'lt bide!'
    </p>
    <p>
      But the other would not, saying that it was better that things should take
      their course. Notwithstanding that Swetman importuned him, he only added,
      'If I never come again, do with my belongings as you list. In the pocket
      you will find a gold snuff-box, and in the snuff-box fifty gold pieces.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But keep 'em for thy use, man!' said the yeoman.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No,' says the parting guest; 'they are foreign pieces and would harm me
      if I were taken. Do as I bid thee. Put away these things again and take
      especial charge of the sword. It belonged to my father's father and I
      value it much. But something more common becomes me now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Saying which, he took, as he went downstairs, one of the ash sticks used
      by Swetman himself for walking with. The yeoman lighted him out to the
      garden hatch, where he disappeared through Clammers Gate by the road that
      crosses King's-Hintock Park to Evershead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher returned to the upstairs chamber, and sat down on his bed
      reflecting. Then he examined the things left behind, and surely enough in
      one of the pockets the gold snuff-box was revealed, containing the fifty
      gold pieces as stated by the fugitive. The yeoman next looked at the sword
      which its owner had stated to have belonged to his grandfather. It was
      two-edged, so that he almost feared to handle it. On the blade was
      inscribed the words 'ANDREA FERARA,' and among the many fine chasings were
      a rose and crown, the plume of the Prince of Wales, and two portraits;
      portraits of a man and a woman, the man's having the face of the first
      King Charles, and the woman's, apparently, that of his Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Swetman, much awed and surprised, returned the articles to the closet, and
      went downstairs pondering. Of his surmise he said nothing to his
      daughters, merely declaring to them that the gentleman was gone; and never
      revealing that he had been an eye-witness of the unpleasant scene in the
      orchard that was the immediate cause of the departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing occurred in Hintock during the week that followed, beyond the
      fitful arrival of more decided tidings concerning the utter defeat of the
      Duke's army and his own disappearance at an early stage of the battle.
      Then it was told that Monmouth was taken, not in his own clothes but in
      the disguise of a countryman. He had been sent to London, and was confined
      in the Tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      The possibility that his guest had been no other than the Duke made
      Swetman unspeakably sorry now; his heart smote him at the thought that,
      acting so harshly for such a small breach of good faith, he might have
      been the means of forwarding the unhappy fugitive's capture. On the girls
      coming up to him he said, 'Get away with ye, wenches: I fear you have been
      the ruin of an unfortunate man!'
    </p>
    <p>
      On the Tuesday night following, when the yeoman was sleeping as usual in
      his chamber, he was, he said, conscious of the entry of some one. Opening
      his eyes, he beheld by the light of the moon, which shone upon the front
      of his house, the figure of a man who seemed to be the stranger moving
      from the door towards the closet. He was dressed somewhat differently now,
      but the face was quite that of his late guest in its tragical pensiveness,
      as was also the tallness of his figure. He neared the closet; and, feeling
      his visitor to be within his rights, Christopher refrained from stirring.
      The personage turned his large haggard eyes upon the bed where Swetman
      lay, and then withdrew from their hiding the articles that belonged to
      him, again giving a hard gaze at Christopher as he went noiselessly out of
      the chamber with his properties on his arm. His retreat down the stairs
      was just audible, and also his departure by the side door, through which
      entrance or exit was easy to those who knew the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing further happened, and towards morning Swetman slept. To avoid all
      risk he said not a word to the girls of the visit of the night, and
      certainly not to any one outside the house; for it was dangerous at that
      time to avow anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the killed in opposing the recent rising had been a younger brother
      of the lord of the manor, who lived at King's-Hintock Court hard by.
      Seeing the latter ride past in mourning clothes next day, Swetman ventured
      to condole with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He'd no business there!' answered the other. His words and manner showed
      the bitterness that was mingled with his regret. 'But say no more of him.
      You know what has happened since, I suppose?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I know that they say Monmouth is taken, Sir Thomas, but I can't think it
      true,' answered Swetman.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O zounds! 'tis true enough,' cried the knight, 'and that's not all. The
      Duke was executed on Tower Hill two days ago.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'D'ye say it verily?' says Swetman.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And a very hard death he had, worse luck for 'n,' said Sir Thomas. 'Well,
      'tis over for him and over for my brother. But not for the rest. There'll
      be searchings and siftings down here anon; and happy is the man who has
      had nothing to do with this matter!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Swetman had hardly heard the latter words, so much was he confounded
      by the strangeness of the tidings that the Duke had come to his death on
      the previous Tuesday. For it had been only the night before this present
      day of Friday that he had seen his former guest, whom he had ceased to
      doubt could be other than the Duke, come into his chamber and fetch away
      his accoutrements as he had promised.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It couldn't have been a vision,' said Christopher to himself when the
      knight had ridden on. 'But I'll go straight and see if the things be in
      the closet still; and thus I shall surely learn if 'twere a vision or no.'
    </p>
    <p>
      To the closet he went, which he had not looked into since the stranger's
      departure. And searching behind the articles placed to conceal the things
      hidden, he found that, as he had never doubted, they were gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the rumour spread abroad in the West that the man beheaded in the
      Tower was not indeed the Duke, but one of his officers taken after the
      battle, and that the Duke had been assisted to escape out of the country,
      Swetman found in it an explanation of what so deeply mystified him. That
      his visitor might have been a friend of the Duke's, whom the Duke had
      asked to fetch the things in a last request, Swetman would never admit.
      His belief in the rumour that Monmouth lived, like that of thousands of
      others, continued to the end of his days.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Such, briefly, concluded my kinsman, is the tradition which has been
      handed down in Christopher Swetman's family for the last two hundred
      years.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <p>
      The traveller in school-books, who vouched in dryest tones for the
      fidelity to fact of the following narrative, used to add a ring of truth
      to it by opening with a nicety of criticism on the heroine's personality.
      People were wrong, he declared, when they surmised that Baptista Trewthen
      was a young woman with scarcely emotions or character. There was nothing
      in her to love, and nothing to hate-so ran the general opinion. That she
      showed few positive qualities was true. The colours and tones which
      changing events paint on the faces of active womankind were looked for in
      vain upon hers. But still waters run deep; and no crisis had come in the
      years of her early maidenhood to demonstrate what lay hidden within her,
      like metal in a mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was the daughter of a small farmer in St. Maria's, one of the Isles of
      Lyonesse beyond Off-Wessex, who had spent a large sum, as there
      understood, on her education, by sending her to the mainland for two
      years. At nineteen she was entered at the Training College for Teachers,
      and at twenty-one nominated to a school in the country, near Tor-upon-Sea,
      whither she proceeded after the Christmas examination and holidays.
    </p>
    <p>
      The months passed by from winter to spring and summer, and Baptista
      applied herself to her new duties as best she could, till an uneventful
      year had elapsed. Then an air of abstraction pervaded her bearing as she
      walked to and fro, twice a day, and she showed the traits of a person who
      had something on her mind. A widow, by name Mrs. Wace, in whose house
      Baptista Trewthen had been provided with a sitting-room and bedroom till
      the school-house should be built, noticed this change in her youthful
      tenant's manner, and at last ventured to press her with a few questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It has nothing to do with the place, nor with you,' said Miss Trewthen.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then it is the salary?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, nor the salary.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then it is something you have heard from home, my dear.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Baptista was silent for a few moments. 'It is Mr. Heddegan,' she murmured.
      'Him they used to call David Heddegan before he got his money.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And who is the Mr. Heddegan they used to call David?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'An old bachelor at Giant's Town, St. Maria's, with no relations whatever,
      who lives about a stone's throw from father's. When I was a child he used
      to take me on his knee and say he'd marry me some day. Now I am a woman
      the jest has turned earnest, and he is anxious to do it. And father and
      mother says I can't do better than have him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He's well off?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes-he's the richest man we know-as a friend and neighbour.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How much older did you say he was than yourself?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I didn't say. Twenty years at least.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And an unpleasant man in the bargain perhaps?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No-he's not unpleasant.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, child, all I can say is that I'd resist any such engagement if it's
      not palatable to 'ee. You are comfortable here, in my little house, I
      hope. All the parish like 'ee: and I've never been so cheerful, since my
      poor husband left me to wear his wings, as I've been with 'ee as my
      lodger.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The schoolmistress assured her landlady that she could return the
      sentiment. 'But here comes my perplexity,' she said. 'I don't like keeping
      school. Ah, you are surprised-you didn't suspect it. That's because I've
      concealed my feeling. Well, I simply hate school. I don't care for
      children-they are unpleasant, troublesome little things, whom nothing
      would delight so much as to hear that you had fallen down dead. Yet I
      would even put up with them if it was not for the inspector. For three
      months before his visit I didn't sleep soundly. And the Committee of
      Council are always changing the Code, so that you don't know what to
      teach, and what to leave untaught. I think father and mother are right.
      They say I shall never excel as a schoolmistress if I dislike the work so,
      and that therefore I ought to get settled by marrying Mr. Heddegan.
      Between us two, I like him better than school; but I don't like him quite
      so much as to wish to marry him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      These conversations, once begun, were continued from day to day; till at
      length the young girl's elderly friend and landlady threw in her opinion
      on the side of Miss Trewthen's parents. All things considered, she
      declared, the uncertainty of the school, the labour, Baptista's natural
      dislike for teaching, it would be as well to take what fate offered, and
      make the best of matters by wedding her father's old neighbour and
      prosperous friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Easter holidays came round, and Baptista went to spend them as usual
      in her native isle, going by train into Off-Wessex and crossing by packet
      from Pen-zephyr. When she returned in the middle of April her face wore a
      more settled aspect.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well?' said the expectant Mrs. Wace.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have agreed to have him as my husband,' said Baptista, in an off-hand
      way. 'Heaven knows if it will be for the best or not. But I have agreed to
      do it, and so the matter is settled.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wace commended her; but Baptista did not care to dwell on the
      subject; so that allusion to it was very infrequent between them.
      Nevertheless, among other things, she repeated to the widow from time to
      time in monosyllabic remarks that the wedding was really impending; that
      it was arranged for the summer, and that she had given notice of leaving
      the school at the August holidays. Later on she announced more
      specifically that her marriage was to take place immediately after her
      return home at the beginning of the month aforesaid.
    </p>
    <p>
      She now corresponded regularly with Mr. Heddegan. Her letters from him
      were seen, at least on the outside, and in part within, by Mrs. Wace. Had
      she read more of their interiors than the occasional sentences shown her
      by Baptista she would have perceived that the scratchy, rusty handwriting
      of Miss Trewthen's betrothed conveyed little more matter than details of
      their future housekeeping, and his preparations for the same, with
      innumerable 'my dears' sprinkled in disconnectedly, to show the depth of
      his affection without the inconveniences of syntax.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was the end of July-dry, too dry, even for the season, the delicate
      green herbs and vegetables that grew in this favoured end of the kingdom
      tasting rather of the watering-pot than of the pure fresh moisture from
      the skies. Baptista's boxes were packed, and one Saturday morning she
      departed by a waggonette to the station, and thence by train to Pen-
      zephyr, from which port she was, as usual, to cross the water immediately
      to her home, and become Mr. Heddegan's wife on the Wednesday of the week
      following.
    </p>
    <p>
      She might have returned a week sooner. But though the wedding day had
      loomed so near, and the banns were out, she delayed her departure till
      this last moment, saying it was not necessary for her to be at home long
      beforehand. As Mr. Heddegan was older than herself, she said, she was to
      be married in her ordinary summer bonnet and grey silk frock, and there
      were no preparations to make that had not been amply made by her parents
      and intended husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      In due time, after a hot and tedious journey, she reached Pen-zephyr. She
      here obtained some refreshment, and then went towards the pier, where she
      learnt to her surprise that the little steamboat plying between the town
      and the islands had left at eleven o'clock; the usual hour of departure in
      the afternoon having been forestalled in consequence of the fogs which had
      for a few days prevailed towards evening, making twilight navigation
      dangerous.
    </p>
    <p>
      This being Saturday, there was now no other boat till Tuesday, and it
      became obvious that here she would have to remain for the three days,
      unless her friends should think fit to rig out one of the island'
      sailing-boats and come to fetch her-a not very likely contingency, the sea
      distance being nearly forty miles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Baptista, however, had been detained in Pen-zephyr on more than one
      occasion before, either on account of bad weather or some such reason as
      the present, and she was therefore not in any personal alarm. But, as she
      was to be married on the following Wednesday, the delay was certainly
      inconvenient to a more than ordinary degree, since it would leave less
      than a day's interval between her arrival and the wedding ceremony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apart from this awkwardness she did not much mind the accident. It was
      indeed curious to see how little she minded. Perhaps it would not be too
      much to say that, although she was going to do the critical deed of her
      life quite willingly, she experienced an indefinable relief at the
      postponement of her meeting with Heddegan. But her manner after making
      discovery of the hindrance was quiet and subdued, even to passivity
      itself; as was instanced by her having, at the moment of receiving
      information that the steamer had sailed, replied 'Oh,' so coolly to the
      porter with her luggage, that he was almost disappointed at her lack of
      disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The question now was, should she return again to Mrs. Wace, in the village
      of Lower Wessex, or wait in the town at which she had arrived. She would
      have preferred to go back, but the distance was too great; moreover,
      having left the place for good, and somewhat dramatically, to become a
      bride, a return, even for so short a space, would have been a trifle
      humiliating.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving, then, her boxes at the station, her next anxiety was to secure a
      respectable, or rather genteel, lodging in the popular seaside resort
      confronting her. To this end she looked about the town, in which, though
      she had passed through it half-a-dozen times, she was practically a
      stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Baptista found a room to suit her over a fruiterer's shop; where she made
      herself at home, and set herself in order after her journey. An early cup
      of tea having revived her spirits she walked out to reconnoitre.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being a schoolmistress she avoided looking at the schools, and having a
      sort of trade connection with books, she avoided looking at the
      booksellers; but wearying of the other shops she inspected the churches;
      not that for her own part she cared much about ecclesiastical edifices;
      but tourists looked at them, and so would she-a proceeding for which no
      one would have credited her with any great originality, such, for
      instance, as that she subsequently showed herself to possess. The churches
      soon oppressed her. She tried the Museum, but came out because it seemed
      lonely and tedious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet the town and the walks in this land of strawberries, these
      headquarters of early English flowers and fruit, were then, as always,
      attractive. From the more picturesque streets she went to the town
      gardens, and the Pier, and the Harbour, and looked at the men at work
      there, loading and unloading as in the time of the Phoenicians.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not Baptista? Yes, Baptista it is!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The words were uttered behind her. Turning round she gave a start, and
      became confused, even agitated, for a moment. Then she said in her usual
      undemonstrative manner, 'O-is it really you, Charles?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Without speaking again at once, and with a half-smile, the new-comer
      glanced her over. There was much criticism, and some resentment-even
      temper-in his eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am going home,' continued she. 'But I have missed the boat.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He scarcely seemed to take in the meaning of this explanation, in the
      intensity of his critical survey. 'Teaching still? What a fine
      schoolmistress you make, Baptista, I warrant!' he said with a slight
      flavour of sarcasm, which was not lost upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I know I am nothing to brag of,' she replied. 'That's why I have given
      up.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O-given up? You astonish me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I hate the profession.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Perhaps that's because I am in it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no, it isn't. But I am going to enter on another life altogether. I am
      going to be married next week to Mr. David Heddegan.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man-fortified as he was by a natural cynical pride and
      passionateness-winced at this unexpected reply, notwithstanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who is Mr. David Heddegan?' he asked, as indifferently as lay in his
      power.
    </p>
    <p>
      She informed him the bearer of the name was a general merchant of Giant's
      Town, St. Maria's island-her father's nearest neighbour and oldest friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then we shan't see anything more of you on the mainland?' inquired the
      schoolmaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, I don't know about that,' said Miss Trewthen.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Here endeth the career of the belle of the boarding-school your father
      was foolish enough to send you to. A "general merchant's" wife in the
      Lyonesse Isles. Will you sell pounds of soap and pennyworths of tin tacks,
      or whole bars of saponaceous matter, and great tenpenny nails?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He's not in such a small way as that!' she almost pleaded. 'He owns
      ships, though they are rather little ones!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, well, it is much the same. Come, let us walk on; it is tedious to
      stand still. I thought you would be a failure in education,' he continued,
      when she obeyed him and strolled ahead. 'You never showed power that way.
      You remind me much of some of those women who think they are sure to be
      great actresses if they go on the stage, because they have a pretty face,
      and forget that what we require is acting. But you found your mistake,
      didn't you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't taunt me, Charles.' It was noticeable that the young schoolmaster's
      tone caused her no anger or retaliatory passion; far otherwise: there was
      a tear in her eye. 'How is it you are at Pen- zephyr?' she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't taunt you. I speak the truth, purely in a friendly way, as I
      should to any one I wished well. Though for that matter I might have some
      excuse even for taunting you. Such a terrible hurry as you've been in. I
      hate a woman who is in such a hurry.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How do you mean that?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why-to be somebody's wife or other-anything's wife rather than nobody's.
      You couldn't wait for me, O, no. Well, thank God, I'm cured of all that!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How merciless you are!' she said bitterly. 'Wait for you? What does that
      mean, Charley? You never showed-anything to wait for-anything special
      towards me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O come, Baptista dear; come!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What I mean is, nothing definite,' she expostulated. 'I suppose you liked
      me a little; but it seemed to me to be only a pastime on your part, and
      that you never meant to make an honourable engagement of it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'There, that's just it! You girls expect a man to mean business at the
      first look. No man when he first becomes interested in a woman has any
      definite scheme of engagement to marry her in his mind, unless he is
      meaning a vulgar mercenary marriage. However, I did at last mean an
      honourable engagement, as you call it, come to that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But you never said so, and an indefinite courtship soon injures a woman's
      position and credit, sooner than you think.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Baptista, I solemnly declare that in six months I should have asked you
      to marry me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She walked along in silence, looking on the ground, and appearing very
      uncomfortable. Presently he said, 'Would you have waited for me if you had
      known?' To this she whispered in a sorrowful whisper, 'Yes!'
    </p>
    <p>
      They went still farther in silence-passing along one of the beautiful
      walks on the outskirts of the town, yet not observant of scene or
      situation. Her shoulder and his were close together, and he clasped his
      fingers round the small of her arm-quite lightly, and without any attempt
      at impetus; yet the act seemed to say, 'Now I hold you, and my will must
      be yours.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Recurring to a previous question of hers he said, 'I have merely run down
      here for a day or two from school near Trufal, before going off to the
      north for the rest of my holiday. I have seen my relations at Redrutin
      quite lately, so I am not going there this time. How little I thought of
      meeting you! How very different the circumstances would have been if,
      instead of parting again as we must in half-an-hour or so, possibly for
      ever, you had been now just going off with me, as my wife, on our
      honeymoon trip. Ha-ha-well-so humorous is life!'
    </p>
    <p>
      She stopped suddenly. 'I must go back now-this is altogether too painful,
      Charley! It is not at all a kind mood you are in to-day.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't want to pain you-you know I do not,' he said more gently. 'Only
      it just exasperates me-this you are going to do. I wish you would not.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Marry him. There, now I have showed you my true sentiments.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I must do it now,' said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why?' he asked, dropping the off-hand masterful tone he had hitherto
      spoken in, and becoming earnest; still holding her arm, however, as if she
      were his chattel to be taken up or put down at will. 'It is never too late
      to break off a marriage that's distasteful to you. Now I'll say one thing;
      and it is truth: I wish you would marry me instead of him, even now, at
      the last moment, though you have served me so badly.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, it is not possible to think of that!' she answered hastily, shaking
      her head. 'When I get home all will be prepared-it is ready even now-the
      things for the party, the furniture, Mr. Heddegan's new suit, and
      everything. I should require the courage of a tropical lion to go home
      there and say I wouldn't carry out my promise!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then go, in Heaven's name! But there would be no necessity for you to go
      home and face them in that way. If we were to marry, it would have to be
      at once, instantly; or not at all. I should think your affection not worth
      the having unless you agreed to come back with me to Trufal this evening,
      where we could be married by licence on Monday morning. And then no Mr.
      David Heddegan or anybody else could get you away from me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I must go home by the Tuesday boat,' she faltered. 'What would they think
      if I did not come?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You could go home by that boat just the same. All the difference would be
      that I should go with you. You could leave me on the quay, where I'd have
      a smoke, while you went and saw your father and mother privately; you
      could then tell them what you had done, and that I was waiting not far
      off; that I was a school-master in a fairly good position, and a young man
      you had known when you were at the Training College. Then I would come
      boldly forward; and they would see that it could not be altered, and so
      you wouldn't suffer a lifelong misery by being the wife of a wretched old
      gaffer you don't like at all. Now, honestly; you do like me best, don't
      you, Baptista?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then we will do as I say.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not pronounce a clear affirmative. But that she consented to the
      novel proposition at some moment or other of that walk was apparent by
      what occurred a little later.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <p>
      An enterprise of such pith required, indeed, less talking than
      consideration. The first thing they did in carrying it out was to return
      to the railway station, where Baptista took from her luggage a small trunk
      of immediate necessaries which she would in any case have required after
      missing the boat. That same afternoon they travelled up the line to
      Trufal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles Stow (as his name was), despite his disdainful indifference to
      things, was very careful of appearances, and made the journey
      independently of her though in the same train. He told her where she could
      get board and lodgings in the city; and with merely a distant nod to her
      of a provisional kind, went off to his own quarters, and to see about the
      licence.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Sunday she saw him in the morning across the nave of the pro-
      cathedral. In the afternoon they walked together in the fields, where he
      told her that the licence would be ready next day, and would be available
      the day after, when the ceremony could be performed as early after eight
      o'clock as they should choose.
    </p>
    <p>
      His courtship, thus renewed after an interval of two years, was as
      impetuous, violent even, as it was short. The next day came and passed,
      and the final arrangements were made. Their agreement was to get the
      ceremony over as soon as they possibly could the next morning, so as to go
      on to Pen-zephyr at once, and reach that place in time for the boat's
      departure the same day. It was in obedience to Baptista's earnest request
      that Stow consented thus to make the whole journey to Lyonesse by land and
      water at one heat, and not break it at Pen-zephyr; she seemed to be
      oppressed with a dread of lingering anywhere, this great first act of
      disobedience to her parents once accomplished, with the weight on her mind
      that her home had to be convulsed by the disclosure of it. To face her
      difficulties over the water immediately she had created them was, however,
      a course more desired by Baptista than by her lover; though for once he
      gave way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning was bright and warm as those which had preceded it. By
      six o'clock it seemed nearly noon, as is often the case in that part of
      England in the summer season. By nine they were husband and wife. They
      packed up and departed by the earliest train after the service; and on the
      way discussed at length what she should say on meeting her parents,
      Charley dictating the turn of each phrase. In her anxiety they had
      travelled so early that when they reached Pen-zephyr they found there were
      nearly two hours on their hands before the steamer's time of sailing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Baptista was extremely reluctant to be seen promenading the streets of the
      watering-place with her husband till, as above stated, the household at
      Giant's Town should know the unexpected course of events from her own
      lips; and it was just possible, if not likely, that some Lyonessian might
      be prowling about there, or even have come across the sea to look for her.
      To meet any one to whom she was known, and to have to reply to awkward
      questions about the strange young man at her side before her well-framed
      announcement had been delivered at proper time and place, was a thing she
      could not contemplate with equanimity. So, instead of looking at the shops
      and harbour, they went along the coast a little way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The heat of the morning was by this time intense. They clambered up on
      some cliffs, and while sitting there, looking around at St. Michael's
      Mount and other objects, Charles said to her that he thought he would run
      down to the beach at their feet, and take just one plunge into the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Baptista did not much like the idea of being left alone; it was gloomy,
      she said. But he assured her he would not be gone more than a quarter of
      an hour at the outside, and she passively assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down he went, disappeared, appeared again, and looked back. Then he again
      proceeded, and vanished, till, as a small waxen object, she saw him emerge
      from the nook that had screened him, cross the white fringe of foam, and
      walk into the undulating mass of blue. Once in the water he seemed less
      inclined to hurry than before; he remained a long time; and, unable either
      to appreciate his skill or criticize his want of it at that distance, she
      withdrew her eyes from the spot, and gazed at the still outline of St.
      Michael's-now beautifully toned in grey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her anxiety for the hour of departure, and to cope at once with the
      approaching incidents that she would have to manipulate as best she could,
      sent her into a reverie. It was now Tuesday; she would reach home in the
      evening-a very late time they would say; but, as the delay was a pure
      accident, they would deem her marriage to Mr. Heddegan to- morrow still
      practicable. Then Charles would have to be produced from the background.
      It was a terrible undertaking to think of, and she almost regretted her
      temerity in wedding so hastily that morning. The rage of her father would
      be so crushing; the reproaches of her mother so bitter; and perhaps
      Charles would answer hotly, and perhaps cause estrangement till death.
      There had obviously been no alarm about her at St. Maria's, or somebody
      would have sailed across to inquire for her. She had, in a letter written
      at the beginning of the week, spoken of the hour at which she intended to
      leave her country schoolhouse; and from this her friends had probably
      perceived that by such timing she would run a risk of losing the Saturday
      boat. She had missed it, and as a consequence sat here on the shore as
      Mrs. Charles Stow.
    </p>
    <p>
      This brought her to the present, and she turned from the outline of St.
      Michael's Mount to look about for her husband's form. He was, as far as
      she could discover, no longer in the sea. Then he was dressing. By moving
      a few steps she could see where his clothes lay. But Charles was not
      beside them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Baptista looked back again at the water in bewilderment, as if her senses
      were the victim of some sleight of hand. Not a speck or spot resembling a
      man's head or face showed anywhere. By this time she was alarmed, and her
      alarm intensified when she perceived a little beyond the scene of her
      husband's bathing a small area of water, the quality of whose surface
      differed from that of the surrounding expanse as the coarse vegetation of
      some foul patch in a mead differs from the fine green of the remainder.
      Elsewhere it looked flexuous, here it looked vermiculated and lumpy, and
      her marine experiences suggested to her in a moment that two currents met
      and caused a turmoil at this place.
    </p>
    <p>
      She descended as hastily as her trembling limbs would allow. The way down
      was terribly long, and before reaching the heap of clothes it occurred to
      her that, after all, it would be best to run first for help. Hastening
      along in a lateral direction she proceeded inland till she met a man, and
      soon afterwards two others. To them she exclaimed, 'I think a gentleman
      who was bathing is in some danger. I cannot see him as I could. Will you
      please run and help him, at once, if you will be so kind?'
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not think of turning to show them the exact spot, indicating it
      vaguely by the direction of her hand, and still going on her way with the
      idea of gaining more assistance. When she deemed, in her faintness, that
      she had carried the alarm far enough, she faced about and dragged herself
      back again. Before reaching the now dreaded spot she met one of the men.
    </p>
    <p>
      'We can see nothing at all, Miss,' he declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having gained the beach, she found the tide in, and no sign of Charley's
      clothes. The other men whom she had besought to come had disappeared, it
      must have been in some other direction, for she had not met them going
      away. They, finding nothing, had probably thought her alarm a mere
      conjecture, and given up the quest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Baptista sank down upon the stones near at hand. Where Charley had
      undressed was now sea. There could not be the least doubt that he was
      drowned, and his body sucked under by the current; while his clothes,
      lying within high-water mark, had probably been carried away by the rising
      tide.
    </p>
    <p>
      She remained in a stupor for some minutes, till a strange sensation
      succeeded the aforesaid perceptions, mystifying her intelligence, and
      leaving her physically almost inert. With his personal disappearance, the
      last three days of her life with him seemed to be swallowed up, also his
      image, in her mind's eye, waned curiously, receded far away, grew stranger
      and stranger, less and less real. Their meeting and marriage had been so
      sudden, unpremeditated, adventurous, that she could hardly believe that
      she had played her part in such a reckless drama. Of all the few hours of
      her life with Charles, the portion that most insisted in coming back to
      memory was their fortuitous encounter on the previous Saturday, and those
      bitter reprimands with which he had begun the attack, as it might be
      called, which had piqued her to an unexpected consummation.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sort of cruelty, an imperiousness, even in his warmth, had characterized
      Charles Stow. As a lover he had ever been a bit of a tyrant; and it might
      pretty truly have been said that he had stung her into marriage with him
      at last. Still more alien from her life did these reflections operate to
      make him; and then they would be chased away by an interval of passionate
      weeping and mad regret. Finally, there returned upon the confused mind of
      the young wife the recollection that she was on her way homeward, and that
      the packet would sail in three-quarters of an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Except the parasol in her hand, all she possessed was at the station
      awaiting her onward journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked in that direction; and, entering one of those undemonstrative
      phases so common with her, walked quietly on.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first she made straight for the railway; but suddenly turning she went
      to a shop and wrote an anonymous line announcing his death by drowning to
      the only person she had ever heard Charles mention as a relative. Posting
      this stealthily, and with a fearful look around her, she seemed to acquire
      a terror of the late events, pursuing her way to the station as if
      followed by a spectre.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she got to the office she asked for the luggage that she had left
      there on the Saturday as well as the trunk left on the morning just
      lapsed. All were put in the boat, and she herself followed. Quickly as
      these things had been done, the whole proceeding, nevertheless, had been
      almost automatic on Baptista's part, ere she had come to any definite
      conclusion on her course.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just before the bell rang she heard a conversation on the pier, which
      removed the last shade of doubt from her mind, if any had existed, that
      she was Charles Stow's widow. The sentences were but fragmentary, but she
      could easily piece them out.
    </p>
    <p>
      'A man drowned-swam out too far-was a stranger to the place-people in
      boat-saw him go down-couldn't get there in time.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The news was little more definite than this as yet; though it may as well
      be stated once for all that the statement was true. Charley, with the
      over-confidence of his nature, had ventured out too far for his strength,
      and succumbed in the absence of assistance, his lifeless body being at
      that moment suspended in the transparent mid-depths of the bay. His
      clothes, however, had merely been gently lifted by the rising tide, and
      floated into a nook hard by, where they lay out of sight of the passers-by
      till a day or two after.

      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      In ten minutes they were steaming out of the harbour for their voyage of
      four or five hours, at whose ending she would have to tell her strange
      story.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Pen-zephyr and all its environing scenes disappeared behind Mousehole
      and St. Clement's Isle, Baptista's ephemeral, meteor-like husband
      impressed her yet more as a fantasy. She was still in such a trance- like
      state that she had been an hour on the little packet-boat before she
      became aware of the agitating fact that Mr. Heddegan was on board with
      her. Involuntarily she slipped from her left hand the symbol of her
      wifehood.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hee-hee! Well, the truth is, I wouldn't interrupt 'ee. "I reckon she
      don't see me, or won't see me," I said, "and what's the hurry? She'll see
      enough o' me soon!" I hope ye be well, mee deer?'
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a hale, well-conditioned man of about five and fifty, of the
      complexion common to those whose lives are passed on the bluffs and
      beaches of an ocean isle. He extended the four quarters of his face in a
      genial smile, and his hand for a grasp of the same magnitude. She gave her
      own in surprised docility, and he continued: 'I couldn't help coming
      across to meet 'ee. What an unfortunate thing you missing the boat and not
      coming Saturday! They meant to have warned 'ee that the time was changed,
      but forgot it at the last moment. The truth is that I should have informed
      'ee myself; but I was that busy finishing up a job last week, so as to
      have this week free, that I trusted to your father for attending to these
      little things. However, so plain and quiet as it is all to be, it really
      do not matter so much as it might otherwise have done, and I hope ye
      haven't been greatly put out. Now, if you'd sooner that I should not be
      seen talking to 'ee-if 'ee feel shy at all before strangers-just say. I'll
      leave 'ee to yourself till we get home.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Thank you much. I am indeed a little tired, Mr. Heddegan.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded urbane acquiescence, strolled away immediately, and minutely
      inspected the surface of the funnel, till some female passengers of
      Giant's Town tittered at what they must have thought a rebuff-for the
      approaching wedding was known to many on St. Maria's Island, though to
      nobody elsewhere. Baptista coloured at their satire, and called him back,
      and forced herself to commune with him in at least a mechanically friendly
      manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The opening event had been thus different from her expectation, and she
      had adumbrated no act to meet it. Taken aback she passively allowed
      circumstances to pilot her along; and so the voyage was made.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was near dusk when they touched the pier of Giant's Town, where several
      friends and neighbours stood awaiting them. Her father had a lantern in
      his hand. Her mother, too, was there, reproachfully glad that the delay
      had at last ended so simply. Mrs. Trewthen and her daughter went together
      along the Giant's Walk, or promenade, to the house, rather in advance of
      her husband and Mr. Heddegan, who talked in loud tones which reached the
      women over their shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some would have called Mrs. Trewthen a good mother; but though well
      meaning she was maladroit, and her intentions missed their mark. This
      might have been partly attributable to the slight deafness from which she
      suffered. Now, as usual, the chief utterances came from her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, yes, I'm so glad, my child, that you've got over safe. It is all
      ready, and everything so well arranged, that nothing but misfortune could
      hinder you settling as, with God's grace, becomes 'ee. Close to your
      mother's door a'most, 'twill be a great blessing, I'm sure; and I was very
      glad to find from your letters that you'd held your word sacred. That's
      right-make your word your bond always. Mrs. Wace seems to be a sensible
      woman. I hope the Lord will do for her as he's doing for you no long time
      hence. And how did 'ee get over the terrible journey from Tor-upon-Sea to
      Pen-zephyr? Once you'd done with the railway, of course, you seemed quite
      at home. Well, Baptista, conduct yourself seemly, and all will be well.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus admonished, Baptista entered the house, her father and Mr. Heddegan
      immediately at her back. Her mother had been so didactic that she had felt
      herself absolutely unable to broach the subjects in the centre of her
      mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The familiar room, with the dark ceiling, the well-spread table, the old
      chairs, had never before spoken so eloquently of the times ere she knew or
      had heard of Charley Stow. She went upstairs to take off her things, her
      mother remaining below to complete the disposition of the supper, and
      attend to the preparation of to-morrow's meal, altogether composing such
      an array of pies, from pies of fish to pies of turnips, as was never heard
      of outside the Western Duchy. Baptista, once alone, sat down and did
      nothing; and was called before she had taken off her bonnet.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'm coming,' she cried, jumping up, and speedily disapparelling herself,
      brushed her hair with a few touches and went down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two or three of Mr. Heddegan's and her father's friends had dropped in,
      and expressed their sympathy for the delay she had been subjected to. The
      meal was a most merry one except to Baptista. She had desired privacy, and
      there was none; and to break the news was already a greater difficulty
      than it had been at first. Everything around her, animate and inanimate,
      great and small, insisted that she had come home to be married; and she
      could not get a chance to say nay.
    </p>
    <p>
      One or two people sang songs, as overtures to the melody of the morrow,
      till at length bedtime came, and they all withdrew, her mother having
      retired a little earlier. When Baptista found herself again alone in her
      bedroom the case stood as before: she had come home with much to say, and
      she had said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now growing clear even to herself that Charles being dead, she had
      not determination sufficient within her to break tidings which, had he
      been alive, would have imperatively announced themselves. And thus with
      the stroke of midnight came the turning of the scale; her story should
      remain untold. It was not that upon the whole she thought it best not to
      attempt to tell it; but that she could not undertake so explosive a
      matter. To stop the wedding now would cause a convulsion in Giant's Town
      little short of volcanic. Weakened, tired, and terrified as she had been
      by the day's adventures, she could not make herself the author of such a
      catastrophe. But how refuse Heddegan without telling? It really seemed to
      her as if her marriage with Mr. Heddegan were about to take place as if
      nothing had intervened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morning came. The events of the previous days were cut off from her
      present existence by scene and sentiment more completely than ever.
      Charles Stow had grown to be a special being of whom, owing to his
      character, she entertained rather fearful than loving memory. Baptista
      could hear when she awoke that her parents were already moving about
      downstairs. But she did not rise till her mother's rather rough voice
      resounded up the staircase as it had done on the preceding evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Baptista! Come, time to be stirring! The man will be here, by heaven's
      blessing, in three-quarters of an hour. He has looked in already for a
      minute or two-and says he's going to the church to see if things be well
      forward.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Baptista arose, looked out of the window, and took the easy course. When
      she emerged from the regions above she was arrayed in her new silk frock
      and best stockings, wearing a linen jacket over the former for
      breakfasting, and her common slippers over the latter, not to spoil the
      new ones on the rough precincts of the dwelling.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is unnecessary to dwell at any great length on this part of the
      morning's proceedings. She revealed nothing; and married Heddegan, as she
      had given her word to do, on that appointed August day.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Heddegan forgave the coldness of his bride's manner during and after
      the wedding ceremony, full well aware that there had been considerable
      reluctance on her part to acquiesce in this neighbourly arrangement, and,
      as a philosopher of long standing, holding that whatever Baptista's
      attitude now, the conditions would probably be much the same six months
      hence as those which ruled among other married couples.
    </p>
    <p>
      An absolutely unexpected shock was given to Baptista's listless mind about
      an hour after the wedding service. They had nearly finished the mid-day
      dinner when the now husband said to her father, 'We think of starting
      about two. And the breeze being so fair we shall bring up inside
      Pen-zephyr new pier about six at least.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What-are we going to Pen-zephyr?' said Baptista. 'I don't know anything
      of it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Didn't you tell her?' asked her father of Heddegan.
    </p>
    <p>
      It transpired that, owing to the delay in her arrival, this proposal too,
      among other things, had in the hurry not been mentioned to her, except
      some time ago as a general suggestion that they would go somewhere.
      Heddegan had imagined that any trip would be pleasant, and one to the
      mainland the pleasantest of all.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked so distressed at the announcement that her husband willingly
      offered to give it up, though he had not had a holiday off the island for
      a whole year. Then she pondered on the inconvenience of staying at Giant's
      Town, where all the inhabitants were bonded, by the circumstances of their
      situation, into a sort of family party, which permitted and encouraged on
      such occasions as these oral criticism that was apt to disturb the
      equanimity of newly married girls, and would especially worry Baptista in
      her strange situation. Hence, unexpectedly, she agreed not to disorganize
      her husband's plans for the wedding jaunt, and it was settled that, as
      originally intended, they should proceed in a neighbour's sailing boat to
      the metropolis of the district.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this way they arrived at Pen-zephyr without difficulty or mishap.
      Bidding adieu to Jenkin and his man, who had sailed them over, they
      strolled arm in arm off the pier, Baptista silent, cold, and obedient.
      Heddegan had arranged to take her as far as Plymouth before their return,
      but to go no further than where they had landed that day. Their first
      business was to find an inn; and in this they had unexpected difficulty,
      since for some reason or other-possibly the fine weather-many of the
      nearest at hand were full of tourists and commercial travellers. He led
      her on till he reached a tavern which, though comparatively unpretending,
      stood in as attractive a spot as any in the town; and this, somewhat to
      their surprise after their previous experience, they found apparently
      empty. The considerate old man, thinking that Baptista was educated to
      artistic notions, though he himself was deficient in them, had decided
      that it was most desirable to have, on such an occasion as the present, an
      apartment with 'a good view' (the expression being one he had often heard
      in use among tourists); and he therefore asked for a favourite room on the
      first floor, from which a bow-window protruded, for the express purpose of
      affording such an outlook.
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlady, after some hesitation, said she was sorry that particular
      apartment was engaged; the next one, however, or any other in the house,
      was unoccupied.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The gentleman who has the best one will give it up to-morrow, and then
      you can change into it,' she added, as Mr. Heddegan hesitated about taking
      the adjoining and less commanding one.
    </p>
    <p>
      'We shall be gone to-morrow, and shan't want it,' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wishing not to lose customers, the landlady earnestly continued that since
      he was bent on having the best room, perhaps the other gentleman would not
      object to move at once into the one they despised, since, though nothing
      could be seen from the window, the room was equally large.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, if he doesn't care for a view,' said Mr. Heddegan, with the air of
      a highly artistic man who did.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no-I am sure he doesn't,' she said. 'I can promise that you shall have
      the room you want. If you would not object to go for a walk for half an
      hour, I could have it ready, and your things in it, and a nice tea laid in
      the bow-window by the time you come back?'
    </p>
    <p>
      This proposal was deemed satisfactory by the fussy old tradesman, and they
      went out. Baptista nervously conducted him in an opposite direction to her
      walk of the former day in other company, showing on her wan face, had he
      observed it, how much she was beginning to regret her sacrificial step for
      mending matters that morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took advantage of a moment when her husband's back was turned to
      inquire casually in a shop if anything had been heard of the gentleman who
      was sucked down in the eddy while bathing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shopman said, 'Yes, his body has been washed ashore,' and had just
      handed Baptista a newspaper on which she discerned the heading, 'A
      Schoolmaster drowned while bathing,' when her husband turned to join her.
      She might have pursued the subject without raising suspicion; but it was
      more than flesh and blood could do, and completing a small purchase almost
      ran out of the shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What is your terrible hurry, mee deer?' said Heddegan, hastening after.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't know-I don't want to stay in shops,' she gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And we won't,' he said. 'They are suffocating this weather. Let's go back
      and have some tay!'
    </p>
    <p>
      They found the much desired apartment awaiting their entry. It was a sort
      of combination bed and sitting-room, and the table was prettily spread
      with high tea in the bow-window, a bunch of flowers in the midst, and a
      best-parlour chair on each side. Here they shared the meal by the ruddy
      light of the vanishing sun. But though the view had been engaged,
      regardless of expense, exclusively for Baptista's pleasure, she did not
      direct any keen attention out of the window. Her gaze as often fell on the
      floor and walls of the room as elsewhere, and on the table as much as on
      either, beholding nothing at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was a change. Opposite her seat was the door, upon which her
      eyes presently became riveted like those of a little bird upon a snake.
      For, on a peg at the back of the door, there hung a hat; such a
      hat-surely, from its peculiar make, the actual hat-that had been worn by
      Charles. Conviction grew to certainty when she saw a railway ticket
      sticking up from the band. Charles had put the ticket there-she had
      noticed the act.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her teeth almost chattered; she murmured something incoherent. Her husband
      jumped up and said, 'You are not well! What is it? What shall I get 'ee?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Smelling salts!' she said, quickly and desperately; 'at that chemist's
      shop you were in just now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He jumped up like the anxious old man that he was, caught up his own hat
      from a back table, and without observing the other hastened out and
      downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Left alone she gazed and gazed at the back of the door, then spasmodically
      rang the bell. An honest-looking country maid-servant appeared in
      response.
    </p>
    <p>
      'A hat!' murmured Baptista, pointing with her finger. 'It does not belong
      to us.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O yes, I'll take it away,' said the young woman with some hurry. 'It
      belongs to the other gentleman.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke with a certain awkwardness, and took the hat out of the room.
      Baptista had recovered her outward composure. 'The other gentleman?' she
      said. 'Where is the other gentleman?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He's in the next room, ma'am. He removed out of this to oblige 'ee.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How can you say so? I should hear him if he were there,' said Baptista,
      sufficiently recovered to argue down an apparent untruth.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He's there,' said the girl, hardily.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then it is strange that he makes no noise,' said Mrs. Heddegan,
      convicting the girl of falsity by a look.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He makes no noise; but it is not strange,' said the servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once a dread took possession of the bride's heart, like a cold hand
      laid thereon; for it flashed upon her that there was a possibility of
      reconciling the girl's statement with her own knowledge of facts.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why does he make no noise?' she weakly said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The waiting-maid was silent, and looked at her questioner. 'If I tell you,
      ma'am, you won't tell missis?' she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Baptista promised.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Because he's a-lying dead!' said the girl. 'He's the schoolmaster that
      was drownded yesterday.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O!' said the bride, covering her eyes. 'Then he was in this room till
      just now?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' said the maid, thinking the young lady's agitation natural enough.
      'And I told missis that I thought she oughtn't to have done it, because I
      don't hold it right to keep visitors so much in the dark where death's
      concerned; but she said the gentleman didn't die of anything infectious;
      she was a poor, honest, innkeeper's wife, she says, who had to get her
      living by making hay while the sun sheened. And owing to the drownded
      gentleman being brought here, she said, it kept so many people away that
      we were empty, though all the other houses were full. So when your good
      man set his mind upon the room, and she would have lost good paying folk
      if he'd not had it, it wasn't to be supposed, she said, that she'd let
      anything stand in the way. Ye won't say that I've told ye, please, m'm?
      All the linen has been changed, and as the inquest won't be till
      to-morrow, after you are gone, she thought you wouldn't know a word of it,
      being strangers here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The returning footsteps of her husband broke off further narration.
      Baptista waved her hand, for she could not speak. The waiting-maid quickly
      withdrew, and Mr. Heddegan entered with the smelling salts and other
      nostrums.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Any better?' he questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't like the hotel,' she exclaimed, almost simultaneously. 'I can't
      bear it-it doesn't suit me!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is that all that's the matter?' he returned pettishly (this being the
      first time of his showing such a mood). 'Upon my heart and life such
      trifling is trying to any man's temper, Baptista! Sending me about from
      here to yond, and then when I come back saying 'ee don't like the place
      that I have sunk so much money and words to get for 'ee. 'Od dang it all,
      'tis enough to-But I won't say any more at present, mee deer, though it is
      just too much to expect to turn out of the house now. We shan't get
      another quiet place at this time of the evening-every other inn in the
      town is bustling with rackety folk of one sort and t'other, while here
      'tis as quiet as the grave-the country, I would say. So bide still, d'ye
      hear, and to-morrow we shall be out of the town altogether-as early as you
      like.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The obstinacy of age had, in short, overmastered its complaisance, and the
      young woman said no more. The simple course of telling him that in the
      adjoining room lay a corpse which had lately occupied their own might, it
      would have seemed, have been an effectual one without further disclosure,
      but to allude to that subject, however it was disguised, was more than
      Heddegan's young wife had strength for. Horror broke her down. In the
      contingency one thing only presented itself to her paralyzed regard-that
      here she was doomed to abide, in a hideous contiguity to the dead husband
      and the living, and her conjecture did, in fact, bear itself out. That
      night she lay between the two men she had married-Heddegan on the one
      hand, and on the other through the partition against which the bed stood,
      Charles Stow.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Kindly time had withdrawn the foregoing event three days from the present
      of Baptista Heddegan. It was ten o'clock in the morning; she had been ill,
      not in an ordinary or definite sense, but in a state of cold stupefaction,
      from which it was difficult to arouse her so much as to say a few
      sentences. When questioned she had replied that she was pretty well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their trip, as such, had been something of a failure. They had gone on as
      far as Falmouth, but here he had given way to her entreaties to return
      home. This they could not very well do without repassing through
      Pen-zephyr, at which place they had now again arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the train she had seen a weekly local paper, and read there a paragraph
      detailing the inquest on Charles. It was added that the funeral was to
      take place at his native town of Redrutin on Friday.
    </p>
    <p>
      After reading this she had shown no reluctance to enter the fatal
      neighbourhood of the tragedy, only stipulating that they should take their
      rest at a different lodging from the first; and now comparatively braced
      up and calm-indeed a cooler creature altogether than when last in the
      town, she said to David that she wanted to walk out for a while, as they
      had plenty of time on their hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      'To a shop as usual, I suppose, mee deer?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Partly for shopping,' she said. 'And it will be best for you, dear, to
      stay in after trotting about so much, and have a good rest while I am
      gone.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He assented; and Baptista sallied forth. As she had stated, her first
      visit was made to a shop, a draper's. Without the exercise of much choice
      she purchased a black bonnet and veil, also a black stuff gown; a black
      mantle she already wore. These articles were made up into a parcel which,
      in spite of the saleswoman's offers, her customer said she would take with
      her. Bearing it on her arm she turned to the railway, and at the station
      got a ticket for Redrutin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus it appeared that, on her recovery from the paralyzed mood of the
      former day, while she had resolved not to blast utterly the happiness of
      her present husband by revealing the history of the departed one, she had
      also determined to indulge a certain odd, inconsequent, feminine sentiment
      of decency, to the small extent to which it could do no harm to any
      person. At Redrutin she emerged from the railway carriage in the black
      attire purchased at the shop, having during the transit made the change in
      the empty compartment she had chosen. The other clothes were now in the
      bandbox and parcel. Leaving these at the cloak-room she proceeded onward,
      and after a wary survey reached the side of a hill whence a view of the
      burial ground could be obtained.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now a little before two o'clock. While Baptista waited a funeral
      procession ascended the road. Baptista hastened across, and by the time
      the procession entered the cemetery gates she had unobtrusively joined it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to the schoolmaster's own relatives (not a few), the paragraph
      in the newspapers of his death by drowning had drawn together many
      neighbours, acquaintances, and onlookers. Among them she passed unnoticed,
      and with a quiet step pursued the winding path to the chapel, and
      afterwards thence to the grave. When all was over, and the relatives and
      idlers had withdrawn, she stepped to the edge of the chasm. From beneath
      her mantle she drew a little bunch of forget-me- nots, and dropped them in
      upon the coffin. In a few minutes she also turned and went away from the
      cemetery. By five o'clock she was again in Pen-zephyr.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You have been a mortal long time!' said her husband, crossly. 'I allowed
      you an hour at most, mee deer.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It occupied me longer,' said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well-I reckon it is wasting words to complain. Hang it, ye look so tired
      and wisht that I can't find heart to say what I would!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am-weary and wisht, David; I am. We can get home to-morrow for certain,
      I hope?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'We can. And please God we will!' said Mr. Heddegan heartily, as if he too
      were weary of his brief honeymoon. 'I must be into business again on
      Monday morning at latest.'
    </p>
    <p>
      They left by the next morning steamer, and in the afternoon took up their
      residence in their own house at Giant's Town.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hour that she reached the island it was as if a material weight had
      been removed from Baptista's shoulders. Her husband attributed the change
      to the influence of the local breezes after the hot-house atmosphere of
      the mainland. However that might be, settled here, a few doors from her
      mother's dwelling, she recovered in no very long time much of her
      customary bearing, which was never very demonstrative. She accepted her
      position calmly, and faintly smiled when her neighbours learned to call
      her Mrs. Heddegan, and said she seemed likely to become the leader of
      fashion in Giant's Town.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband was a man who had made considerably more money by trade than
      her father had done: and perhaps the greater profusion of surroundings at
      her command than she had heretofore been mistress of, was not without an
      effect upon her. One week, two weeks, three weeks passed; and, being
      pre-eminently a young woman who allowed things to drift, she did nothing
      whatever either to disclose or conceal traces of her first marriage; or to
      learn if there existed possibilities-which there undoubtedly did-by which
      that hasty contract might become revealed to those about her at any
      unexpected moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      While yet within the first month of her marriage, and on an evening just
      before sunset, Baptista was standing within her garden adjoining the
      house, when she saw passing along the road a personage clad in a greasy
      black coat and battered tall hat, which, common enough in the slums of a
      city, had an odd appearance in St. Maria's. The tramp, as he seemed to be,
      marked her at once-bonnetless and unwrapped as she was her features were
      plainly recognizable-and with an air of friendly surprise came and leant
      over the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What! don't you know me?' said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had some dim recollection of his face, but said that she was not
      acquainted with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, your witness to be sure, ma'am. Don't you mind the man that was
      mending the church-window when you and your intended husband walked up to
      be made one; and the clerk called me down from the ladder, and I came and
      did my part by writing my name and occupation?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Baptista glanced quickly around; her husband was out of earshot. That
      would have been of less importance but for the fact that the wedding
      witnessed by this personage had not been the wedding with Mr. Heddegan,
      but the one on the day previous.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I've had a misfortune since then, that's pulled me under,' continued her
      friend. 'But don't let me damp yer wedded joy by naming the particulars.
      Yes, I've seen changes since; though 'tis but a short time ago-let me see,
      only a month next week, I think; for 'twere the first or second day in
      August.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes-that's when it was,' said another man, a sailor, who had come up with
      a pipe in his mouth, and felt it necessary to join in (Baptista having
      receded to escape further speech). 'For that was the first time I set foot
      in Giant's Town; and her husband took her to him the same day.'
    </p>
    <p>
      A dialogue then proceeded between the two men outside the wall, which
      Baptista could not help hearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ay, I signed the book that made her one flesh,' repeated the decayed
      glazier. 'Where's her goodman?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'About the premises somewhere; but you don't see 'em together much,'
      replied the sailor in an undertone. 'You see, he's older than she.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Older? I should never have thought it from my own observation,' said the
      glazier. 'He was a remarkably handsome man.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Handsome? Well, there he is-we can see for ourselves.'
    </p>
    <p>
      David Heddegan had, indeed, just shown himself at the upper end of the
      garden; and the glazier, looking in bewilderment from the husband to the
      wife, saw the latter turn pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that decayed glazier was a far-seeing and cunning man-too far-seeing
      and cunning to allow himself to thrive by simple and straightforward
      means-and he held his peace, till he could read more plainly the meaning
      of this riddle, merely adding carelessly, 'Well-marriage do alter a man,
      'tis true. I should never ha' knowed him!'
    </p>
    <p>
      He then stared oddly at the disconcerted Baptista, and moving on to where
      he could again address her, asked her to do him a good turn, since he once
      had done the same for her. Understanding that he meant money, she handed
      him some, at which he thanked her, and instantly went away.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      She had escaped exposure on this occasion; but the incident had been an
      awkward one, and should have suggested to Baptista that sooner or later
      the secret must leak out. As it was, she suspected that at any rate she
      had not heard the last of the glazier.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a day or two, when her husband had gone to the old town on the other
      side of the island, there came a gentle tap at the door, and the worthy
      witness of her first marriage made his appearance a second time.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It took me hours to get to the bottom of the mystery-hours!' he said with
      a gaze of deep confederacy which offended her pride very deeply. 'But
      thanks to a good intellect I've done it. Now, ma'am, I'm not a man to tell
      tales, even when a tale would be so good as this. But I'm going back to
      the mainland again, and a little assistance would be as rain on thirsty
      ground.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I helped you two days ago,' began Baptista.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes-but what was that, my good lady? Not enough to pay my passage to
      Pen-zephyr. I came over on your account, for I thought there was a mystery
      somewhere. Now I must go back on my own. Mind this-'twould be very awkward
      for you if your old man were to know. He's a queer temper, though he may
      be fond.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew as well as her visitor how awkward it would be; and the hush-
      money she paid was heavy that day. She had, however, the satisfaction of
      watching the man to the steamer, and seeing him diminish out of sight. But
      Baptista perceived that the system into which she had been led of
      purchasing silence thus was one fatal to her peace of mind, particularly
      if it had to be continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hearing no more from the glazier she hoped the difficulty was past. But
      another week only had gone by, when, as she was pacing the Giant's Walk
      (the name given to the promenade), she met the same personage in the
      company of a fat woman carrying a bundle.
    </p>
    <p>
      'This is the lady, my dear,' he said to his companion. 'This, ma'am, is my
      wife. We've come to settle in the town for a time, if so be we can find
      room.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That you won't do,' said she. 'Nobody can live here who is not
      privileged.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am privileged,' said the glazier, 'by my trade.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Baptista went on, but in the afternoon she received a visit from the man's
      wife. This honest woman began to depict, in forcible colours, the
      necessity for keeping up the concealment.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will intercede with my husband, ma'am,' she said. 'He's a true man if
      rightly managed; and I'll beg him to consider your position. 'Tis a very
      nice house you've got here,' she added, glancing round, 'and well worth a
      little sacrifice to keep it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The unlucky Baptista staved off the danger on this third occasion as she
      had done on the previous two. But she formed a resolve that, if the attack
      were once more to be repeated she would face a revelation-worse though
      that must now be than before she had attempted to purchase silence by
      bribes. Her tormentors, never believing her capable of acting upon such an
      intention, came again; but she shut the door in their faces. They
      retreated, muttering something; but she went to the back of the house,
      where David Heddegan was.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him, unconscious of all. The case was serious; she knew that
      well; and all the more serious in that she liked him better now than she
      had done at first. Yet, as she herself began to see, the secret was one
      that was sure to disclose itself. Her name and Charles's stood indelibly
      written in the registers; and though a month only had passed as yet it was
      a wonder that his clandestine union with her had not already been
      discovered by his friends. Thus spurring herself to the inevitable, she
      spoke to Heddegan.
    </p>
    <p>
      'David, come indoors. I have something to tell you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He hardly regarded her at first. She had discerned that during the last
      week or two he had seemed preoccupied, as if some private business
      harassed him. She repeated her request. He replied with a sigh, 'Yes,
      certainly, mee deer.'
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had reached the sitting-room and shut the door she repeated,
      faintly, 'David, I have something to tell you-a sort of tragedy I have
      concealed. You will hate me for having so far deceived you; but perhaps my
      telling you voluntarily will make you think a little better of me than you
      would do otherwise.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Tragedy?' he said, awakening to interest. 'Much you can know about
      tragedies, mee deer, that have been in the world so short a time!'
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw that he suspected nothing, and it made her task the harder. But on
      she went steadily. 'It is about something that happened before we were
      married,' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Indeed!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not a very long time before-a short time. And it is about a lover,' she
      faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't much mind that,' he said mildly. 'In truth, I was in hopes 'twas
      more.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'In hopes!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      This screwed her up to the necessary effort. 'I met my old sweetheart. He
      scorned me, chid me, dared me, and I went and married him. We were coming
      straight here to tell you all what we had done; but he was drowned; and I
      thought I would say nothing about him: and I married you, David, for the
      sake of peace and quietness. I've tried to keep it from you, but have
      found I cannot. There-that's the substance of it, and you can never, never
      forgive me, I am sure!'
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke desperately. But the old man, instead of turning black or blue,
      or slaying her in his indignation, jumped up from his chair, and began to
      caper around the room in quite an ecstatic emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, happy thing! How well it falls out!' he exclaimed, snapping his,
      fingers over his head. 'Ha-ha-the knot is cut-I see a way out of my
      trouble-ha-ha!' She looked at him without uttering a sound, till, as he
      still continued smiling joyfully, she said, 'O-what do you mean! Is it
      done to torment me?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No-no! O, mee deer, your story helps me out of the most heart-aching
      quandary a poor man ever found himself in! You see, it is this-I've got a
      tragedy, too; and unless you had had one to tell, I could never have seen
      my way to tell mine!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What is yours-what is it?' she asked, with altogether a new view of
      things.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well-it is a bouncer; mine is a bouncer!' said he, looking on the ground
      and wiping his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not worse than mine?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well-that depends upon how you look at it. Yours had to do with the past
      alone; and I don't mind it. You see, we've been married a month, and it
      don't jar upon me as it would if we'd only been married a day or two. Now
      mine refers to past, present, and future; so that-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Past, present, and future!' she murmured. 'It never occurred to me that
      you had a tragedy, too.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But I have!' he said, shaking his head. 'In fact, four.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then tell 'em!' cried the young woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will-I will. But be considerate, I beg 'ee, mee deer. Well-I wasn't a
      bachelor when I married 'ee, any more than you were a spinster. Just as
      you was a widow-woman, I was a widow-man.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah!' said she, with some surprise. 'But is that all?-then we are nicely
      balanced,' she added, relieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No-it is not all. There's the point. I am not only a widower.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, David!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am a widower with four tragedies-that is to say, four strapping
      girls-the eldest taller than you. Don't 'ee look so struck-dumb-like! It
      fell out in this way. I knew the poor woman, their mother, in Pen- zephyr
      for some years; and-to cut a long story short-I privately married her at
      last, just before she died. I kept the matter secret, but it is getting
      known among the people here by degrees. I've long felt for the
      children-that it is my duty to have them here, and do something for them.
      I have not had courage to break it to 'ee, but I've seen lately that it
      would soon come to your ears, and that hev worried me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Are they educated?' said the ex-schoolmistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No. I am sorry to say they have been much neglected; in truth, they can
      hardly read. And so I thought that by marrying a young schoolmistress I
      should get some one in the house who could teach 'em, and bring 'em into
      genteel condition, all for nothing. You see, they are growed up too tall
      to be sent to school.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, mercy!' she almost moaned. 'Four great girls to teach the rudiments
      to, and have always in the house with me spelling over their books; and I
      hate teaching, it kills me. I am bitterly punished-I am, I am!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You'll get used to 'em, mee deer, and the balance of secrets-mine against
      yours-will comfort your heart with a sense of justice. I could send for
      'em this week very well-and I will! In faith, I could send this very day.
      Baptista, you have relieved me of all my difficulty!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the interview ended, so far as this matter was concerned. Baptista
      was too stupefied to say more, and when she went away to her room she wept
      from very mortification at Mr. Heddegan's duplicity. Education, the one
      thing she abhorred; the shame of it to delude a young wife so!
    </p>
    <p>
      The next meal came round. As they sat, Baptista would not suffer her eyes
      to turn towards him. He did not attempt to intrude upon her reserve, but
      every now and then looked under the table and chuckled with satisfaction
      at the aspect of affairs. 'How very well matched we be!' he said,
      comfortably.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day, when the steamer came in, Baptista saw her husband rush down to
      meet it; and soon after there appeared at her door four tall, hipless,
      shoulderless girls, dwindling in height and size from the eldest to the
      youngest, like a row of Pan pipes; at the head of them standing Heddegan.
      He smiled pleasantly through the grey fringe of his whiskers and beard,
      and turning to the girls said, 'Now come forrard, and shake hands properly
      with your stepmother.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus she made their acquaintance, and he went out, leaving them together.
      On examination the poor girls turned out to be not only plain-looking,
      which she could have forgiven, but to have such a lamentably meagre
      intellectual equipment as to be hopelessly inadequate as companions. Even
      the eldest, almost her own age, could only read with difficulty words of
      two syllables; and taste in dress was beyond their comprehension. In the
      long vista of future years she saw nothing but dreary drudgery at her
      detested old trade without prospect of reward.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went about quite despairing during the next few days-an unpromising,
      unfortunate mood for a woman who had not been married six weeks. From her
      parents she concealed everything. They had been amongst the few
      acquaintances of Heddegan who knew nothing of his secret, and were
      indignant enough when they saw such a ready-made household foisted upon
      their only child. But she would not support them in their remonstrances.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, you don't yet know all,' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus Baptista had sense enough to see the retributive fairness of this
      issue. For some time, whenever conversation arose between her and
      Heddegan, which was not often, she always said, 'I am miserable, and you
      know it. Yet I don't wish things to be otherwise.'
    </p>
    <p>
      But one day when he asked, 'How do you like 'em now?' her answer was
      unexpected. 'Much better than I did,' she said, quietly. 'I may like them
      very much some day.'
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the beginning of a serener season for the chastened spirit of
      Baptista Heddegan. She had, in truth, discovered, underneath the crust of
      uncouthness and meagre articulation which was due to their Troglodytean
      existence, that her unwelcomed daughters had natures that were unselfish
      almost to sublimity. The harsh discipline accorded to their young lives
      before their mother's wrong had been righted, had operated less to crush
      them than to lift them above all personal ambition. They considered the
      world and its contents in a purely objective way, and their own lot seemed
      only to affect them as that of certain human beings among the rest, whose
      troubles they knew rather than suffered.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was such an entirely new way of regarding life to a woman of
      Baptista's nature, that her attention, from being first arrested by it,
      became deeply interested. By imperceptible pulses her heart expanded in
      sympathy with theirs. The sentences of her tragi-comedy, her life,
      confused till now, became clearer daily. That in humanity, as exemplified
      by these girls, there was nothing to dislike, but infinitely much to pity,
      she learnt with the lapse of each week in their company. She grew to like
      the girls of unpromising exterior, and from liking she got to love them;
      till they formed an unexpected point of junction between her own and her
      husband's interests, generating a sterling friendship at least, between a
      pair in whose existence there had threatened to be neither friendship nor
      love.

    <h2>
      PREFACE
    </h2>
    <p>
      This somewhat frivolous narrative was produced as an interlude between
      stories of a more sober design, and it was given the sub-title of a comedy
      to indicate-though not quite accurately-the aim of the performance. A high
      degree of probability was not attempted in the arrangement of the
      incidents, and there was expected of the reader a certain lightness of
      mood, which should inform him with a good-natured willingness to accept
      the production in the spirit in which it was offered. The characters
      themselves, however, were meant to be consistent and human.
    </p>
    <p>
      On its first appearance the novel suffered, perhaps deservedly, for what
      was involved in these intentions-for its quality of unexpectedness in
      particular-that unforgivable sin in the critic's sight-the immediate
      precursor of 'Ethelberta' having been a purely rural tale. Moreover, in
      its choice of medium, and line of perspective, it undertook a delicate
      task: to excite interest in a drama-if such a dignified word may be used
      in the connection-wherein servants were as important as, or more important
      than, their masters; wherein the drawing-room was sketched in many cases
      from the point of view of the servants' hall. Such a reversal of the
      social foreground has, perhaps, since grown more welcome, and readers even
      of the finer crusted kind may now be disposed to pardon a writer for
      presenting the sons and daughters of Mr. and Mrs. Chickerel as beings who
      come within the scope of a congenial regard.

    <h2>
      1. A STREET IN ANGLEBURY-A HEATH NEAR IT-INSIDE THE 'RED LION' INN
    </h2>
    <p>
      Young Mrs. Petherwin stepped from the door of an old and well-appointed
      inn in a Wessex town to take a country walk. By her look and carriage she
      appeared to belong to that gentle order of society which has no worldly
      sorrow except when its jewellery gets stolen; but, as a fact not generally
      known, her claim to distinction was rather one of brains than of blood.
      She was the daughter of a gentleman who lived in a large house not his
      own, and began life as a baby christened Ethelberta after an infant of
      title who does not come into the story at all, having merely furnished
      Ethelberta's mother with a subject of contemplation. She became teacher in
      a school, was praised by examiners, admired by gentlemen, not admired by
      gentlewomen, was touched up with accomplishments by masters who were
      coaxed into painstaking by her many graces, and, entering a mansion as
      governess to the daughter thereof, was stealthily married by the son. He,
      a minor like herself, died from a chill caught during the wedding tour,
      and a few weeks later was followed into the grave by Sir Ralph Petherwin,
      his unforgiving father, who had bequeathed his wealth to his wife
      absolutely.
    </p>
    <p>
      These calamities were a sufficient reason to Lady Petherwin for pardoning
      all concerned. She took by the hand the forlorn Ethelberta-who seemed
      rather a detached bride than a widow-and finished her education by placing
      her for two or three years in a boarding-school at Bonn. Latterly she had
      brought the girl to England to live under her roof as daughter and
      companion, the condition attached being that Ethelberta was never openly
      to recognize her relations, for reasons which will hereafter appear.
    </p>
    <p>
      The elegant young lady, as she had a full right to be called if she cared
      for the definition, arrested all the local attention when she emerged into
      the summer-evening light with that diadem-and-sceptre bearing-many people
      for reasons of heredity discovering such graces only in those whose
      vestibules are lined with ancestral mail, forgetting that a bear may be
      taught to dance. While this air of hers lasted, even the inanimate objects
      in the street appeared to know that she was there; but from a way she had
      of carelessly overthrowing her dignity by versatile moods, one could not
      calculate upon its presence to a certainty when she was round corners or
      in little lanes which demanded no repression of animal spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well to be sure!' exclaimed a milkman, regarding her. 'We should freeze
      in our beds if 'twere not for the sun, and, dang me! if she isn't a pretty
      piece. A man could make a meal between them eyes and chin-eh, hostler? Odd
      nation dang my old sides if he couldn't!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The speaker, who had been carrying a pair of pails on a yoke, deposited
      them upon the edge of the pavement in front of the inn, and straightened
      his back to an excruciating perpendicular. His remarks had been addressed
      to a rickety person, wearing a waistcoat of that preternatural length from
      the top to the bottom button which prevails among men who have to do with
      horses. He was sweeping straws from the carriage-way beneath the stone
      arch that formed a passage to the stables behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never mind the cursing and swearing, or somebody who's never out of
      hearing may clap yer name down in his black book,' said the hostler, also
      pausing, and lifting his eyes to the mullioned and transomed windows and
      moulded parapet above him-not to study them as features of ancient
      architecture, but just to give as healthful a stretch to the eyes as his
      acquaintance had done to his back. 'Michael, a old man like you ought to
      think about other things, and not be looking two ways at your time of
      life. Pouncing upon young flesh like a carrion crow-'tis a vile thing in a
      old man.'
    </p>
    <p>
      ''Tis; and yet 'tis not, for 'tis a naterel taste,' said the milkman,
      again surveying Ethelberta, who had now paused upon a bridge in full view,
      to look down the river. 'Now, if a poor needy feller like myself could
      only catch her alone when she's dressed up to the nines for some grand
      party, and carry her off to some lonely place-sakes, what a pot of jewels
      and goold things I warrant he'd find about her! 'Twould pay en for his
      trouble.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't dispute the picter; but 'tis sly and untimely to think such
      roguery. Though I've had thoughts like it, 'tis true, about high
      women-Lord forgive me for't.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And that figure of fashion standing there is a widow woman, so I hear?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lady-not a penny less than lady. Ay, a thing of twenty-one or
      thereabouts.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A widow lady and twenty-one. 'Tis a backward age for a body who's so
      forward in her state of life.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, be that as 'twill, here's my showings for her age. She was about
      the figure of two or three-and-twenty when a' got off the carriage last
      night, tired out wi' boaming about the country; and nineteen this morning
      when she came downstairs after a sleep round the clock and a clane-washed
      face: so I thought to myself, twenty-one, I thought.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And what's the young woman's name, make so bold, hostler?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ay, and the house were all in a stoor with her and the old woman, and
      their boxes and camp-kettles, that they carry to wash in because
      hand-basons bain't big enough, and I don't know what all; and t'other folk
      stopping here were no more than dirt thencefor'ard.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I suppose they've come out of some noble city a long way herefrom?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And there was her hair up in buckle as if she'd never seen a clay-cold
      man at all. However, to cut a long story short, all I know besides about
      'em is that the name upon their luggage is Lady Petherwin, and she's the
      widow of a city gentleman, who was a man of valour in the Lord Mayor's
      Show.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who's that chap in the gaiters and pack at his back, come out of the door
      but now?' said the milkman, nodding towards a figure of that description
      who had just emerged from the inn and trudged off in the direction taken
      by the lady-now out of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Chap in the gaiters? Chok' it all-why, the father of that nobleman that
      you call chap in the gaiters used to be hand in glove with half the
      Queen's court.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What d'ye tell o'?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That man's father was one of the mayor and corporation of Sandbourne, and
      was that familiar with men of money, that he'd slap 'em upon the shoulder
      as you or I or any other poor fool would the clerk of the parish.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, what's my lordlin's name, make so bold, then?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ay, the toppermost class nowadays have left off the use of wheels for the
      good of their constitutions, so they traipse and walk for many years up
      foreign hills, where you can see nothing but snow and fog, till there's no
      more left to walk up; and if they reach home alive, and ha'n't got too old
      and weared out, they walk and see a little of their own parishes. So they
      tower about with a pack and a stick and a clane white pocket-handkerchief
      over their hats just as you see he's got on his. He's been staying here a
      night, and is off now again. "Young man, young man," I think to myself,
      "if your shoulders were bent like a bandy and your knees bowed out as mine
      be, till there is not an inch of straight bone or gristle in 'ee, th'
      wouldstn't go doing hard work for play 'a b'lieve."'
    </p>
    <p>
      'True, true, upon my song. Such a pain as I have had in my lynes all this
      day to be sure; words don't know what shipwreck I suffer in these lynes o'
      mine-that they do not! And what was this young widow lady's maiden name,
      then, hostler? Folk have been peeping after her, that's true; but they
      don't seem to know much about her family.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And while I've tended horses fifty year that other folk might straddle
      'em, here I be now not a penny the better! Often-times, when I see so many
      good things about, I feel inclined to help myself in common justice to my
      pocket.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    "Work hard and be poor,
    Do nothing and get more."
</pre>
    <p>
      But I draw in the horns of my mind and think to myself, "Forbear, John
      Hostler, forbear!"-Her maiden name? Faith, I don't know the woman's maiden
      name, though she said to me, "Good evening, John;" but I had no memory of
      ever seeing her afore-no, no more than the dead inside church-hatch-where
      I shall soon be likewise-I had not. "Ay, my nabs," I think to myself,
      "more know Tom Fool than Tom Fool knows."'
    </p>
    <p>
      'More know Tom Fool-what rambling old canticle is it you say, hostler?'
      inquired the milkman, lifting his ear. 'Let's have it again-a good saying
      well spit out is a Christmas fire to my withered heart. More know Tom
      Fool-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Than Tom Fool knows,' said the hostler.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah! That's the very feeling I've feeled over and over again, hostler, but
      not in such gifted language. 'Tis a thought I've had in me for years, and
      never could lick into shape!-O-ho-ho-ho! Splendid! Say it again, hostler,
      say it again! To hear my own poor notion that had no name brought into
      form like that-I wouldn't ha' lost it for the world! More know Tom Fool
      than-than-h-ho-ho-ho-ho!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't let your sense o' vitness break out in such uproar, for heaven's
      sake, or folk will surely think you've been laughing at the lady and
      gentleman. Well, here's at it again-Night t'ee, Michael.' And the hostler
      went on with his sweeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Night t'ee, hostler, I must move too,' said the milkman, shouldering his
      yoke, and walking off; and there reached the inn in a gradual diminuendo,
      as he receded up the street, shaking his head convulsively, 'More know-Tom
      Fool-than Tom Fool-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The 'Red Lion,' as the inn or hotel was called which of late years had
      become the fashion among tourists, because of the absence from its
      precincts of all that was fashionable and new, stood near the middle of
      the town, and formed a corner where in winter the winds whistled and
      assembled their forces previous to plunging helter-skelter along the
      streets. In summer it was a fresh and pleasant spot, convenient for such
      quiet characters as sojourned there to study the geology and beautiful
      natural features of the country round.

    <p>
      The lady whose appearance had asserted a difference between herself and
      the Anglebury people, without too clearly showing what that difference
      was, passed out of the town in a few moments and, following the highway
      across meadows fed by the Froom, she crossed the railway and soon got into
      a lonely heath. She had been watching the base of a cloud as it closed
      down upon the line of a distant ridge, like an upper upon a lower eyelid,
      shutting in the gaze of the evening sun. She was about to return before
      dusk came on, when she heard a commotion in the air immediately behind and
      above her head. The saunterer looked up and saw a wild-duck flying along
      with the greatest violence, just in its rear being another large bird,
      which a countryman would have pronounced to be one of the biggest
      duck-hawks that he had ever beheld. The hawk neared its intended victim,
      and the duck screamed and redoubled its efforts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta impulsively started off in a rapid run that would have made a
      little dog bark with delight and run after, her object being, if possible,
      to see the end of this desperate struggle for a life so small and
      unheard-of. Her stateliness went away, and it could be forgiven for not
      remaining; for her feet suddenly became as quick as fingers, and she raced
      along over the uneven ground with such force of tread that, being a woman
      slightly heavier than gossamer, her patent heels punched little D's in the
      soil with unerring accuracy wherever it was bare, crippled the
      heather-twigs where it was not, and sucked the swampy places with a sound
      of quick kisses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her rate of advance was not to be compared with that of the two birds,
      though she went swiftly enough to keep them well in sight in such an open
      place as that around her, having at one point in the journey been so near
      that she could hear the whisk of the duck's feathers against the wind as
      it lifted and lowered its wings. When the bird seemed to be but a few
      yards from its enemy she saw it strike downwards, and after a level flight
      of a quarter of a minute, vanish. The hawk swooped after, and Ethelberta
      now perceived a whitely shining oval of still water, looking amid the
      swarthy level of the heath like a hole through to a nether sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Into this large pond, which the duck had been making towards from the
      beginning of its precipitate flight, it had dived out of sight. The
      excited and breathless runner was in a few moments close enough to see the
      disappointed hawk hovering and floating in the air as if waiting for the
      reappearance of its prey, upon which grim pastime it was so intent that by
      creeping along softly she was enabled to get very near the edge of the
      pool and witness the conclusion of the episode. Whenever the duck was
      under the necessity of showing its head to breathe, the other bird would
      dart towards it, invariably too late, however; for the diver was far too
      experienced in the rough humour of the buzzard family at this game to come
      up twice near the same spot, unaccountably emerging from opposite sides of
      the pool in succession, and bobbing again by the time its adversary
      reached each place, so that at length the hawk gave up the contest and
      flew away, a satanic moodiness being almost perceptible in the motion of
      its wings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young lady now looked around her for the first time, and began to
      perceive that she had run a long distance-very much further than she had
      originally intended to come. Her eyes had been so long fixed upon the
      hawk, as it soared against the bright and mottled field of sky, that on
      regarding the heather and plain again it was as if she had returned to a
      half-forgotten region after an absence, and the whole prospect was
      darkened to one uniform shade of approaching night. She began at once to
      retrace her steps, but having been indiscriminately wheeling round the
      pond to get a good view of the performance, and having followed no path
      thither, she found the proper direction of her journey to be a matter of
      some uncertainty.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Surely,' she said to herself, 'I faced the north at starting:' and yet on
      walking now with her back where her face had been set, she did not
      approach any marks on the horizon which might seem to signify the town.
      Thus dubiously, but with little real concern, she walked on till the
      evening light began to turn to dusk, and the shadows to darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently in front of her Ethelberta saw a white spot in the shade, and it
      proved to be in some way attached to the head of a man who was coming
      towards her out of a slight depression in the ground. It was as yet too
      early in the evening to be afraid, but it was too late to be altogether
      courageous; and with balanced sensations Ethelberta kept her eye sharply
      upon him as he rose by degrees into view. The peculiar arrangement of his
      hat and pugree soon struck her as being that she had casually noticed on a
      peg in one of the rooms of the 'Red Lion,' and when he came close she saw
      that his arms diminished to a peculiar smallness at their junction with
      his shoulders, like those of a doll, which was explained by their being
      girt round at that point with the straps of a knapsack that he carried
      behind him. Encouraged by the probability that he, like herself, was
      staying or had been staying at the 'Red Lion,' she said, 'Can you tell me
      if this is the way back to Anglebury?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is one way; but the nearest is in this direction,' said the
      tourist-the same who had been criticized by the two old men.
    </p>
    <p>
      At hearing him speak all the delicate activities in the young lady's
      person stood still: she stopped like a clock. When she could again fence
      with the perception which had caused all this, she breathed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr. Julian!' she exclaimed. The words were uttered in a way which would
      have told anybody in a moment that here lay something connected with the
      light of other days.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, Mrs. Petherwin!-Yes, I am Mr. Julian-though that can matter very
      little, I should think, after all these years, and what has passed.'
    </p>
    <p>
      No remark was returned to this rugged reply, and he continued
      unconcernedly, 'Shall I put you in the path-it is just here?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If you please.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Come with me, then.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She walked in silence at his heels, not a word passing between them all
      the way: the only noises which came from the two were the brushing of her
      dress and his gaiters against the heather, or the smart rap of a stray
      flint against his boot.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had now reached a little knoll, and he turned abruptly: 'That is
      Anglebury-just where you see those lights. The path down there is the one
      you must follow; it leads round the hill yonder and directly into the
      town.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Thank you,' she murmured, and found that he had never removed his eyes
      from her since speaking, keeping them fixed with mathematical exactness
      upon one point in her face. She moved a little to go on her way; he moved
      a little less-to go on his.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good-night,' said Mr. Julian.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment, upon the very face of it, was critical; and yet it was one of
      those which have to wait for a future before they acquire a definite
      character as good or bad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus much would have been obvious to any outsider; it may have been doubly
      so to Ethelberta, for she gave back more than she had got, replying,
      'Good-bye-if you are going to say no more.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Then in struck Mr. Julian: 'What can I say? You are nothing to me. . . . I
      could forgive a woman doing anything for spite, except marrying for
      spite.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The connection of that with our present meeting does not appear, unless
      it refers to what you have done. It does not refer to me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am not married: you are.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not contradict him, as she might have done. 'Christopher,' she
      said at last, 'this is how it is: you knew too much of me to respect me,
      and too little to pity me. A half knowledge of another's life mostly does
      injustice to the life half known.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then since circumstances forbid my knowing you more, I must do my best to
      know you less, and elevate my opinion of your nature by forgetting what it
      consists in,' he said in a voice from which all feeling was polished away.
    </p>
    <p>
      'If I did not know that bitterness had more to do with those words than
      judgment, I-should be-bitter too! You never knew half about me; you only
      knew me as a governess; you little think what my beginnings were.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have guessed. I have many times told myself that your early life was
      superior to your position when I first met you. I think I may say without
      presumption that I recognize a lady by birth when I see her, even under
      reverses of an extreme kind. And certainly there is this to be said, that
      the fact of having been bred in a wealthy home does slightly redeem an
      attempt to attain to such a one again.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta smiled a smile of many meanings.
    </p>
    <p>
      'However, we are wasting words,' he resumed cheerfully. 'It is better for
      us to part as we met, and continue to be the strangers that we have become
      to each other. I owe you an apology for having been betrayed into more
      feeling than I had a right to show, and let us part friends. Good night,
      Mrs. Petherwin, and success to you. We may meet again, some day, I hope.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good night,' she said, extending her hand. He touched it, turned about,
      and in a short time nothing remained of him but quick regular brushings
      against the heather in the deep broad shadow of the moor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta slowly moved on in the direction that he had pointed out. This
      meeting had surprised her in several ways. First, there was the
      conjuncture itself; but more than that was the fact that he had not parted
      from her with any of the tragic resentment that she had from time to time
      imagined for that scene if it ever occurred. Yet there was really nothing
      wonderful in this: it is part of the generous nature of a bachelor to be
      not indisposed to forgive a portionless sweetheart who, by marrying
      elsewhere, has deprived him of the bliss of being obliged to marry her
      himself. Ethelberta would have been disappointed quite had there not been
      a comforting development of exasperation in the middle part of his talk;
      but after all it formed a poor substitute for the loving hatred she had
      expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she reached the hotel the lamp over the door showed a face a little
      flushed, but the agitation which at first had possessed her was gone to a
      mere nothing. In the hall she met a slender woman wearing a silk dress of
      that peculiar black which in sunlight proclaims itself to have once seen
      better days as a brown, and days even better than those as a lavender,
      green, or blue.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Menlove,' said the lady, 'did you notice if any gentleman observed and
      followed me when I left the hotel to go for a walk this evening?'
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady's-maid, thus suddenly pulled up in a night forage after lovers,
      put a hand to her forehead to show that there was no mistake about her
      having begun to meditate on receiving orders to that effect, and said at
      last, 'You once told me, ma'am, if you recollect, that when you were
      dressed, I was not to go staring out of the window after you as if you
      were a doll I had just manufactured and sent round for sale.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, so I did.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'So I didn't see if anybody followed you this evening.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then did you hear any gentleman arrive here by the late train last
      night?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no, ma'am-how could I?' said Mrs. Menlove-an exclamation which was more
      apposite than her mistress suspected, considering that the speaker, after
      retiring from duty, had slipped down her dark skirt to reveal a light,
      puffed, and festooned one, put on a hat and feather, together with several
      pennyweights of metal in the form of rings, brooches, and earrings-all in
      a time whilst one could count a hundred-and enjoyed half-an-hour of prime
      courtship by an honourable young waiter of the town, who had proved
      constant as the magnet to the pole for the space of the day and a half
      that she had known him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Going at once upstairs, Ethelberta ran down the passage, and after some
      hesitation softly opened the door of the sitting-room in the best suite of
      apartments that the inn could boast of.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this room sat an elderly lady writing by the light of two candles with
      green shades. Well knowing, as it seemed, who the intruder was, she
      continued her occupation, and her visitor advanced and stood beside the
      table. The old lady wore her spectacles low down her cheek, her glance
      being depressed to about the slope of her straight white nose in order to
      look through them. Her mouth was pursed up to almost a youthful shape as
      she formed the letters with her pen, and a slight move of the lip
      accompanied every downstroke. There were two large antique rings on her
      forefinger, against which the quill rubbed in moving backwards and
      forwards, thereby causing a secondary noise rivalling the primary one of
      the nib upon the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mamma,' said the younger lady, 'here I am at last.'
    </p>
    <p>
      A writer's mind in the midst of a sentence being like a ship at sea,
      knowing no rest or comfort till safely piloted into the harbour of a full
      stop, Lady Petherwin just replied with 'What,' in an occupied tone, not
      rising to interrogation. After signing her name to the letter, she raised
      her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, how late you are, Ethelberta, and how heated you look!' she said. 'I
      have been quite alarmed about you. What do you say has happened?'
    </p>
    <p>
      The great, chief, and altogether eclipsing thing that had happened was the
      accidental meeting with an old lover whom she had once quarrelled with;
      and Ethelberta's honesty would have delivered the tidings at once, had
      not, unfortunately, all the rest of her attributes been dead against that
      act, for the old lady's sake even more than for her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I saw a great cruel bird chasing a harmless duck!' she exclaimed
      innocently. 'And I ran after to see what the end of it would be-much
      further than I had any idea of going. However, the duck came to a pond,
      and in running round it to see the end of the fight, I could not remember
      which way I had come.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mercy!' said her mother-in-law, lifting her large eyelids, heavy as
      window-shutters, and spreading out her fingers like the horns of a snail.
      'You might have sunk up to your knees and got lost in that swampy
      place-such a time of night, too. What a tomboy you are! And how did you
      find your way home after all!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, some man showed me the way, and then I had no difficulty, and after
      that I came along leisurely.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I thought you had been running all the way; you look so warm.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is a warm evening. . . . Yes, and I have been thinking of old times as
      I walked along,' she said, 'and how people's positions in life alter. Have
      I not heard you say that while I was at Bonn, at school, some family that
      we had known had their household broken up when the father died, and that
      the children went away you didn't know where?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you mean the Julians?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, that was the name.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, of course you know it was the Julians. Young Julian had a day or
      two's fancy for you one summer, had he not?-just after you came to us, at
      the same time, or just before it, that my poor boy and you were so
      desperately attached to each other.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O yes, I recollect,' said Ethelberta. 'And he had a sister, I think. I
      wonder where they went to live after the family collapse.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I do not know,' said Lady Petherwin, taking up another sheet of paper. 'I
      have a dim notion that the son, who had been brought up to no profession,
      became a teacher of music in some country town-music having always been
      his hobby. But the facts are not very distinct in my memory.' And she
      dipped her pen for another letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta, with a rather fallen countenance, then left her mother-in-law,
      and went where all ladies are supposed to go when they want to torment
      their minds in comfort-to her own room. Here she thoughtfully sat down
      awhile, and some time later she rang for her maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Menlove,' she said, without looking towards a rustle and half a footstep
      that had just come in at the door, but leaning back in her chair and
      speaking towards the corner of the looking-glass, 'will you go down and
      find out if any gentleman named Julian has been staying in this house? Get
      to know it, I mean, Menlove, not by directly inquiring; you have ways of
      getting to know things, have you not? If the devoted George were here now,
      he would help-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'George was nothing to me, ma'am.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'James, then.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And I only had James for a week or ten days: when I found he was a
      married man, I encouraged his addresses very little indeed.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If you had encouraged him heart and soul, you couldn't have fumed more at
      the loss of him. But please to go and make that inquiry, will you,
      Menlove?'
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes Ethelberta's woman was back again. 'A gentleman of that
      name stayed here last night, and left this afternoon.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Will you find out his address?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the lady's-maid had already been quick-witted enough to find out that,
      and indeed all about him; but it chanced that a fashionable illustrated
      weekly paper had just been sent from the bookseller's, and being in want
      of a little time to look it over before it reached her mistress's hands,
      Mrs. Menlove retired, as if to go and ask the question-to stand meanwhile
      under the gas-lamp in the passage, inspecting the fascinating engravings.
      But as time will not wait for tire-women, a natural length of absence soon
      elapsed, and she returned again and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      'His address is, Upper Street, Sandbourne.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Thank you, that will do,' replied her mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hour grew later, and that dreamy period came round when ladies'
      fancies, that have lain shut up close as their fans during the day, begin
      to assert themselves anew. At this time a good guess at Ethelberta's
      thoughts might have been made from her manner of passing the minutes away.
      Instead of reading, entering notes in her diary, or doing any ordinary
      thing, she walked to and fro, curled her pretty nether lip within her
      pretty upper one a great many times, made a cradle of her locked fingers,
      and paused with fixed eyes where the walls of the room set limits upon her
      walk to look at nothing but a picture within her mind.

    <h2>
      2. CHRISTOPHER'S HOUSE-SANDBOURNE TOWN-SANDBOURNE MOOR
    </h2>
    <p>
      During the wet autumn of the same year, the postman passed one morning as
      usual into a plain street that ran through the less fashionable portion of
      Sandbourne, a modern coast town and watering-place not many miles from the
      ancient Anglebury. He knocked at the door of a flat-faced brick house, and
      it was opened by a slight, thoughtful young man, with his hat on, just
      then coming out. The postman put into his hands a book packet, addressed,
      'Christopher Julian, Esq.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher took the package upstairs, opened it with curiosity, and
      discovered within a green volume of poems, by an anonymous writer, the
      title-page bearing the inscription, 'Metres by E.' The book was new,
      though it was cut, and it appeared to have been looked into. The young
      man, after turning it over and wondering where it came from, laid it on
      the table and went his way, being in haste to fulfil his engagements for
      the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening, on returning home from his occupations, he sat himself
      down cosily to read the newly-arrived volume. The winds of this uncertain
      season were snarling in the chimneys, and drops of rain spat themselves
      into the fire, revealing plainly that the young man's room was not far
      enough from the top of the house to admit of a twist in the flue, and
      revealing darkly a little more, if that social rule-of-three inverse, the
      higher in lodgings the lower in pocket, were applicable here. However, the
      aspect of the room, though homely, was cheerful, a somewhat contradictory
      group of furniture suggesting that the collection consisted of waifs and
      strays from a former home, the grimy faces of the old articles exercising
      a curious and subduing effect on the bright faces of the new. An oval
      mirror of rococo workmanship, and a heavy cabinet-piano with a cornice
      like that of an Egyptian temple, adjoined a harmonium of yesterday, and a
      harp that was almost as new. Printed music of the last century, and
      manuscript music of the previous evening, lay there in such quantity as to
      endanger the tidiness of a retreat which was indeed only saved from a
      chronic state of litter by a pair of hands that sometimes played, with the
      lightness of breezes, about the sewing-machine standing in a remote
      corner-if any corner could be called remote in a room so small.

    <p>
      Fire lights and shades from the shaking flames struck in a butterfly
      flutter on the underparts of the mantelshelf, and upon the reader's cheek
      as he sat. Presently, and all at once, a much greater intentness pervaded
      his face: he turned back again, and read anew the subject that had
      arrested his eyes. He was a man whose countenance varied with his mood,
      though it kept somewhat in the rear of that mood. He looked sad when he
      felt almost serene, and only serene when he felt quite cheerful. It is a
      habit people acquire who have had repressing experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      A faint smile and flush now lightened his face, and jumping up he opened
      the door and exclaimed, 'Faith! will you come here for a moment?'
    </p>
    <p>
      A prompt step was heard on the stairs, and the young person addressed as
      Faith entered the room. She was small in figure, and bore less in the form
      of her features than in their shades when changing from expression to
      expression the evidence that she was his sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Faith-I want your opinion. But, stop, read this first.' He laid his
      finger upon a page in the book, and placed it in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl drew from her pocket a little green-leather sheath, worn at the
      edges to whity-brown, and out of that a pair of spectacles, unconsciously
      looking round the room for a moment as she did so, as if to ensure that no
      stranger saw her in the act of using them. Here a weakness was uncovered
      at once; it was a small, pretty, and natural one; indeed, as weaknesses go
      in the great world, it might almost have been called a commendable trait.
      She then began to read, without sitting down.
    </p>
    <p>
      These 'Metres by E.' composed a collection of soft and marvellously
      musical rhymes, of a nature known as the vers de societe. The lines
      presented a series of playful defences of the supposed strategy of
      womankind in fascination, courtship, and marriage-the whole teeming with
      ideas bright as mirrors and just as unsubstantial, yet forming a brilliant
      argument to justify the ways of girls to men. The pervading characteristic
      of the mass was the means of forcing into notice, by strangeness of
      contrast, the single mournful poem that the book contained. It was placed
      at the very end, and under the title of 'Cancelled Words,' formed a
      whimsical and rather affecting love-lament, somewhat in the tone of many
      of Sir Thomas Wyatt's poems. This was the piece which had arrested
      Christopher's attention, and had been pointed out by him to his sister
      Faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is very touching,' she said, looking up.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What do you think I suspect about it-that the poem is addressed to me! Do
      you remember, when father was alive and we were at Solentsea that season,
      about a governess who came there with a Sir Ralph Petherwin and his wife,
      people with a sickly little daughter and a grown-up son?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I never saw any of them. I think I remember your knowing something about
      a young man of that name.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, that was the family. Well, the governess there was a very attractive
      woman, and somehow or other I got more interested in her than I ought to
      have done (this is necessary to the history), and we used to meet in
      romantic places-and-and that kind of thing, you know. The end of it was,
      she jilted me and married the son.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You were anxious to get away from Solentsea.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Was I? Then that was chiefly the reason. Well, I decided to think no more
      of her, and I was helped to do it by the troubles that came upon us
      shortly afterwards; it is a blessed arrangement that one does not feel a
      sentimental grief at all when additional grief comes in the shape of
      practical misfortune. However, on the first afternoon of the little
      holiday I took for my walking tour last summer, I came to Anglebury, and
      stayed about the neighbourhood for a day or two to see what it was like,
      thinking we might settle there if this place failed us. The next evening I
      left, and walked across the heath to Flychett-that's a village about five
      miles further on-so as to be that distance on my way for next morning; and
      while I was crossing the heath there I met this very woman. We talked a
      little, because we couldn't help it-you may imagine the kind of talk it
      was-and parted as coolly as we had met. Now this strange book comes to me;
      and I have a strong conviction that she is the writer of it, for that poem
      sketches a similar scene-or rather suggests it; and the tone generally
      seems the kind of thing she would write-not that she was a sad woman,
      either.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She seems to be a warm-hearted, impulsive woman, to judge from these
      tender verses.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'People who print very warm words have sometimes very cold manners. I
      wonder if it is really her writing, and if she has sent it to me!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Would it not be a singular thing for a married woman to do? Though of
      course'-(she removed her spectacles as if they hindered her from thinking,
      and hid them under the timepiece till she should go on reading)-'of course
      poets have morals and manners of their own, and custom is no argument with
      them. I am sure I would not have sent it to a man for the world!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I do not see any absolute harm in her sending it. Perhaps she thinks
      that, since it is all over, we may as well die friends.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If I were her husband I should have doubts about the dying. And "all
      over" may not be so plain to other people as it is to you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Perhaps not. And when a man checks all a woman's finer sentiments towards
      him by marrying her, it is only natural that it should find a vent
      somewhere. However, she probably does not know of my downfall since
      father's death. I hardly think she would have cared to do it had she known
      that. (I am assuming that it is Ethelberta-Mrs. Petherwin-who sends it: of
      course I am not sure.) We must remember that when I knew her I was a
      gentleman at ease, who had not the least notion that I should have to work
      for a living, and not only so, but should have first to invent a
      profession to work at out of my old tastes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Kit, you have made two mistakes in your thoughts of that lady. Even
      though I don't know her, I can show you that. Now I'll tell you! the first
      is in thinking that a married lady would send the book with that poem in
      it without at any rate a slight doubt as to its propriety: the second is
      in supposing that, had she wished to do it, she would have given the thing
      up because of our misfortunes. With a true woman the second reason would
      have had no effect had she once got over the first. I'm a woman, and
      that's why I know.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher said nothing, and turned over the poems.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      He lived by teaching music, and, in comparison with starving, thrived;
      though the wealthy might possibly have said that in comparison with
      thriving he starved. During this night he hummed airs in bed, thought he
      would do for the ballad of the fair poetess what other musicians had done
      for the ballads of other fair poetesses, and dreamed that she smiled on
      him as her prototype Sappho smiled on Phaon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning before starting on his rounds a new circumstance induced
      him to direct his steps to the bookseller's, and ask a question. He had
      found on examining the wrapper of the volume that it was posted in his own
      town.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No copy of the book has been sold by me,' the bookseller's voice replied
      from far up the Alpine height of the shop-ladder, where he stood dusting
      stale volumes, as was his habit of a morning before customers came. 'I
      have never heard of it-probably never shall;' and he shook out the duster,
      so as to hit the delicate mean between stifling Christopher and not
      stifling him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Surely you don't live by your shop?' said Christopher, drawing back.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bookseller's eyes rested on the speaker's; his face changed; he came
      down and placed his hand on the lapel of Christopher's coat. 'Sir,' he
      said, 'country bookselling is a miserable, impoverishing, exasperating
      thing in these days. Can you understand the rest?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I can; I forgive a starving man anything,' said Christopher.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You go a long way very suddenly,' said the book seller. 'Half as much
      pity would have seemed better. However, wait a moment.' He looked into a
      list of new books, and added: 'The work you allude to was only published
      last week; though, mind you, if it had been published last century I might
      not have sold a copy.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Although his time was precious, Christopher had now become so interested
      in the circumstance that the unseen sender was somebody breathing his own
      atmosphere, possibly the very writer herself-the book being too new to be
      known-that he again passed through the blue shadow of the spire which
      stretched across the street to-day, and went towards the post-office,
      animated by a bright intention-to ask the postmaster if he knew the
      handwriting in which the packet was addressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the postmaster was an acquaintance of Christopher's, but, as regarded
      putting that question to him, there was a difficulty. Everything turned
      upon whether the postmaster at the moment of asking would be in his
      under-government manner, or in the manner with which mere nature had
      endowed him. In the latter case his reply would be all that could be
      wished; in the former, a man who had sunk in society might as well put his
      tongue into a mousetrap as make an inquiry so obviously outside the pale
      of legality as was this.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he postponed his business for the present, and refrained from entering
      till he passed by after dinner, when pleasant malt liquor, of that
      capacity for cheering which is expressed by four large letter X's marching
      in a row, had refilled the globular trunk of the postmaster and
      neutralized some of the effects of officiality. The time was well chosen,
      but the inquiry threatened to prove fruitless: the postmaster had never,
      to his knowledge, seen the writing before. Christopher was turning away
      when a clerk in the background looked up and stated that some young lady
      had brought a packet with such an address upon it into the office two days
      earlier to get it stamped.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you know her?' said Christopher.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have seen her about the neighbourhood. She goes by every morning; I
      think she comes into the town from beyond the common, and returns again
      between four and five in the afternoon.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What does she wear?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A white wool jacket with zigzags of black braid.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher left the post-office and went his way. Among his other pupils
      there were two who lived at some distance from Sandbourne-one of them in
      the direction indicated as that habitually taken by the young person; and
      in the afternoon, as he returned homeward, Christopher loitered and looked
      around. At first he could see nobody; but when about a mile from the
      outskirts of the town he discerned a light spot ahead of him, which
      actually turned out to be the jacket alluded to. In due time he met the
      wearer face to face; she was not Ethelberta Petherwin-quite a different
      sort of individual. He had long made up his mind that this would be the
      case, yet he was in some indescribable way disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the two classes into which gentle young women naturally divide, those
      who grow red at their weddings, and those who grow pale, the present one
      belonged to the former class. She was an April-natured, pink-cheeked girl,
      with eyes that would have made any jeweller in England think of his
      trade-one who evidently took her day in the daytime, frequently caught the
      early worm, and had little to do with yawns or candlelight. She came and
      passed him; he fancied that her countenance changed. But one may fancy
      anything, and the pair receded each from each without turning their heads.
      He could not speak to her, plain and simple as she seemed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is rarely that a man who can be entered and made to throb by the
      channel of his ears is not open to a similar attack through the channel of
      his eyes-for many doors will admit to one mansion-allowance being made for
      the readier capacity of chosen and practised organs. Hence the beauties,
      concords, and eloquences of the female form were never without their
      effect upon Christopher, a born musician, artist, poet, seer,
      mouthpiece-whichever a translator of Nature's oracles into simple speech
      may be called. The young girl who had gone by was fresh and pleasant;
      moreover, she was a sort of mysterious HANDlink between himself and the
      past, which these things were vividly reviving in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following week Christopher met her again. She had not much dignity, he
      had not much reserve, and the sudden resolution to have a holiday which
      sometimes impels a plump heart to rise up against a brain that overweights
      it was not to be resisted. He just lifted his hat, and put the only
      question he could think of as a beginning: 'Have I the pleasure of
      addressing the author of a book of very melodious poems that was sent me
      the other day?'
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl's forefinger twirled rapidly the loop of braid that it had
      previously been twirling slowly, and drawing in her breath, she said, 'No,
      sir.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The sender, then?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She somehow presented herself as so insignificant by the combined effect
      of the manner and the words that Christopher lowered his method of address
      to her level at once. 'Ah,' he said, 'such an atmosphere as the writer of
      "Metres by E." seems to breathe would soon spoil cheeks that are fresh and
      round as lady-apples-eh, little girl? But are you disposed to tell me that
      writer's name?'
    </p>
    <p>
      By applying a general idea to a particular case a person with the best of
      intentions may find himself immediately landed in a quandary. In saying to
      the country girl before him what would have suited the mass of country
      lasses well enough, Christopher had offended her beyond the cure of
      compliment.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am not disposed to tell the writer's name,' she replied, with a dudgeon
      that was very great for one whose whole stock of it was a trifle. And she
      passed on and left him standing alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus further conversation was checked; but, through having rearranged the
      hours of his country lessons, Christopher met her the next Wednesday, and
      the next Friday, and throughout the following week-no further words
      passing between them. For a while she went by very demurely, apparently
      mindful of his offence. But effrontery is not proved to be part of a man's
      nature till he has been guilty of a second act: the best of men may commit
      a first through accident or ignorance-may even be betrayed into it by
      over-zeal for experiment. Some such conclusion may or may not have been
      arrived at by the girl with the lady-apple cheeks; at any rate, after the
      lapse of another week a new spectacle presented itself; her redness
      deepened whenever Christopher passed her by, and embarrassment pervaded
      her from the lowest stitch to the tip of her feather. She had little
      chance of escaping him by diverging from the road, for a figure could be
      seen across the open ground to the distance of half a mile on either side.
      One day as he drew near as usual, she met him as women meet a cloud of
      dust-she turned and looked backwards till he had passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      This would have been disconcerting but for one reason: Christopher was
      ceasing to notice her. He was a man who often, when walking abroad, and
      looking as it were at the scene before his eyes, discerned successes and
      failures, friends and relations, episodes of childhood, wedding feasts and
      funerals, the landscape suffering greatly by these visions, until it
      became no more than the patterned wall-tints about the paintings in a
      gallery; something necessary to the tone, yet not regarded. Nothing but a
      special concentration of himself on externals could interrupt this habit,
      and now that her appearance along the way had changed from a chance to a
      custom he began to lapse again into the old trick. He gazed once or twice
      at her form without seeing it: he did not notice that she trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sometimes read as he walked, and book in hand he frequently approached
      her now. This went on till six weeks had passed from the time of their
      first encounter. Latterly might have been once or twice heard, when he had
      moved out of earshot, a sound like a small gasping sigh; but no
      arrangements were disturbed, and Christopher continued to keep down his
      eyes as persistently as a saint in a church window.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last day of his engagement had arrived, and with it the last of his
      walks that way. On his final return he carried in his hand a bunch of
      flowers which had been presented to him at the country-house where his
      lessons were given. He was taking them home to his sister Faith, who
      prized the lingering blossoms of the seeding season. Soon appeared as
      usual his fellow-traveller; whereupon Christopher looked down upon his
      nosegay. 'Sweet simple girl,' he thought, 'I'll endeavour to make peace
      with her by means of these flowers before we part for good.'
    </p>
    <p>
      When she came up he held them out to her and said, 'Will you allow me to
      present you with these?'
    </p>
    <p>
      The bright colours of the nosegay instantly attracted the girl's
      hand-perhaps before there had been time for thought to thoroughly construe
      the position; for it happened that when her arm was stretched into the air
      she steadied it quickly, and stood with the pose of a statue-rigid with
      uncertainty. But it was too late to refuse: Christopher had put the
      nosegay within her fingers. Whatever pleasant expression of thanks may
      have appeared in her eyes fell only on the bunch of flowers, for during
      the whole transaction they reached to no higher level than that. To say
      that he was coming no more seemed scarcely necessary under the
      circumstances, and wishing her 'Good afternoon' very heartily, he passed
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had learnt by this time her occupation, which was that of pupil-teacher
      at one of the schools in the town, whither she walked daily from a village
      near. If he had not been poor and the little teacher humble, Christopher
      might possibly have been tempted to inquire more briskly about her, and
      who knows how such a pursuit might have ended? But hard externals rule
      volatile sentiment, and under these untoward influences the girl and the
      book and the truth about its author were matters upon which he could not
      afford to expend much time. All Christopher did was to think now and then
      of the pretty innocent face and round deep eyes, not once wondering if the
      mind which enlivened them ever thought of him.

    <h2>
      3. SANDBOURNE MOOR (continued)
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was one of those hostile days of the year when chatterbox ladies remain
      miserably in their homes to save the carriage and harness, when clerks'
      wives hate living in lodgings, when vehicles and people appear in the
      street with duplicates of themselves underfoot, when bricklayers, slaters,
      and other out-door journeymen sit in a shed and drink beer, when ducks and
      drakes play with hilarious delight at their own family game, or spread out
      one wing after another in the slower enjoyment of letting the delicious
      moisture penetrate to their innermost down. The smoke from the flues of
      Sandbourne had barely strength enough to emerge into the drizzling rain,
      and hung down the sides of each chimney-pot like the streamer of a
      becalmed ship; and a troop of rats might have rattled down the pipes from
      roof to basement with less noise than did the water that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the broad moor beyond the town, where Christopher's meetings with the
      teacher had so regularly occurred, were a stream and some large pools; and
      beside one of these, near some hatches and a weir, stood a little square
      building, not much larger inside than the Lord Mayor's coach. It was known
      simply as 'The Weir House.' On this wet afternoon, which was the one
      following the day of Christopher's last lesson over the plain, a nearly
      invisible smoke came from the puny chimney of the hut. Though the door was
      closed, sounds of chatting and mirth fizzed from the interior, and would
      have told anybody who had come near-which nobody did-that the usually
      empty shell was tenanted to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scene within was a large fire in a fireplace to which the whole floor
      of the house was no more than a hearthstone. The occupants were two
      gentlemanly persons, in shooting costume, who had been traversing the moor
      for miles in search of wild duck and teal, a waterman, and a small
      spaniel. In the corner stood their guns, and two or three wild mallards,
      which represented the scanty product of their morning's labour, the
      iridescent necks of the dead birds replying to every flicker of the fire.
      The two sportsmen were smoking, and their man was mostly occupying himself
      in poking and stirring the fire with a stick: all three appeared to be
      pretty well wetted.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the gentlemen, by way of varying the not very exhilarating study of
      four brick walls within microscopic distance of his eye, turned to a small
      square hole which admitted light and air to the hut, and looked out upon
      the dreary prospect before him. The wide concave of cloud, of the
      monotonous hue of dull pewter, formed an unbroken hood over the level from
      horizon to horizon; beneath it, reflecting its wan lustre, was the glazed
      high-road which stretched, hedgeless and ditchless, past a directing-post
      where another road joined it, and on to the less regular ground beyond,
      lying like a riband unrolled across the scene, till it vanished over the
      furthermost undulation. Beside the pools were occasional tall sheaves of
      flags and sedge, and about the plain a few bushes, these forming the only
      obstructions to a view otherwise unbroken.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sportsman's attention was attracted by a figure in a state of gradual
      enlargement as it approached along the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I should think that if pleasure can't tempt a native out of doors to-day,
      business will never force him out,' he observed. 'There is, for the first
      time, somebody coming along the road.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If business don't drag him out pleasure'll never tempt en, is more like
      our nater in these parts, sir,' said the man, who was looking into the
      fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation showed no vitality, and down it dropped dead as before,
      the man who was standing up continuing to gaze into the moisture. What had
      at first appeared as an epicene shape the decreasing space resolved into a
      cloaked female under an umbrella: she now relaxed her pace, till, reaching
      the directing-post where the road branched into two, she paused and looked
      about her. Instead of coming further she slowly retraced her steps for
      about a hundred yards.
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's an appointment,' said the first speaker, as he removed the cigar
      from his lips; 'and by the lords, what a day and place for an appointment
      with a woman!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What's an appointment?' inquired his friend, a town young man, with a
      Tussaud complexion and well-pencilled brows half way up his forehead, so
      that his upper eyelids appeared to possess the uncommon quality of
      tallness.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Look out here, and you'll see. By that directing-post, where the two
      roads meet. As a man devoted to art, Ladywell, who has had the honour of
      being hung higher up on the Academy walls than any other living painter,
      you should take out your sketch-book and dash off the scene.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Where nothing particular is going on, one incident makes a drama; and,
      interested in that proportion, the art-sportsman puts up his eyeglass (a
      form he adhered to before firing at game that had risen, by which merciful
      arrangement the bird got safe off), placed his face beside his
      companion's, and also peered through the opening. The young
      pupil-teacher-for she was the object of their scrutiny-re-approached the
      spot whereon she had been accustomed for the last many weeks of her
      journey home to meet Christopher, now for the first time missing, and
      again she seemed reluctant to pass the hand-post, for that marked the
      point where the chance of seeing him ended. She glided backwards as
      before, this time keeping her face still to the front, as if trying to
      persuade the world at large, and her own shamefacedness, that she had not
      yet approached the place at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Query, how long will she wait for him (for it is a man to a certainty)?'
      resumed the elder of the smokers, at the end of several minutes of
      silence, when, full of vacillation and doubt, she became lost to view
      behind some bushes. 'Will she reappear?' The smoking went on, and up she
      came into open ground as before, and walked by.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I wonder who the girl is, to come to such a place in this weather? There
      she is again,' said the young man called Ladywell.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Some cottage lass, not yet old enough to make the most of the value set
      on her by her follower, small as that appears to be. Now we may get an
      idea of the hour named by the fellow for the appointment, for, depend upon
      it, the time when she first came-about five minutes ago-was the time he
      should have been there. It is now getting on towards five-half-past four
      was doubtless the time mentioned.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She's not come o' purpose: 'tis her way home from school every day,' said
      the waterman.
    </p>
    <p>
      'An experiment on woman's endurance and patience under neglect. Two to one
      against her staying a quarter of an hour.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The same odds against her not staying till five would be nearer
      probability. What's half-an-hour to a girl in love?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'On a moorland in wet weather it is thirty perceptible minutes to any
      fireside man, woman, or beast in Christendom-minutes that can be felt,
      like the Egyptian plague of darkness. Now, little girl, go home: he is not
      worth it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Twenty minutes passed, and the girl returned miserably to the hand-post,
      still to wander back to her retreat behind the sedge, and lead any chance
      comer from the opposite quarter to believe that she had not yet reached
      this ultimate point beyond which a meeting with Christopher was
      impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now you'll find that she means to wait the complete half-hour, and then
      off she goes with a broken heart.'
    </p>
    <p>
      All three now looked through the hole to test the truth of the
      prognostication. The hour of five completed itself on their watches; the
      girl again came forward. And then the three in ambuscade could see her
      pull out her handkerchief and place it to her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      'She's grieving now because he has not come. Poor little woman, what a
      brute he must be; for a broken heart in a woman means a broken vow in a
      man, as I infer from a thousand instances in experience, romance, and
      history. Don't open the door till she is gone, Ladywell; it will only
      disturb her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      As they had guessed, the pupil-teacher, hearing the distant town-clock
      strike the hour, gave way to her fancy no longer, and launched into the
      diverging path. This lingering for Christopher's arrival had, as is known,
      been founded on nothing more of the nature of an assignation than lay in
      his regular walk along the plain at that time every Monday, Wednesday, and
      Friday of the six previous weeks. It must be said that he was very far
      indeed from divining that his injudicious peace-offering of the flowers
      had stirred into life such a wearing, anxious, hopeful, despairing
      solicitude as this, which had been latent for some time during his
      constant meetings with the little stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      She vanished in the mist towards the left, and the loiterers in the hut
      began to move and open the door, remarking, 'Now then for Wyndway House, a
      change of clothes, and a dinner.'

    <h2>
      4. SANDBOURNE PIER-ROAD TO WYNDWAY-BALL-ROOM IN WYNDWAY HOUSE
    </h2>
    <p>
      The last light of a winter day had gone down behind the houses of
      Sandbourne, and night was shut close over all. Christopher, about eight
      o'clock, was standing at the end of the pier with his back towards the
      open sea, whence the waves were pushing to the shore in frills and coils
      that were just rendered visible in all their bleak instability by the row
      of lights along the sides of the jetty, the rapid motion landward of the
      wavetips producing upon his eye an apparent progress of the pier out to
      sea. This pier-head was a spot which Christopher enjoyed visiting on such
      moaning and sighing nights as the present, when the sportive and
      variegated throng that haunted the pier on autumn days was no longer
      there, and he seemed alone with weather and the invincible sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somebody came towards him along the deserted footway, and rays from the
      nearest lamp streaked the face of his sister Faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O Christopher, I knew you were here,' she said eagerly. 'You are wanted;
      there's a servant come from Wyndway House for you. He is sent to ask if
      you can come immediately to play at a little dance they have resolved upon
      this evening-quite suddenly it seems. If you can come, you must bring with
      you any assistant you can lay your hands upon at a moment's notice, he
      says.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Wyndway House; why should the people send for me above all other
      musicians in the town?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Faith did not know. 'If you really decide to go,' she said, as they walked
      homeward, 'you might take me as your assistant. I should answer the
      purpose, should I not, Kit? since it is only a dance or two they seem to
      want.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And your harp I suppose you mean. Yes; you might be competent to take a
      part. It cannot be a regular ball; they would have had the quadrille band
      for anything of that sort. Faith-we'll go. However, let us see the man
      first, and inquire particulars.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Reaching home, Christopher found at his door a horse and wagonette in
      charge of a man-servant in livery, who repeated what Faith had told her
      brother. Wyndway House was a well-known country-seat three or four miles
      out of the town, and the coachman mentioned that if they were going it
      would be well that they should get ready to start as soon as they
      conveniently could, since he had been told to return by ten if possible.
      Christopher quickly prepared himself, and put a new string or two into
      Faith's harp, by which time she also was dressed; and, wrapping up herself
      and her instrument safe from the night air, away they drove at half-past
      nine.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is it a large party?' said Christopher, as they whizzed along.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, sir; it is what we call a dance-that is, 'tis like a ball, you know,
      on a small scale-a ball on a spurt, that you never thought of till you had
      it. In short, it grew out of a talk at dinner, I believe; and some of the
      young people present wanted a jig, and didn't care to play themselves, you
      know, young ladies being an idle class of society at the best of times.
      We've a house full of sleeping company, you understand-been there a week
      some of 'em-most of 'em being mistress's relations.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'They probably found it a little dull.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, yes-it is rather dull for 'em-Christmas-time and all. As soon as it
      was proposed they were wild for sending post-haste for somebody or other
      to play to them.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Did they name me particularly?' said Christopher.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes; "Mr. Christopher Julian," she says. "The gent who's turned
      music-man?" I said. "Yes, that's him," says she.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'There were music-men living nearer to your end of the town than I.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, but I know it was you particular: though I don't think mistress
      thought anything about you at first. Mr. Joyce-that's the butler-said that
      your name was mentioned to our old party, when he was in the room, by a
      young lady staying with us, and mistress says then, "The Julians have had
      a downfall, and the son has taken to music." Then when dancing was talked
      of, they said, "O, let's have him by all means."'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Was the young lady who first inquired for my family the same one who
      said, "Let's have him by all means?"'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no; but it was on account of her asking that the rest said they would
      like you to play-at least that's as I had it from Joyce.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you know that lady's name?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mrs. Petherwin.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Cold, sir?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher did not like to question the man any further, though what he
      had heard added new life to his previous curiosity; and they drove along
      the way in silence, Faith's figure, wrapped up to the top of her head,
      cutting into the sky behind them like a sugar-loaf. Such gates as crossed
      the roads had been left open by the forethought of the coachman, and,
      passing the lodge, they proceeded about half-a-mile along a private drive,
      then ascended a rise, and came in view of the front of the mansion,
      punctured with windows that were now mostly lighted up.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What is that?' said Faith, catching a glimpse of something that the
      carriage-lamp showed on the face of one wall as they passed, a marble
      bas-relief of some battle-piece, built into the stonework.
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's the scene of the death of one of the squire's forefathers-Colonel
      Sir Martin Jones, who was killed at the moment of victory in the battle of
      Salamanca-but I haven't been here long enough to know the rights of it.
      When I am in one of my meditations, as I wait here with the carriage
      sometimes, I think how many more get killed at the moment of victory than
      at the moment of defeat. This is the entrance for you, sir.' And he turned
      the corner and pulled up before a side door.
    </p>
    <p>
      They alighted and went in, Christopher shouldering Faith's harp, and she
      marching modestly behind, with curly-eared music-books under her arm. They
      were shown into the house-steward's room, and ushered thence along a
      badly-lit passage and past a door within which a hum and laughter were
      audible. The door next to this was then opened for them, and they entered.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Scarcely had Faith, or Christopher either, ever beheld a more shining
      scene than was presented by the saloon in which they now found themselves.
      Coming direct from the gloomy park, and led to the room by that back
      passage from the servants' quarter, the light from the chandelier and
      branches against the walls, striking on gilding at all points, quite
      dazzled their sight for a minute or two; it caused Faith to move forward
      with her eyes on the floor, and filled Christopher with an impulse to turn
      back again into some dusky corner where every thread of his not over-new
      dress suit-rather moth-eaten through lack of feasts for airing it-could be
      counted less easily.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was soon seated before a grand piano, and Faith sat down under the
      shadow of her harp, both being arranged on a dais within an alcove at one
      end of the room. A screen of ivy and holly had been constructed across the
      front of this recess for the games of the children on Christmas Eve, and
      it still remained there, a small creep-hole being left for entrance and
      exit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the merry guests tumbled through doors at the further end, and
      dancing began. The mingling of black-coated men and bright ladies gave a
      charming appearance to the groups as seen by Faith and her brother, the
      whole spectacle deriving an unexpected novelty from the accident of
      reaching their eyes through interstices in the tracery of green leaves,
      which added to the picture a softness that it would not otherwise have
      possessed. On the other hand, the musicians, having a much weaker light,
      could hardly be discerned by the performers in the dance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The music was now rattling on, and the ladies in their foam-like dresses
      were busily threading and spinning about the floor, when Faith, casually
      looking up into her brother's face, was surprised to see that a change had
      come over it. At the end of the quadrille he leant across to her before
      she had time to speak, and said quietly, 'She's here!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who?' said Faith, for she had not heard the words of the coachman.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ethelberta.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Which is she?' asked Faith, peeping through with the keenest interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The one who has the skirts of her dress looped up with convolvulus
      flowers-the one with her hair fastened in a sort of Venus knot behind; she
      has just been dancing with that perfumed piece of a man they call Mr.
      Ladywell-it is he with the high eyebrows arched like a girl's.' He added,
      with a wrinkled smile, 'I cannot for my life see anybody answering to the
      character of husband to her, for every man takes notice of her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      They were interrupted by another dance being called for, and then, his
      fingers tapping about upon the keys as mechanically as fowls pecking at
      barleycorns, Christopher gave himself up with a curious and far from
      unalloyed pleasure to the occupation of watching Ethelberta, now again
      crossing the field of his vision like a returned comet whose
      characteristics were becoming purely historical. She was a plump-armed
      creature, with a white round neck as firm as a fort-altogether a vigorous
      shape, as refreshing to the eye as the green leaves through which he
      beheld her. She danced freely, and with a zest that was apparently
      irrespective of partners. He had been waiting long to hear her speak, and
      when at length her voice did reach his ears, it was the revelation of a
      strange matter to find how great a thing that small event had become to
      him. He knew the old utterance-rapid but not frequent, an obstructive
      thought causing sometimes a sudden halt in the midst of a stream of words.
      But the features by which a cool observer would have singled her out from
      others in his memory when asking himself what she was like, was a peculiar
      gaze into imaginary far-away distance when making a quiet remark to a
      partner-not with contracted eyes like a seafaring man, but with an open
      full look-a remark in which little words in a low tone were made to
      express a great deal, as several single gentlemen afterwards found.
    </p>
    <p>
      The production of dance-music when the criticizing stage among the dancers
      has passed, and they have grown full of excitement and animal spirits,
      does not require much concentration of thought in the producers thereof;
      and desultory conversation accordingly went on between Faith and her
      brother from time to time.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Kit,' she said on one occasion, 'are you looking at the way in which the
      flowers are fastened to the leaves?-taking a mean advantage of being at
      the back of the tapestry? You cannot think how you stare at them.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I was looking through them-certainly not at them. I have a feeling of
      being moved about like a puppet in the hands of a person who legally can
      be nothing to me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That charming woman with the shining bunch of hair and convolvuluses?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes: it is through her that we are brought here, and through her writing
      that poem, "Cancelled Words," that the book was sent me, and through the
      accidental renewal of acquaintance between us on Anglebury Heath, that she
      wrote the poem. I was, however, at the moment you spoke, thinking more
      particularly of the little teacher whom Ethelberta must have commissioned
      to send the book to me; and why that girl was chosen to do it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'There may be a hundred reasons. Kit, I have never yet seen her look once
      this way.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher had certainly not yet received look or gesture from her; but
      his time came. It was while he was for a moment outside the recess, and he
      caught her in the act. She became slightly confused, turned aside, and
      entered into conversation with a neighbour.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only a look, and yet what a look it was! One may say of a look that
      it is capable of division into as many species, genera, orders, and
      classes, as the animal world itself. Christopher saw Ethelberta
      Petherwin's performance in this kind-the well-known spark of light upon
      the well-known depths of mystery-and felt something going out of him which
      had gone out of him once before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus continually beholding her and her companions in the giddy whirl, the
      night wore on with the musicians, last dances and more last dances being
      added, till the intentions of the old on the matter were thrice exceeded
      in the interests of the young. Watching the couples whirl and turn,
      advance and recede as gently as spirits, knot themselves like house-flies
      and part again, and lullabied by the faint regular beat of their footsteps
      to the tune, the players sank into the peculiar mesmeric quiet which comes
      over impressionable people who play for a great length of time in the
      midst of such scenes; and at last the only noises that Christopher took
      cognizance of were those of the exceptional kind, breaking above the
      general sea of sound-a casual smart rustle of silk, a laugh, a stumble,
      the monosyllabic talk of those who happened to linger for a moment close
      to the leafy screen-all coming to his ears like voices from those old
      times when he had mingled in similar scenes, not as servant but as guest.

    <h2>
      5. AT THE WINDOW-THE ROAD HOME
    </h2>
    <p>
      The dancing was over at last, and the radiant company had left the room. A
      long and weary night it had been for the two players, though a stimulated
      interest had hindered physical exhaustion in one of them for a while. With
      tingling fingers and aching arms they came out of the alcove into the long
      and deserted apartment, now pervaded by a dry haze. The lights had burnt
      low, and Faith and her brother were waiting by request till the wagonette
      was ready to take them home, a breakfast being in course of preparation
      for them meanwhile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher had crossed the room to relieve his cramped limbs, and now,
      peeping through a crevice in the window curtains, he said suddenly, 'Who's
      for a transformation scene? Faith, look here!'
    </p>
    <p>
      He touched the blind, up it flew, and a gorgeous scene presented itself to
      her eyes. A huge inflamed sun was breasting the horizon of a wide sheet of
      sea which, to her surprise and delight, the mansion overlooked. The
      brilliant disc fired all the waves that lay between it and the shore at
      the bottom of the grounds, where the water tossed the ruddy light from one
      undulation to another in glares as large and clear as mirrors, incessantly
      altering them, destroying them, and creating them again; while further off
      they multiplied, thickened, and ran into one another like struggling
      armies, till they met the fiery source of them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, how wonderful it is!' said Faith, putting her hand on Christopher's
      arm. 'Who knew that whilst we were all shut in here with our puny
      illumination such an exhibition as this was going on outside! How sorry
      and mean the grand and stately room looks now!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher turned his back upon the window, and there were the hitherto
      beaming candle-flames shining no more radiantly than tarnished
      javelin-heads, while the snow-white lengths of wax showed themselves
      clammy and cadaverous as the fingers of a corpse. The leaves and flowers
      which had appeared so very green and blooming by the artificial light were
      now seen to be faded and dusty. Only the gilding of the room in some
      degree brought itself into keeping with the splendours outside, stray
      darts of light seizing upon it and lengthening themselves out along
      fillet, quirk, arris, and moulding, till wasted away.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It seems,' said Faith, 'as if all the people who were lately so merry
      here had died: we ourselves look no more than ghosts.' She turned up her
      weary face to her brother's, which the incoming rays smote aslant, making
      little furrows of every wrinkle thereon, and shady ravines of every little
      furrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are very tired, Faith,' he said. 'Such a heavy night's work has been
      almost too much for you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, I don't mind that,' said Faith. 'But I could not have played so long
      by myself.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'We filled up one another's gaps; and there were plenty of them towards
      the morning; but, luckily, people don't notice those things when the small
      hours draw on.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What troubles me most,' said Faith, 'is not that I have worked, but that
      you should be so situated as to need such miserable assistance as mine. We
      are poor, are we not, Kit?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, we know a little about poverty,' he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      While thus lingering
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    'In shadowy thoroughfares of thought,'
</pre>
    <p>
      Faith interrupted with, 'I believe there is one of the dancers now!-why, I
      should have thought they had all gone to bed, and wouldn't get up again
      for days.' She indicated to him a figure on the lawn towards the left,
      looking upon the same flashing scene as that they themselves beheld.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is your own particular one,' continued Faith. 'Yes, I see the blue
      flowers under the edge of her cloak.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And I see her squirrel-coloured hair,' said Christopher.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both stood looking at this apparition, who once, and only once, thought
      fit to turn her head towards the front of the house they were gazing from.
      Faith was one in whom the meditative somewhat overpowered the active
      faculties; she went on, with no abundance of love, to theorize upon this
      gratuitously charming woman, who, striking freakishly into her brother's
      path, seemed likely to do him no good in her sisterly estimation.
      Ethelberta's bright and shapely form stood before her critic now,
      smartened by the motes of sunlight from head to heel: what Faith would
      have given to see her so clearly within!
    </p>
    <p>
      'Without doubt she is already a lady of many romantic experiences,' she
      said dubiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And on the way to many more,' said Christopher. The tone was just of the
      kind which may be imagined of a sombre man who had been up all night
      piping that others might dance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Faith parted her lips as if in consternation at possibilities. Ethelberta,
      having already become an influence in Christopher's system, might soon
      become more-an indestructible fascination-to drag him about, turn his soul
      inside out, harrow him, twist him, and otherwise torment him, according to
      the stereotyped form of such processes.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were interrupted by the opening of a door. A servant entered and came
      up to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      'This is for you, I believe, sir,' he said. 'Two guineas;' and he placed
      the money in Christopher's hand. 'Some breakfast will be ready for you in
      a moment if you like to have it. Would you wish it brought in here; or
      will you come to the steward's room?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, we will come.' And the man then began to extinguish the lights one
      by one. Christopher dropped the two pounds and two shillings singly into
      his pocket, and looking listlessly at the footman said, 'Can you tell me
      the address of that lady on the lawn? Ah, she has disappeared!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She wore a dress with blue flowers,' said Faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And remarkable bright in her manner? O, that's the young widow,
      Mrs-what's that name-I forget for the moment.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Widow?' said Christopher, the eyes of his understanding getting
      wonderfully clear, and Faith uttering a private ejaculation of thanks that
      after all no commandments were likely to be broken in this matter. 'The
      lady I mean is quite a girlish sort of woman.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, yes, so she is-that's the one. Coachman says she must have been born
      a widow, for there is not time for her ever to have been made one.
      However, she's not quite such a chicken as all that. Mrs. Petherwin,
      that's the party's name.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Does she live here?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, she is staying in the house visiting for a few days with her
      mother-in-law. They are a London family, I don't know her address.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is she a poetess?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That I cannot say. She is very clever at verses; but she don't lean over
      gates to see the sun, and goes to church as regular as you or I, so I
      should hardly be inclined to say that she's the complete thing. When she's
      up in one of her vagaries she'll sit with the ladies and make up pretty
      things out of her head as fast as sticks a-breaking. They will run off her
      tongue like cotton from a reel, and if she can ever be got in the mind of
      telling a story she will bring it out that serious and awful that it makes
      your flesh creep upon your bones; if she's only got to say that she walked
      out of one door into another, she'll tell it so that there seems something
      wonderful in it. 'Tis a bother to start her, so our people say behind her
      back, but, once set going, the house is all alive with her. However, it
      will soon be dull enough; she and Lady Petherwin are off to-morrow for
      Rookington, where I believe they are going to stay over New Year's Day.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Where do you say they are going?' inquired Christopher, as they followed
      the footman.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Rookington Park-about three miles out of Sandbourne, in the opposite
      direction to this.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A widow,' Christopher murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Faith overheard him. 'That makes no difference to us, does it?' she said
      wistfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Forty minutes later they were driving along an open road over a ridge
      which commanded a view of a small inlet below them, the sands of this nook
      being sheltered by crumbling cliffs. Here at once they saw, in the full
      light of the sun, two women standing side by side, their faces directed
      over the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      'There she is again!' said Faith. 'She has walked along the shore from the
      lawn where we saw her before.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' said the coachman, 'she's a curious woman seemingly. She'll talk to
      any poor body she meets. You see she had been out for a morning walk
      instead of going to bed, and that is some queer mortal or other she has
      picked up with on her way.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I wonder she does not prefer some rest,' Faith observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The road then dropped into a hollow, and the women by the sea were no
      longer within view from the carriage, which rapidly neared Sandbourne with
      the two musicians.

    <h2>
      6. THE SHORE BY WYNDWAY
    </h2>
    <p>
      The east gleamed upon Ethelberta's squirrel-coloured hair as she said to
      her companion, 'I have come, Picotee; but not, as you imagine, from a
      night's sleep. We have actually been dancing till daylight at Wyndway.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then you should not have troubled to come! I could have borne the
      disappointment under such circumstances,' said the pupil-teacher, who,
      wearing a dress not so familiar to Christopher's eyes as had been the
      little white jacket, had not been recognized by him from the hill. 'You
      look so tired, Berta. I could not stay up all night for the world!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'One gets used to these things,' said Ethelberta quietly. 'I should have
      been in bed certainly, had I not particularly wished to use this
      opportunity of meeting you before you go home to-morrow. I could not have
      come to Sandbourne to-day, because we are leaving to return again to
      Rookington. This is all that I wish you to take to mother-only a few
      little things which may be useful to her; but you will see what it
      contains when you open it.' She handed to Picotee a small parcel. 'This is
      for yourself,' she went on, giving a small packet besides. 'It will pay
      your fare home and back, and leave you something to spare.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Thank you,' said Picotee docilely.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now, Picotee,' continued the elder, 'let us talk for a few minutes before
      I go back: we may not meet again for some time.' She put her arm round the
      waist of Picotee, who did the same by Ethelberta; and thus interlaced they
      walked backwards and forwards upon the firm flat sand with the motion of
      one body animated by one will.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, what did you think of my poems?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I liked them; but naturally, I did not understand all the experience you
      describe. It is so different from mine. Yet that made them more
      interesting to me. I thought I should so much like to mix in the same
      scenes; but that of course is impossible.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am afraid it is. And you posted the book as I said?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes.' She added hurriedly, as if to change the subject, 'I have told
      nobody that we are sisters, or that you are known in any way to me or to
      mother or to any of us. I thought that would be best, from what you said.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, perhaps it is best for the present.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The box of clothes came safely, and I find very little alteration will be
      necessary to make the dress do beautifully for me on Sundays. It is quite
      new-fashioned to me, though I suppose it was old-fashioned to you. O, and
      Berta, will the title of Lady Petherwin descend to you when your
      mother-in-law dies?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, of course not. She is only a knight's widow, and that's nothing.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The lady of a knight looks as good on paper as the lady of a lord.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. And in other places too sometimes. However, about your journey home.
      Be very careful; and don't make any inquiries at the stations of anybody
      but officials. If any man wants to be friendly with you, try to find out
      if it is from a genuine wish to assist you, or from admiration of your
      fresh face.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How shall I know which?' said Picotee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta laughed. 'If Heaven does not tell you at the moment I cannot,'
      she said. 'But humanity looks with a different eye from love, and upon the
      whole it is most to be prized by all of us. I believe it ends oftener in
      marriage than do a lover's flying smiles. So that for this and other
      reasons love from a stranger is mostly worthless as a speculation; and it
      is certainly dangerous as a game. Well, Picotee, has any one paid you real
      attentions yet?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No-that is-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'There is something going on.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Only a wee bit.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I thought so. There was a dishonesty about your dear eyes which has never
      been there before, and love-making and dishonesty are inseparable as
      coupled hounds. Up comes man, and away goes innocence. Are you going to
      tell me anything about him?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I would rather not, Ethelberta; because it is hardly anything.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, be careful. And mind this, never tell him what you feel.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But then he will never know it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nor must he. He must think it only. The difference between his thinking
      and knowing is often the difference between your winning and losing. But
      general advice is not of much use, and I cannot give more unless you tell
      more. What is his name?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Picotee did not reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never mind: keep your secret. However, listen to this: not a kiss-not so
      much as the shadow, hint, or merest seedling of a kiss!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'There is no fear of it,' murmured Picotee; 'though not because of me!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You see, my dear Picotee, a lover is not a relative; and he isn't quite a
      stranger; but he may end in being either, and the way to reduce him to
      whichever of the two you wish him to be is to treat him like the other.
      Men who come courting are just like bad cooks: if you are kind to them,
      instead of ascribing it to an exceptional courtesy on your part, they
      instantly set it down to their own marvellous worth.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But I ought to favour him just a little, poor thing? Just the smallest
      glimmer of a gleam!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Only a very little indeed-so that it comes as a relief to his misery, not
      as adding to his happiness.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is being too clever, all this; and we ought to be harmless as doves.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, Picotee! to continue harmless as a dove you must be wise as a
      serpent, you'll find-ay, ten serpents, for that matter.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But if I cannot get at him, how can I manage him in these ways you speak
      of?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Get at him? I suppose he gets at you in some way, does he not?-tries to
      see you, or to be near you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No-that's just the point-he doesn't do any such thing, and there's the
      worry of it!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, what a silly girl! Then he is not your lover at all?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Perhaps he's not. But I am his, at any rate-twice over.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's no use. Supply the love for both sides? Why, it's worse than
      furnishing money for both. You don't suppose a man will give his heart in
      exchange for a woman's when he has already got hers for nothing? That's
      not the way old Adam does business at all.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Picotee sighed. 'Have you got a young man, too, Berta?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A young man?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A lover I mean-that's what we call 'em down here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is difficult to explain,' said Ethelberta evasively. 'I knew one many
      years ago, and I have seen him again, and-that is all.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'According to my idea you have one, but according to your own you have
      not; he does not love you, but you love him-is that how it is?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have not quite considered how it is.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you love him?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have never seen a man I hate less.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A great deal lies covered up there, I expect!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He was in that carriage which drove over the hill at the moment we met
      here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah-ah-some great lord or another who has his day by candlelight, and so
      on. I guess the style. Somebody who no more knows how much bread is a loaf
      than I do the price of diamonds and pearls.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am afraid he's only a commoner as yet, and not a very great one either.
      But surely you guess, Picotee? But I'll set you an example of frankness by
      telling his name. My friend, Mr. Julian, to whom you posted the book. Such
      changes as he has seen!-from affluence to poverty. He and his sister have
      been playing dances all night at Wyndway-What is the matter?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Only a pain!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'My dear Picotee-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I think I'll sit down for a moment, Berta.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What-have you over-walked yourself, dear?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes-and I got up very early, you see.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I hope you are not going to be ill, child. You look as if you ought not
      to be here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, it is quite trifling. Does not getting up in a hurry cause a sense of
      faintness sometimes?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, in people who are not strong.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If we don't talk about being faint it will go off. Faintness is such a
      queer thing that to think of it is to have it. Let us talk as we were
      talking before-about your young man and other indifferent matters, so as
      to divert my thoughts from fainting, dear Berta. I have always thought the
      book was to be forwarded to that gentleman because he was a connection of
      yours by marriage, and he had asked for it. And so you have met this-this
      Mr. Julian, and gone for walks with him in evenings, I suppose, just as
      young men and women do who are courting?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, indeed-what an absurd child you are!' said Ethelberta. 'I knew him
      once, and he is interesting; a few little things like that make it all
      up.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The love is all on one side, as with me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no, no: there is nothing like that. I am not attached to any one,
      strictly speaking-though, more strictly speaking, I am not unattached.'
    </p>
    <p>
      ''Tis a delightful middle mind to be in. I know it, for I was like it
      once; but I had scarcely been so long enough to know where I was before I
      was gone past.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You should have commanded yourself, or drawn back entirely; for let me
      tell you that at the beginning of caring for a man-just when you are
      suspended between thinking and feeling-there is a hair's-breadth of time
      at which the question of getting into love or not getting in is a matter
      of will-quite a thing of choice. At the same time, drawing back is a tame
      dance, and the best of all is to stay balanced awhile.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You do that well, I'll warrant.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, no; for what between continually wanting to love, to escape the
      blank lives of those who do not, and wanting not to love, to keep out of
      the miseries of those who do, I get foolishly warm and foolishly cold by
      turns.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes-and I am like you as far as the "foolishly" goes. I wish we poor
      girls could contrive to bring a little wisdom into our love by way of a
      change!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's the very thing that leading minds in town have begun to do, but
      there are difficulties. It is easy to love wisely, but the rich man may
      not marry you; and it is not very hard to reject wisely, but the poor man
      doesn't care. Altogether it is a precious problem. But shall we clamber
      out upon those shining blocks of rock, and find some of the little yellow
      shells that are in the crevices? I have ten minutes longer, and then I
      must go.'

      7. THE DINING-ROOM OF A TOWN HOUSE-THE BUTLER'S PANTRY
    </h2>
    <p>
      A few weeks later there was a friendly dinner-party at the house of a
      gentleman called Doncastle, who lived in a moderately fashionable square
      of west London. All the friends and relatives present were nice people,
      who exhibited becoming signs of pleasure and gaiety at being there; but as
      regards the vigour with which these emotions were expressed, it may be
      stated that a slight laugh from far down the throat and a slight narrowing
      of the eye were equivalent as indices of the degree of mirth felt to a
      Ha-ha-ha! and a shaking of the shoulders among the minor traders of the
      kingdom; and to a Ho-ho-ho! contorted features, purple face, and stamping
      foot among the gentlemen in corduroy and fustian who adorn the remoter
      provinces.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation was chiefly about a volume of musical, tender, and
      humorous rhapsodies lately issued to the world in the guise of verse,
      which had been reviewed and talked about everywhere. This topic, beginning
      as a private dialogue between a young painter named Ladywell and the lady
      on his right hand, had enlarged its ground by degrees, as a subject will
      extend on those rare occasions when it happens to be one about which each
      person has thought something beforehand, instead of, as in the natural
      order of things, one to which the oblivious listener replies mechanically,
      with earnest features, but with thoughts far away. And so the whole table
      made the matter a thing to inquire or reply upon at once, and isolated
      rills of other chat died out like a river in the sands.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Witty things, and occasionally Anacreontic: and they have the originality
      which such a style must naturally possess when carried out by a feminine
      hand,' said Ladywell.
    </p>
    <p>
      'If it is a feminine hand,' said a man near.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ladywell looked as if he sometimes knew secrets, though he did not wish to
      boast.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Written, I presume you mean, in the Anacreontic measure of three feet and
      a half-spondees and iambics?' said a gentleman in spectacles, glancing
      round, and giving emphasis to his inquiry by causing bland glares of a
      circular shape to proceed from his glasses towards the person
      interrogated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The company appeared willing to give consideration to the words of a man
      who knew such things as that, and hung forward to listen. But Ladywell
      stopped the whole current of affairs in that direction by saying-
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no; I was speaking rather of the matter and tone. In fact, the Seven
      Days' Review said they were Anacreontic, you know; and so they are-any one
      may feel they are.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The general look then implied a false encouragement, and the man in
      spectacles looked down again, being a nervous person, who never had time
      to show his merits because he was so much occupied in hiding his faults.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you know the authoress, Mr. Neigh?' continued Ladywell.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Can't say that I do,' he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neigh was a man who never disturbed the flesh upon his face except when he
      was obliged to do so, and paused ten seconds where other people only
      paused one; as he moved his chin in speaking, motes of light from under
      the candle-shade caught, lost, and caught again the outlying threads of
      his burnished beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      'She will be famous some day; and you ought at any rate to read her book.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, I ought, I know. In fact, some years ago I should have done it
      immediately, because I had a reason for pushing on that way just then.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, what was that?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I thought of going in for Westminster Abbey myself at that time;
      but a fellow has so much to do, and-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What a pity that you didn't follow it up. A man of your powers, Mr.
      Neigh-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Afterwards I found I was too steady for it, and had too much of the
      respectable householder in me. Besides, so many other men are on the same
      tack; and then I didn't care about it, somehow.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't understand high art, and am utterly in the dark on what are the
      true laws of criticism,' a plain married lady, who wore archaeological
      jewellery, was saying at this time. 'But I know that I have derived an
      unusual amount of amusement from those verses, and I am heartily thankful
      to "E." for them.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am afraid,' said a gentleman who was suffering from a bad shirt-front,
      'that an estimate which depends upon feeling in that way is not to be
      trusted as permanent opinion.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The subject now flitted to the other end.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Somebody has it that when the heart flies out before the understanding,
      it saves the judgment a world of pains,' came from a voice in that
      quarter.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I, for my part, like something merry,' said an elderly woman, whose face
      was bisected by the edge of a shadow, which toned her forehead and eyelids
      to a livid neutral tint, and left her cheeks and mouth like metal at a
      white heat in the uninterrupted light. 'I think the liveliness of those
      ballads as great a recommendation as any. After all, enough misery is
      known to us by our experiences and those of our friends, and what we see
      in the newspapers, for all purposes of chastening, without having
      gratuitous grief inflicted upon us.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But you would not have wished that "Romeo and Juliet" should have ended
      happily, or that Othello should have discovered the perfidy of his Ancient
      in time to prevent all fatal consequences?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am not afraid to go so far as that,' said the old lady. 'Shakespeare is
      not everybody, and I am sure that thousands of people who have seen those
      plays would have driven home more cheerfully afterwards if by some
      contrivance the characters could all have been joined together
      respectively. I uphold our anonymous author on the general ground of her
      levity.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, it is an old and worn argument-that about the inexpedience of
      tragedy-and much may be said on both sides. It is not to be denied that
      the anonymous Sappho's verses-for it seems that she is really a woman-are
      clever.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Clever!' said Ladywell-the young man who had been one of the
      shooting-party at Sandbourne-'they are marvellously brilliant.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She is rather warm in her assumed character.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's a sign of her actual coldness; she lets off her feeling in
      theoretic grooves, and there is sure to be none left for practical ones.
      Whatever seems to be the most prominent vice, or the most prominent virtue
      in anybody's writing is the one thing you are safest from in personal
      dealings with the writer.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, I don't mean to call her warmth of feeling a vice or virtue exactly-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I agree with you,' said Neigh to the last speaker but one, in tones as
      emphatic as they possibly could be without losing their proper character
      of indifference to the whole matter. 'Warm sentiment of any sort, whenever
      we have it, disturbs us too much to leave us repose enough for writing it
      down.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am sure, when I was at the ardent age,' said the mistress of the house,
      in a tone of pleasantly agreeing with every one, particularly those who
      were diametrically opposed to each other, 'I could no more have printed
      such emotions and made them public than I-could have helped privately
      feeling them.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I wonder if she has gone through half she says? If so, what an
      experience!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no-not at all likely,' said Mr. Neigh. 'It is as risky to calculate
      people's ways of living from their writings as their incomes from their
      way of living.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She is as true to nature as fashion is false,' said the painter, in his
      warmth becoming scarcely complimentary, as sometimes happens with young
      persons. 'I don't think that she has written a word more than what every
      woman would deny feeling in a society where no woman says what she means
      or does what she says. And can any praise be greater than that?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ha-ha! Capital!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'All her verses seem to me,' said a rather stupid person, 'to be simply-
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    "Tral'-la-la-lal'-la-la-la',
    Tral'-la-la-lal'-la-la-lu',
    Tral'-la-la-lal'-la-la-lalla',
    Tral'-la-la-lu'."
</pre>
    <p>
      When you take away the music there is nothing left. Yet she is plainly a
      woman of great culture.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Have you seen what the London Light says about them-one of the finest
      things I have ever read in the way of admiration?' continued Ladywell,
      paying no attention to the previous speaker. He lingered for a reply, and
      then impulsively quoted several lines from the periodical he had named,
      without aid or hesitation. 'Good, is it not?' added Ladywell.
    </p>
    <p>
      They assented, but in such an unqualified manner that half as much
      readiness would have meant more. But Ladywell, though not experienced
      enough to be quite free from enthusiasm, was too experienced to mind
      indifference for more than a minute or two. When the ladies had withdrawn,
      the young man went on-
    </p>
    <p>
      'Colonel Staff said a funny thing to me yesterday about these very poems.
      He asked me if I knew her, and-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Her? Why, he knows that it is a lady all the time, and we were only just
      now doubting whether the sex of the writer could be really what it seems.
      Shame, Ladywell!' said his friend Neigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, Mr. Ladywell,' said another, 'now we have found you out. You know
      her!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now-I say-ha-ha!' continued the painter, with a face expressing that he
      had not at all tried to be found out as the man possessing incomparably
      superior knowledge of the poetess. 'I beg pardon really, but don't press
      me on the matter. Upon my word the secret is not my own. As I was saying,
      the Colonel said, "Do you know her?"-but you don't care to hear?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'We shall be delighted!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'So the Colonel said, "Do you know her?" adding, in a most comic way,
      "Between U. and E., Ladywell, I believe there is a close affinity"-meaning
      me, you know, by U. Just like the Colonel-ha-ha-ha!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The older men did not oblige Ladywell a second time with any attempt at
      appreciation; but a weird silence ensued, during which the smile upon
      Ladywell's face became frozen to painful permanence.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Meaning by E., you know, the "E" of the poems-heh-heh!' he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It was a very humorous incident certainly,' said his friend Neigh, at
      which there was a laugh-not from anything connected with what he said, but
      simply because it was the right thing to laugh when Neigh meant you to do
      so.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now don't, Neigh-you are too hard upon me. But, seriously, two or three
      fellows were there when I said it, and they all began laughing-but, then,
      the Colonel said it in such a queer way, you know. But you were asking me
      about her? Well, the fact is, between ourselves, I do know that she is a
      lady; and I don't mind telling a word-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But we would not for the world be the means of making you betray her
      confidence-would we, Jones?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, indeed; we would not.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, no; it is not that at all-this is really too bad!-you must listen
      just for a moment-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ladywell, don't betray anybody on our account.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Whoever the illustrious young lady may be she has seen a great deal of
      the world,' said Mr. Doncastle blandly, 'and puts her experience of the
      comedy of its emotions, and of its method of showing them, in a very vivid
      light.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I heard a man say that the novelty with which the ideas are presented is
      more noticeable than the originality of the ideas themselves,' observed
      Neigh. 'The woman has made a great talk about herself; and I am quite
      weary of people asking of her condition, place of abode, has she a father,
      has she a mother, or dearer one yet than all other.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I would have burlesque quotation put down by Act of Parliament, and all
      who dabble in it placed with him who can cite Scripture for his purposes,'
      said Ladywell, in retaliation.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a pause Neigh remarked half-privately to their host, who was his
      uncle: 'Your butler Chickerel is a very intelligent man, as I have heard.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, he does very well,' said Mr. Doncastle.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But is he not a-very extraordinary man?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not to my knowledge,' said Doncastle, looking up surprised. 'Why do you
      think that, Alfred?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, perhaps it was not a matter to mention. He reads a great deal, I
      dare say?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't think so.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I noticed how wonderfully his face kindled when we began talking about
      the poems during dinner. Perhaps he is a poet himself in disguise. Did you
      observe it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No. To the best of my belief he is a very trustworthy and honourable man.
      He has been with us-let me see, how long?-five months, I think, and he was
      fifteen years in his last place. It certainly is a new side to his
      character if he publicly showed any interest in the conversation, whatever
      he might have felt.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Since the matter has been mentioned,' said Mr. Jones, 'I may say that I
      too noticed the singularity of it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If you had not said otherwise,' replied Doncastle somewhat warmly, 'I
      should have asserted him to be the last man-servant in London to infringe
      such an elementary rule. If he did so this evening, it is certainly for
      the first time, and I sincerely hope that no annoyance was caused-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no, no-not at all-it might have been a mistake of mine,' said Jones. 'I
      should quite have forgotten the circumstance if Mr. Neigh's words had not
      brought it to my mind. It was really nothing to notice, and I beg that you
      will not say a word to him about it on my account.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He has a taste that way, my dear uncle, nothing more, depend upon it,'
      said Neigh. 'If I had such a man belonging to me I should only be too
      proud. Certainly do not mention it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of course Chickerel is Chickerel,' Mr. Doncastle rejoined. 'We all know
      what that means. And really, on reflecting, I do remember that he is of a
      literary turn of mind-not further by an inch than is commendable, you
      know. I am quite aware as I glance down the papers and prints any morning
      that Chickerel's eyes have been over the ground before mine, and that he
      generally forestalls the rest of us by a chapter or so in the last new
      book sent home; but in these vicious days that particular weakness is
      really virtue, just because it is not quite a vice.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' said Mr. Jones, the reflective man in spectacles, 'positive virtues
      are getting moved off the stage: negative ones are moved on to the place
      of positives; we thank bare justice as we used only to thank generosity;
      call a man honest who steals only by law, and consider him a benefactor if
      he does not steal at all.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hear, hear!' said Neigh. 'We will decide that Chickerel is even a better
      trained fellow than if he had shown no interest at all in his face.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The action being like those trifling irregularities in art at its
      vigorous periods, which seemed designed to hide the unpleasant monotony of
      absolute symmetry,' said Ladywell.
    </p>
    <p>
      'On the other hand, an affected want of training of that sort would be
      even a better disguise for an artful man than a perfectly impassible
      demeanour. He is two removes from discovery in a hidden scheme, whilst a
      neutral face is only one.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You quite alarm me by these subtle theories,' said Mr. Doncastle,
      laughing; and the subject then became compounded with other matters, till
      the speakers rose to rejoin the charming flock upstairs.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      In the basement story at this hour Mr. Chickerel the butler, who had
      formed the subject of discussion on the floor above, was busily engaged in
      looking after his two subordinates as they bustled about in the operations
      of clearing away. He was a man of whom, if the shape of certain bones and
      muscles of the face is ever to be taken as a guide to the character, one
      might safely have predicated conscientiousness in the performance of
      duties, a thorough knowledge of all that appertained to them, a general
      desire to live on without troubling his mind about anything which did not
      concern him. Any person interested in the matter would have assumed
      without hesitation that the estimate his employer had given of Chickerel
      was a true one-more, that not only would the butler under all ordinary
      circumstances resolutely prevent his face from showing curiosity in an
      unbecoming way, but that, with the soul of a true gentleman, he would, if
      necessary, equivocate as readily as the noblest of his betters to remove
      any stain upon his honour in such trifles. Hence it is apparent that if
      Chickerel's countenance really appeared, as Neigh had asserted, full of
      curiosity with regard to the gossip that was going on, the feelings which
      led to the exhibition must have been of a very unusual and irrepressible
      kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      His hair was of that peculiar bluish-white which is to be observed when
      the oncoming years, instead of singling out special locks of a man's head
      for operating against, advance uniformly over the whole field, and
      enfeeble the colour at all points before absolutely extinguishing it
      anywhere; his nose was of the knotty shape in the gristle and earthward
      tendency in the flesh which is commonly said to carry sound judgment above
      it, his eyes were thoughtful, and his face was thin-a contour which, if it
      at once abstracted from his features that cheerful assurance of
      single-minded honesty which adorns the exteriors of so many of his
      brethren, might have raised a presumption in the minds of some beholders
      that perhaps in this case the quality might not be altogether wanting
      within.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coffee having been served to the people upstairs, one of the footmen
      rushed into his bedroom on the lower floor, and in a few minutes emerged
      again in the dress of a respectable clerk who had been born for better
      things, with the trifling exceptions that he wore a low-crowned hat, and
      instead of knocking his heels on the pavement walked with a gait as
      delicate as a lady's. Going out of the area-door with a cigar in his
      mouth, he mounted the steps hastily to keep an appointment round the
      corner-the keeping of which as a private gentleman necessitated the change
      of the greater part of his clothes twice within a quarter of an hour-the
      limit of his time of absence. The other footman was upstairs, and the
      butler, finding that he had a few minutes to himself, sat down at the
      table and wrote:-
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
'MY DEAR ETHELBERTA,-I did not intend to write to you for some few
days to come, but the way in which you have been talked about here this
evening makes me anxious to send a line or two at once, though I
have very little time to spare, as usual. We have just had a
dinner-party-indeed the carriages have not yet been brought round-and
the talk at dinner was about your verses, of course. The thing was
brought up by a young fellow named Ladywell-do you know him? He is a
painter by profession, but he has a pretty good private income beyond
what he gets by practising his line of business among the nobility,
and that I expect is not little, for he is well known, and encouraged
because he is young, and good-looking, and so forth. His family own a
good bit of land somewhere out Aldbrickham way. However, I am before my
story. From what they all said it is pretty clear that you are thought
a great deal of in fashionable society as a poetess-but perhaps you know
this as well as I-moving in it as you do yourself, my dear.

    'The ladies afterwards got very curious about your age, so curious, in fact, and so full of certainty that you were thirty-five and a blighted existence, if an hour, that I felt inclined to rap out there and then, and hang what came of it: "My daughter, ladies, was to my own and her mother's certain knowledge only twenty-one last birthday, and has as bright a heart as anybody in London."  One of them actually said that you must be fifty to have got such an experience.  Her guess was a very shrewd one in the bottom of it, however, for it was grounded upon the way you use those strange experiences of mine in the society that I tell you of, and dress them up as if they were yours; and, as you see, she hit off my own age to a year.  I thought it was very sharp of her to be so right, although so wrong.

    'I do not want to influence your plans in any way about things which your school learning fits you to understand much better than I, who never had such opportunities, but I think that if I were in your place, Berta, I would not let my name be known just yet, for people always want what's kept from them, and don't value what's given.  I am not sure, but I think that after the women had gone upstairs the others turned their thoughts upon you again; what they said about you I don't know, for if there's one thing I hate 'tis hanging about the doors when the men begin to get moved by their wine, which they did to a large extent to-night, and spoke very loud.  They always do here, for old Don is a hearty giver in his way.  However, as you see these people from their own level now, it is not much that I can tell you in seeing them only from the under side, though I see strange things sometimes, and of course-

       "What great ones do the less will prattle of,"

    as it says in that book of select pieces that you gave me.

    'Well, my dear girl, I hope you will prosper.  One thing above all others you'll have to mind, and it is that folk must continually strain to advance in order to remain where they are: and you particularly.  But as for trying too hard, I wouldn't do it.  Much lies in minding this, that your best plan for lightness of heart is to raise yourself a little higher than your old mates, but not so high as to be quite out of their reach.  All human beings enjoy themselves from the outside, and so getting on a little has this good in it, you still keep in your old class where your feelings are, and are thoughtfully treated by this class: while by getting on too much you are sneered at by your new acquaintance, who don't know the skill of your rise, and you are parted from and forgot by the old ones who do.  Whatever happens, don't be too quick to feel.  You will surely get some hard blows when you are found out, for if the great can find no excuse for hitting with a mind, they'll do it and say 'twas in fun.  But you are young and healthy, and youth and health are power.  I wish I could have a decent footman here with me, but I suppose it is no use trying.  It is such men as these that provoke the contempt we get.  Well, thank God a few years will see the end of me, for I am growing ashamed of my company-so different as they are to the servants of old times.-Your affectionate father,             R. CHICKEREL.

    'P.S.-Do not press Lady Petherwin any further to remove the rules on which you live with her.  She is quite right: she cannot keep us, and to recognize us would do you no good, nor us either.  We are content to see you secretly, since it is best for you.'

      8. CHRISTOPHER'S LODGINGS-THE GROUNDS ABOUT ROOKINGTON
    </h2>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, in the distant town of Sandbourne, Christopher Julian had
      recovered from the weariness produced by his labours at the Wyndway
      evening-party where Ethelberta had been a star. Instead of engaging his
      energies to clear encumbrances from the tangled way of his life, he now
      set about reading the popular 'Metres by E.' with more interest and
      assiduity than ever; for though Julian was a thinker by instinct, he was a
      worker by effort only; and the higher of these kinds being dependent upon
      the lower for its exhibition, there was often a lamentable lack of
      evidence of his power in either. It is a provoking correlation, and has
      conduced to the obscurity of many a genius.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Kit,' said his sister, on reviving at the end of the bad headache which
      had followed the dance, 'those poems seem to have increased in value with
      you. The lady, lofty as she appears to be, would be flattered if she only
      could know how much you study them. Have you decided to thank her for
      them? Now let us talk it over-I like having a chat about such a pretty new
      subject.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I would thank her in a moment if I were absolutely certain that she had
      anything to do with sending them, or even writing them. I am not quite
      sure of that yet.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How strange that a woman could bring herself to write those verses!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not at all strange-they are natural outpourings.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Faith looked critically at the remoter caverns of the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why strange?' continued Christopher. 'There is no harm in them.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no-no harm. But I cannot explain to you-unless you see it partly of
      your own accord-that to write them she must be rather a fast lady-not a
      bad fast lady; a nice fast lady, I mean, of course. There, I have said it
      now, and I daresay you are vexed with me, for your interest in her has
      deepened to what it originally was, I think. I don't mean any absolute
      harm by "fast," Kit.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Bold, forward, you mean, I suppose?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Faith tried to hit upon a better definition which should meet all views;
      and, on failing to do so, looked concerned at her brother's somewhat
      grieved appearance, and said, helplessly, 'Yes, I suppose I do.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'My idea of her is quite the reverse. A poetess must intrinsically be
      sensitive, or she could never feel: but then, frankness is a rhetorical
      necessity even with the most modest, if their inspirations are to do any
      good in the world. You will, for certain, not be interested in something I
      was going to tell you, which I thought would have pleased you immensely;
      but it is not worth mentioning now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If you will not tell me, never mind. But don't be crabbed, Kit! You know
      how interested I am in all your affairs.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is only that I have composed an air to one of the prettiest of her
      songs, "When tapers tall"-but I am not sure about the power of it. This is
      how it begins-I threw it off in a few minutes, after you had gone to bed.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to the piano and lightly touched over an air, the manuscript copy
      of which he placed in front of him, and listened to hear her opinion,
      having proved its value frequently; for it was not that of a woman merely,
      but impersonally human. Though she was unknown to fame, this was a great
      gift in Faith, since to have an unsexed judgment is as precious as to be
      an unsexed being is deplorable.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is very fair indeed,' said the sister, scarcely moving her lips in her
      great attention. 'Now again, and again, and again. How could you do it in
      the time!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Kit knew that she admired his performance: passive assent was her usual
      praise, and she seldom insisted vigorously upon any view of his
      compositions unless for purposes of emendation.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I was thinking that, as I cannot very well write to her, I may as well
      send her this,' said Christopher, with lightened spirits, voice to
      correspond, and eyes likewise; 'there can be no objection to it, for such
      things are done continually. Consider while I am gone, Faith. I shall be
      out this evening for an hour or two.'
    </p>
    <p>
      When Christopher left the house shortly after, instead of going into the
      town on some errand, as was customary whenever he went from home after
      dark, he ascended a back street, passed over the hills behind, and walked
      at a brisk pace inland along the road to Rookington Park, where, as he had
      learnt, Ethelberta and Lady Petherwin were staying for a time, the day or
      two which they spent at Wyndway having formed a short break in the middle
      of this visit. The moon was shining to-night, and Christopher sped onwards
      over the pallid high-road as readily as he could have done at noonday. In
      three-quarters of an hour he reached the park gates; and entering now upon
      a tract which he had never before explored, he went along more cautiously
      and with some uncertainty as to the precise direction that the road would
      take. A frosted expanse of even grass, on which the shadow of his head
      appeared with an opal halo round it, soon allowed the house to be
      discovered beyond, the other portions of the park abounding with timber
      older and finer than that of any other spot in the neighbourhood.
      Christopher withdrew into the shade, and wheeled round to the front of the
      building that contained his old love. Here he gazed and idled, as many a
      man has done before him-wondering which room the fair poetess occupied,
      waiting till lights began to appear in the upper windows-which they did as
      uncertainly as glow-worms bHANDlinking up at eventide-and warming with
      currents of revived feeling in perhaps the sweetest of all conditions. New
      love is brightest, and long love is greatest; but revived love is the
      tenderest thing known upon earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Occupied thus, Christopher was greatly surprised to see, on casually
      glancing to one side, another man standing close to the shadowy trunk of
      another tree, in a similar attitude to his own, gazing, with arms folded,
      as blankly at the windows of the house as Christopher himself had been
      gazing. Not willing to be discovered, Christopher stuck closer to his
      tree. While he waited thus, the stranger began murmuring words, in a slow
      soft voice. Christopher listened till he heard the following:-
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    'Pale was the day and rayless, love,
       That had an eve so dim.'
</pre>
    <p>
      Two well-known lines from one of Ethelberta's poems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jealousy is a familiar kind of heat which disfigures, licks playfully,
      clouds, blackens, and boils a man as a fire does a pot; and on recognizing
      these pilferings from what he had grown to regard as his own treasury,
      Christopher's fingers began to nestle with great vigour in the palms of
      his hands. Three or four minutes passed, when the unknown rival gave a
      last glance at the windows, and walked away. Christopher did not like the
      look of that walk at all-there was grace enough in it to suggest that his
      antagonist had no mean chance of finding favour in a woman's eyes. A sigh,
      too, seemed to proceed from the stranger's breast; but as their distance
      apart was too great for any such sound to be heard by any possibility,
      Christopher set down that to imagination, or to the brushing of the wind
      over the trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lighted windows went out one by one, and all the house was in
      darkness. Julian then walked off himself, with a vigour that was spasmodic
      only, and with much less brightness of mind than he had experienced on his
      journey hither. The stranger had gone another way, and Christopher saw no
      more of him. When he reached Sandbourne, Faith was still sitting up.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But I told you I was going to take a long walk,' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, Christopher: really you did not. How tired and sad you do look-though
      I always know beforehand when you are in that state: one of your feet has
      a drag about it as you pass along the pavement outside the window.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, I forgot that I did not tell you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not begin to describe his pilgrimage: it was too silly a thing
      even for her to hear of.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It does not matter at all about my staying up,' said Faith assuringly;
      'that is, if exercise benefits you. Walking up and down the lane, I
      suppose?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No; not walking up and down the lane.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The turnpike-road to Rookington is pleasant.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Faith, that is really where I have been. How came you to know?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I only guessed. Verses and an accidental meeting produce a special
      journey.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ethelberta is a fine woman, physically and mentally, both. I wonder
      people do not talk about her twice as much as they do.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then surely you are getting attached to her again. You think you discover
      in her more than anybody else does; and love begins with a sense of
      superior discernment.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, no. That is only nonsense,' he said hurriedly. 'However, love her or
      love her not, I can keep a corner of my heart for you, Faith. There is
      another brute after her too, it seems.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of course there is: I expect there are many. Her position in society is
      above ours, so that it is an unwise course to go troubling yourself more
      about her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No. If a needy man must be so foolish as to fall in love, it is best to
      do so where he cannot double his foolishness by marrying the woman.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't like to hear you talk so slightingly of what poor father did.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher fixed his attention on the supper. That night, late as it was,
      when Faith was in bed and sleeping, he sat before a sheet of music-paper,
      neatly copying his composition upon it. The manuscript was intended as an
      offering to Ethelberta at the first convenient opportunity.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      'Well, after all my trouble to find out about Ethelberta, here comes the
      clue unasked for,' said the musician to his sister a few days later.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned and saw that he was reading the Wessex Reflector.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What is it?' asked Faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The secret of the true authorship of the book is out at last, and it is
      Ethelberta of course. I am so glad to have it proved hers.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But can we believe-?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O yes. Just hear what "Our London Correspondent" says. It is one of the
      nicest bits of gossip that he has furnished us with for a long time.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes: now read it, do.'
    </p>
    <p>
      '"The author of 'Metres by E.'"' Christopher began, '"a book of which so
      much has been said and conjectured, and one, in fact, that has been the
      chief talk for several weeks past of the literary circles to which I
      belong, is a young lady who was a widow before she reached the age of
      eighteen, and is now not far beyond her fourth lustrum. I was additionally
      informed by a friend whom I met yesterday on his way to the House of
      Lords, that her name is Mrs. Petherwin-Christian name Ethelberta; and that
      she resides with her mother-in-law at their house in Exonbury Crescent.
      She is, moreover, the daughter of the late Bishop of Silchester (if report
      may be believed), whose active benevolence, as your readers know, left his
      family in comparatively straitened circumstances at his death. The
      marriage was a secret one, and much against the wish of her husband's
      friends, who are wealthy people on all sides. The death of the bridegroom
      two or three weeks after the wedding led to a reconciliation; and the
      young poetess was taken to the home which she still occupies, devoted to
      the composition of such brilliant effusions as those the world has lately
      been favoured with from her pen."'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If you want to send her your music, you can do so now,' said Faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I might have sent it before, but I wanted to deliver it personally.
      However, it is all the same now, I suppose, whether I send it or not. I
      always knew that our destinies would lie apart, though she was once
      temporarily under a cloud. Her momentary inspiration to write that
      "Cancelled Words" was the worst possible omen for me. It showed that,
      thinking me no longer useful as a practical chance, she would make me
      ornamental as a poetical regret. But I'll send the manuscript of the
      song.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'In the way of business, as a composer only; and you must say to yourself,
      "Ethelberta, as thou art but woman, I dare; but as widow I fear thee."'
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding Christopher's affected carelessness, that evening saw a
      great deal of nicety bestowed upon the operation of wrapping up and
      sending off the song. He dropped it into the box and heard it fall, and
      with the curious power which he possessed of setting his wisdom to watch
      any particular folly in himself that it could not hinder, speculated as he
      walked on the result of this first tangible step of return to his old
      position as Ethelberta's lover.

    <h2>
      9. A LADY'S DRAWING-ROOMS-ETHELBERTA'S DRESSING-ROOM
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was a house on the north side of Hyde Park, between ten and eleven in
      the evening, and several intelligent and courteous people had assembled
      there to enjoy themselves as far as it was possible to do so in a neutral
      way-all carefully keeping every variety of feeling in a state of solution,
      in spite of any attempt such feelings made from time to time to
      crystallize on interesting subjects in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Neigh, who is that charming woman with her head built up in a novel way
      even for hair architecture-the one with her back towards us?' said a man
      whose coat fitted doubtfully to a friend whose coat fitted well.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Just going to ask for the same information,' said Mr. Neigh, determining
      the very longest hair in his beard to an infinitesimal nicety by drawing
      its lower portion through his fingers. 'I have quite forgotten-cannot keep
      people's names in my head at all; nor could my father either-nor any of my
      family-a very odd thing. But my old friend Mrs. Napper knows for certain.'
      And he turned to one of a small group of middle-aged persons near, who,
      instead of skimming the surface of things in general, like the rest of the
      company, were going into the very depths of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O-that is the celebrated Mrs. Petherwin, the woman who makes rhymes and
      prints 'em,' said Mrs. Napper, in a detached sentence, and then continued
      talking again to those on the other side of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two loungers went on with their observations of Ethelberta's
      headdress, which, though not extraordinary or eccentric, did certainly
      convey an idea of indefinable novelty. Observers were sometimes half
      inclined to think that her cuts and modes were acquired by some secret
      communication with the mysterious clique which orders the livery of the
      fashionable world, for-and it affords a parallel to cases in which clever
      thinkers in other spheres arrive independently at one and the same
      conclusion-Ethelberta's fashion often turned out to be the coming one.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, is that the woman at last?' said Neigh, diminishing his broad general
      gaze at the room to a close criticism of Ethelberta.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"The rhymes," as Mrs. Napper calls them, are not to be despised,' said
      his companion. 'They are not quite virginibus puerisque, and the writer's
      opinions of life and society differ very materially from mine, but I
      cannot help admiring her in the more reflective pieces; the songs I don't
      care for. The method in which she handles curious subjects, and at the
      same time impresses us with a full conviction of her modesty, is very
      adroit, and somewhat blinds us to the fact that no such poems were
      demanded of her at all.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have not read them,' said Neigh, secretly wrestling with his jaw, to
      prevent a yawn; 'but I suppose I must. The truth is, that I never care
      much for reading what one ought to read; I wish I did, but I cannot help
      it. And, no doubt, you admire the lady immensely for writing them: I
      don't. Everybody is so talented now-a-days that the only people I care to
      honour as deserving real distinction are those who remain in obscurity. I
      am myself hoping for a corner in some biographical dictionary when the
      time comes for those works only to contain lists of the exceptional
      individuals of whom nothing is known but that they lived and died.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah-listen. They are going to sing one of her songs,' said his friend,
      looking towards a bustling movement in the neighbourhood of the piano. 'I
      believe that song, "When tapers tall," has been set to music by three or
      four composers already.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Men of any note?' said Neigh, at last beaten by his yawn, which courtesy
      nevertheless confined within his person to such an extent that only a few
      unimportant symptoms, such as reduced eyes and a certain rectangular
      manner of mouth in speaking, were visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Scarcely,' replied the other man. 'Established writers of music do not
      expend their energies upon new verse until they find that such verse is
      likely to endure; for should the poet be soon forgotten, their labour is
      in some degree lost.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Artful dogs-who would have thought it?' said Neigh, just as an exercise
      in words; and they drew nearer to the piano, less to become listeners to
      the singing than to be spectators of the scene in that quarter. But among
      some others the interest in the songs seemed to be very great; and it was
      unanimously wished that the young lady who had practised the different
      pieces of music privately would sing some of them now in the order of
      their composers' reputations. The musical persons in the room
      unconsciously resolved themselves into a committee of taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      One and another had been tried, when, at the end of the third, a lady
      spoke to Ethelberta.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now, Mrs. Petherwin,' she said, gracefully throwing back her face, 'your
      opinion is by far the most valuable. In which of the cases do you consider
      the marriage of verse and tune to have been most successful?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta, finding these and other unexpected calls made upon herself,
      came to the front without flinching.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The sweetest and the best that I like by far,' she said, 'is none of
      these. It is one which reached me by post only this morning from a place
      in Wessex, and is written by an unheard-of man who lives somewhere down
      there-a man who will be, nevertheless, heard a great deal of some day, I
      hope-think. I have only practised it this afternoon; but, if one's own
      judgment is worth anything, it is the best.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Let us have your favourite, by all means,' said another friend of
      Ethelberta's who was present-Mrs. Doncastle.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am so sorry that I cannot oblige you, since you wish to hear it,'
      replied the poetess regretfully; 'but the music is at home. I had not
      received it when I lent the others to Miss Belmaine, and it is only in
      manuscript like the rest.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Could it not be sent for?' suggested an enthusiast who knew that
      Ethelberta lived only in the next street, appealing by a look to her, and
      then to the mistress of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Certainly, let us send for it,' said that lady. A footman was at once
      quietly despatched with precise directions as to where Christopher's sweet
      production might be found.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What-is there going to be something interesting?' asked a young married
      friend of Mrs. Napper, who had returned to her original spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes-the best song she has written is to be sung in the best manner to the
      best air that has been composed for it. I should not wonder if she were
      going to sing it herself.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Did you know anything of Mrs. Petherwin until her name leaked out in
      connection with these ballads?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No; but I think I recollect seeing her once before. She is one of those
      people who are known, as one may say, by subscription: everybody knows a
      little, till she is astonishingly well known altogether; but nobody knows
      her entirely. She was the orphan child of some clergyman, I believe. Lady
      Petherwin, her mother-in-law, has been taking her about a great deal
      latterly.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She has apparently a very good prospect.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes; and it is through her being of that curious undefined character
      which interprets itself to each admirer as whatever he would like to have
      it. Old men like her because she is so girlish; youths because she is
      womanly; wicked men because she is good in their eyes; good men because
      she is wicked in theirs.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She must be a very anomalous sort of woman, at that rate.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. Like the British Constitution, she owes her success in practice to
      her inconsistencies in principle.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'These poems must have set her up. She appears to be quite the correct
      spectacle. Happy Mrs. Petherwin!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The subject of their dialogue was engaged in a conversation with Mrs.
      Belmaine upon the management of households-a theme provoked by a
      discussion that was in progress in the pages of some periodical of the
      time. Mrs. Belmaine was very full of the argument, and went on from point
      to point till she came to servants.
    </p>
    <p>
      The face of Ethelberta showed caution at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I consider that Lady Plamby pets her servants by far too much,' said Mrs.
      Belmaine. 'O, you do not know her? Well, she is a woman with theories; and
      she lends her maids and men books of the wrong kind for their station, and
      sends them to picture exhibitions which they don't in the least
      understand-all for the improvement of their taste, and morals, and nobody
      knows what besides. It only makes them dissatisfied.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The face of Ethelberta showed venturesomeness. 'Yes, and dreadfully
      ambitious!' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, indeed. What a turn the times have taken! People of that sort push
      on, and get into business, and get great warehouses, until at last,
      without ancestors, or family, or name, or estate-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Or the merest scrap of heirloom or family jewel.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Or heirlooms, or family jewels, they are thought as much of as if their
      forefathers had glided unobtrusively through the peerage-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ever since the first edition.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes.' Mrs. Belmaine, who really sprang from a good old family, had been
      going to say, 'for the last seven hundred years,' but fancying from
      Ethelberta's addendum that she might not date back more than a trifling
      century or so, adopted the suggestion with her usual well-known courtesy,
      and blushed down to her locket at the thought of the mistake that she
      might have made. This sensitiveness was a trait in her character which
      gave great gratification to her husband, and, indeed, to all who knew her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And have you any theory on the vexed question of servant-government?'
      continued Mrs. Belmaine, smiling. 'But no-the subject is of far too
      practical a nature for one of your bent, of course.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no-it is not at all too practical. I have thought of the matter often,'
      said Ethelberta. 'I think the best plan would be for somebody to write a
      pamphlet, "The Shortest Way with the Servants," just as there was once
      written a terribly stinging one, "The Shortest Way with the Dissenters,"
      which had a great effect.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have always understood that that was written by a dissenter as a satire
      upon the Church?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah-so it was: but the example will do to illustrate my meaning.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Quite so-I understand-so it will,' said Mrs. Belmaine, with clouded
      faculties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Christopher's music had arrived. An accomplished gentleman who
      had every musical talent except that of creation, scanned the notes
      carefully from top to bottom, and sat down to accompany the singer. There
      was no lady present of sufficient confidence or skill to venture into a
      song she had never seen before, and the only one who had seen it was
      Ethelberta herself; she did not deny having practised it the greater part
      of the afternoon, and was very willing to sing it now if anybody would
      derive pleasure from the performance. Then she began, and the sweetness of
      her singing was such that even the most unsympathetic honoured her by
      looking as if they would be willing to listen to every note the song
      contained if it were not quite so much trouble to do so. Some were so
      interested that, instead of continuing their conversation, they remained
      in silent consideration of how they would continue it when she had
      finished; while the particularly civil people arranged their countenances
      into every attentive form that the mind could devise. One emotional
      gentleman looked at the corner of a chair as if, till that moment, such an
      object had never crossed his vision before; the movement of his finger to
      the imagined tune was, for a deaf old clergyman, a perfect mine of
      interest; whilst a young man from the country was powerless to put an end
      to an enchanted gaze at nothing at all in the exact middle of the room
      before him. Neigh, and the general phalanx of cool men and celebrated club
      yawners, were so much affected that they raised their chronic look of
      great objection to things, to an expression of scarcely any objection at
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What makes it so interesting,' said Mrs. Doncastle to Ethelberta, when
      the song was over and she had retired from the focus of the company, 'is,
      that it is played from the composer's own copy, which has never met the
      public eye, or any other than his own before to-day. And I see that he has
      actually sketched in the lines by hand, instead of having ruled paper-just
      as the great old composers used to do. You must have been as pleased to
      get it fresh from the stocks like that as he probably was pleased to get
      your thanks.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta became reflective. She had not thanked Christopher; moreover,
      she had decided, after some consideration, that she ought not to thank
      him. What new thoughts were suggested by that remark of Mrs. Doncastle's,
      and what new inclination resulted from the public presentation of his tune
      and her words as parts of one organic whole, are best explained by
      describing her doings at a later hour, when, having left her friends
      somewhat early, she had reached home and retired from public view for that
      evening.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Ethelberta went to her room, sent away the maid who did double duty for
herself and Lady Petherwin, walked in circles about the carpet till the
fire had grown haggard and cavernous, sighed, took a sheet of paper and
wrote:-

    'DEAR MR. JULIAN,-I have said I would not write: I have said it twice; but discretion, under some circumstances, is only another name for unkindness.  Before thanking you for your sweet gift, let me tell you in a few words of something which may materially change an aspect of affairs under which I appear to you to deserve it.

    'With regard to my history and origin you are altogether mistaken; and how can I tell whether your bitterness at my previous silence on those points may not cause you to withdraw your act of courtesy now?  But the gratification of having at last been honest with you may compensate even for the loss of your respect.

    'The matter is a small one to tell, after all.  What will you say on learning that I am not the trodden-down "lady by birth" that you have supposed me?  That my father is not dead, as you probably imagine; that he is working for his living as one among a peculiarly stigmatized and ridiculed multitude?

    'Had he been a brawny cottager, carpenter, mason, blacksmith, well-digger, navvy, tree-feller-any effective and manly trade, in short, a worker in which can stand up in the face of the noblest and daintiest, and bare his gnarled arms and say, with a consciousness of superior power, "Look at a real man!" I should have been able to show you antecedents which, if not intensely romantic, are not altogether antagonistic to romance.  But the present fashion of associating with one particular class everything that is ludicrous and bombastic overpowers me when I think of it in relation to myself and your known sensitiveness.  When the well-born poetess of good report melts into. . .'
</pre>
    <p>
      Having got thus far, a faint-hearted look, which had begun to show itself
      several sentences earlier, became pronounced. She threw the writing into
      the dull fire, poked and stirred it till a red inflammation crept over the
      sheet, and then started anew:-
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    'DEAR MR. JULIAN,-Not knowing your present rank as composer-whether on the very brink of fame, or as yet a long way off-I cannot decide what form of expression my earnest acknowledgments should take.  Let me simply say in one short phrase, I thank you infinitely!

    'I am no musician, and my opinion on music may not be worth much: yet I know what I like (as everybody says, but I do not use the words as a form to cover a hopeless blank on all connected with the subject), and this sweet air I love.  You must have glided like a breeze about me-seen into a heart not worthy of scrutiny, jotted down words that cannot justify attention-before you could have apotheosized the song in so exquisite a manner.  My gratitude took the form of wretchedness when, on hearing the effect of the ballad in public this evening, I thought that I had not power to withhold a reply which might do us both more harm than good.  Then I said, "Away with all emotion-I wish the world was drained dry of it-I will take no notice," when a lady whispered at my elbow to the effect that of course I had expressed my gratification to you.  I ought first to have mentioned that your creation has been played to-night to full drawing-rooms, and the original tones cooled the artificial air like a fountain almost.

    'I prophesy great things of you.  Perhaps, at the time when we are each but a row of bones in our individual graves, your genius will be remembered, while my mere cleverness will have been long forgotten.

    'But-you must allow a woman of experience to say this-the undoubted power that you possess will do you socially no good unless you mix with it the ingredient of ambition-a quality in which I fear you are very deficient.  It is in the hope of stimulating you to a better opinion of yourself that I write this letter.

    'Probably I shall never meet you again.  Not that I think circumstances to be particularly powerful to prevent such a meeting, rather it is that I shall energetically avoid it.  There can be no such thing as strong friendship between a man and a woman not of one family.

    'More than that there must not be, and this is why we will not meet.  You see that I do not mince matters at all; but it is hypocrisy to avoid touching upon a subject which all men and women in our position inevitably think of, no matter what they say.  Some women might have written distantly, and wept at the repression of their real feeling; but it is better to be more frank, and keep a dry eye.-Yours,      ETHELBERTA.'
</pre>
    <p>
      Her feet felt cold and her heart weak as she directed the letter, and she
      was overpowered with weariness. But murmuring, 'If I let it stay till the
      morning I shall not send it, and a man may be lost to fame because of a
      woman's squeamishness-it shall go,' she partially dressed herself, wrapped
      a large cloak around her, descended the stairs, and went out to the
      pillar-box at the corner, leaving the door not quite close. No gust of
      wind had realized her misgivings that it might be blown shut on her
      return, and she re-entered as softly as she had emerged.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will be seen that Ethelberta had said nothing about her family after
      all.

      10. LADY PETHERWIN'S HOUSE
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next day old Lady Petherwin, who had not accompanied Ethelberta the
      night before, came into the morning-room, with a newspaper in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What does this mean, Ethelberta?' she inquired in tones from which every
      shade of human expressiveness was extracted by some awful and imminent
      mood that lay behind. She was pointing to a paragraph under the heading of
      'Literary Notes,' which contained in a few words the announcement of
      Ethelberta's authorship that had more circumstantially appeared in the
      Wessex Reflector.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It means what it says,' said Ethelberta quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then it is true?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. I must apologize for having kept it such a secret from you. It was
      not done in the spirit that you may imagine: it was merely to avoid
      disturbing your mind that I did it so privately.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But surely you have not written every one of those ribald verses?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta looked inclined to exclaim most vehemently against this; but
      what she actually did say was, '"Ribald"-what do you mean by that? I don't
      think that you are aware what "ribald" means.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am not sure that I am. As regards some words as well as some persons,
      the less you are acquainted with them the more it is to your credit.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't quite deserve this, Lady Petherwin.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Really, one would imagine that women wrote their books during those
      dreams in which people have no moral sense, to see how improper some, even
      virtuous, ladies become when they get into print.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I might have done a much more unnatural thing than write those poems. And
      perhaps I might have done a much better thing, and got less praise. But
      that's the world's fault, not mine.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You might have left them unwritten, and shown more fidelity.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Fidelity! it is more a matter of humour than principle. What has fidelity
      to do with it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Fidelity to my dear boy's memory.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It would be difficult to show that because I have written so-called
      tender and gay verse, I feel tender and gay. It is too often assumed that
      a person's fancy is a person's real mind. I believe that in the majority
      of cases one is fond of imagining the direct opposite of one's principles
      in sheer effort after something fresh and free; at any rate, some of the
      lightest of those rhymes were composed between the deepest fits of dismals
      I have ever known. However, I did expect that you might judge in the way
      you have judged, and that was my chief reason for not telling you what I
      had done.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You don't deny that you tried to escape from recollections you ought to
      have cherished? There is only one thing that women of your sort are as
      ready to do as to take a man's name, and that is, drop his memory.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dear Lady Petherwin-don't be so unreasonable as to blame a live person
      for living! No woman's head is so small as to be filled for life by a
      memory of a few months. Four years have passed since I last saw my
      boy-husband. We were mere children; see how I have altered since in mind,
      substance, and outline-I have even grown half an inch taller since his
      death. Two years will exhaust the regrets of widows who have long been
      faithful wives; and ought I not to show a little new life when my husband
      died in the honeymoon?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No. Accepting the protection of your husband's mother was, in effect, an
      avowal that you rejected the idea of being a widow to prolong the idea of
      being a wife; and the sin against your conventional state thus assumed is
      almost as bad as would have been a sin against the married state itself.
      If you had gone off when he died, saying, "Thank heaven, I am free!" you
      would, at any rate, have shown some real honesty.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I should have been more virtuous by being more unfeeling. That often
      happens.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have taken to you, and made a great deal of you-given you the
      inestimable advantages of foreign travel and good society to enlarge your
      mind. In short, I have been like a Naomi to you in everything, and I
      maintain that writing these poems saps the foundation of it all.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I do own that you have been a very good Naomi to me thus far; but Ruth
      was quite a fast widow in comparison with me, and yet Naomi never blamed
      her. You are unfortunate in your illustration. But it is dreadfully
      flippant of me to answer you like this, for you have been kind. But why
      will you provoke me!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, you are flippant, Ethelberta. You are too much given to that sort of
      thing.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I don't know how the secret of my name has leaked out; and I am not
      ribald, or anything you say,' said Ethelberta, with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then you own you do not feel so ardent as you seem in your book?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I do own it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And that you are sorry your name has been published in connection with
      it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And you think the verses may tend to misrepresent your character as a gay
      and rapturous one, when it is not?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I do fear it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then, of course, you will suppress the poems instantly. That is the only
      way in which you can regain the position you have hitherto held with me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta said nothing; and the dull winter atmosphere had far from light
      enough in it to show by her face what she might be thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well?' said Lady Petherwin.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I did not expect such a command as that,' said Ethelberta. 'I have been
      obedient for four years, and would continue so-but I cannot suppress the
      poems. They are not mine now to suppress.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You must get them into your hands. Money will do it, I suppose?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, I suppose it would-a thousand pounds.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very well; the money shall be forthcoming,' said Lady Petherwin, after a
      pause. 'You had better sit down and write about it at once.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I cannot do it,' said Ethelberta; 'and I will not. I don't wish them to
      be suppressed. I am not ashamed of them; there is nothing to be ashamed of
      in them; and I shall not take any steps in the matter.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then you are an ungrateful woman, and wanting in natural affection for
      the dead! Considering your birth-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's an intolerable-'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Petherwin crashed out of the room in a wind of indignation, and went
      upstairs and heard no more. Adjoining her chamber was a smaller one called
      her study, and, on reaching this, she unlocked a cabinet, took out a small
      deed-box, removed from it a folded packet, unfolded it, crumpled it up,
      and turning round suddenly flung it into the fire. Then she stood and
      beheld it eaten away word after word by the flames, 'Testament'-'all that
      freehold'-'heirs and assigns' appearing occasionally for a moment only to
      disappear for ever. Nearly half the document had turned into a glossy
      black when the lady clasped her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What have I done!' she exclaimed. Springing to the tongs she seized with
      them the portion of the writing yet unconsumed, and dragged it out of the
      fire. Ethelberta appeared at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Quick, Ethelberta!' said Lady Petherwin. 'Help me to put this out!' And
      the two women went trampling wildly upon the document and smothering it
      with a corner of the hearth-rug.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What is it?' said Ethelberta.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My will!' said Lady Petherwin. 'I have kept it by me lately, for I have
      wished to look over it at leisure-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good heavens!' said Ethelberta. 'And I was just coming in to tell you
      that I would always cling to you, and never desert you, ill-use me how you
      might!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Such an affectionate remark sounds curious at such a time,' said Lady
      Petherwin, sinking down in a chair at the end of the struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But,' cried Ethelberta, 'you don't suppose-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Selfishness, my dear, has given me such crooked looks that I can see it
      round a corner.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If you mean that what is yours to give may not be mine to take, it would
      be as well to name it in an impersonal way, if you must name it at all,'
      said the daughter-in-law, with wet eyelids. 'God knows I had no selfish
      thought in saying that. I came upstairs to ask you to forgive me, and knew
      nothing about the will. But every explanation distorts it all the more!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'We two have got all awry, dear-it cannot be concealed-awry-awry. Ah, who
      shall set us right again? However, now I must send for Mr. Chancerly-no, I
      am going out on other business, and I will call upon him. There, don't
      spoil your eyes: you may have to sell them.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She rang the bell and ordered the carriage; and half-an-hour later Lady
      Petherwin's coachman drove his mistress up to the door of her lawyer's
      office in Lincoln's Inn Fields.

    <h2>
      11. SANDBOURNE AND ITS NEIGHBOURHOOD-SOME LONDON STREETS
    </h2>
    <p>
      While this was going on in town, Christopher, at his lodgings in
      Sandbourne, had been thrown into rare old visions and dreams by the
      appearance of Ethelberta's letter. Flattered and encouraged to ambition as
      well as to love by her inspiriting sermon, he put off now the last remnant
      of cynical doubt upon the genuineness of his old mistress, and once and
      for all set down as disloyal a belief he had latterly acquired that 'Come,
      woo me, woo me; for I am like enough to consent,' was all a young woman
      had to tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the reasoning of political and social economists would not have
      convinced Christopher that he had a better chance in London than in
      Sandbourne of making a decent income by reasonable and likely labour; but
      a belief in a far more improbable proposition, impetuously expressed,
      warmed him with the idea that he might become famous there. The greater is
      frequently more readily credited than the less, and an argument which will
      not convince on a matter of halfpence appears unanswerable when applied to
      questions of glory and honour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The regulation wet towel and strong coffee of the ambitious and
      intellectual student floated before him in visions; but it was with a
      sense of relief that he remembered that music, in spite of its drawbacks
      as a means of sustenance, was a profession happily unencumbered with those
      excruciating preliminaries to greatness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher talked about the new move to his sister, and he was vexed that
      her hopefulness was not roused to quite the pitch of his own. As with
      others of his sort, his too general habit of accepting the most clouded
      possibility that chances offered was only transcended by his readiness to
      kindle with a fitful excitement now and then. Faith was much more equable.
      'If you were not the most melancholy man God ever created,' she said,
      kindly looking at his vague deep eyes and thin face, which was but a few
      degrees too refined and poetical to escape the epithet of lantern-jawed
      from any one who had quarrelled with him, 'you would not mind my coolness
      about this. It is a good thing of course to go; I have always fancied that
      we were mistaken in coming here. Mediocrity stamped "London" fetches more
      than talent marked "provincial." But I cannot feel so enthusiastic.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Still, if we are to go, we may as well go by enthusiasm as by
      calculation; it is a sensation pleasanter to the nerves, and leads to just
      as good a result when there is only one result possible.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very well,' said Faith. 'I will not depress you. If I had to describe you
      I should say you were a child in your impulses, and an old man in your
      reflections. Have you considered when we shall start?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What have you thought?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That we may very well leave the place in six weeks if we wish.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'We really may?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. And what is more, we will.'
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Christopher and Faith arrived in London on an afternoon at the end of
      winter, and beheld from one of the river bridges snow-white scrolls of
      steam from the tall chimneys of Lambeth, rising against the livid sky
      behind, as if drawn in chalk on toned cardboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first thing he did that evening, when settled in their apartments near
      the British Museum, before applying himself to the beginning of the means
      by which success in life might be attained, was to go out in the direction
      of Ethelberta's door, leaving Faith unpacking the things, and sniffing
      extraordinary smoke-smells which she discovered in all nooks and crannies
      of the rooms. It was some satisfaction to see Ethelberta's house, although
      the single feature in which it differed from the other houses in the
      Crescent was that no lamp shone from the fanlight over the entrance-a
      speciality which, if he cared for omens, was hardly encouraging. Fearing
      to linger near lest he might be detected, Christopher stole a glimpse at
      the door and at the steps, imagined what a trifle of the depression worn
      in each step her feet had tended to produce, and strolled home again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feeling that his reasons for calling just now were scarcely sufficient, he
      went next day about the business that had brought him to town, which
      referred to a situation as organist in a large church in the north-west
      district. The post was half ensured already, and he intended to make of it
      the nucleus of a professional occupation and income. Then he sat down to
      think of the preliminary steps towards publishing the song that had so
      pleased her, and had also, as far as he could understand from her letter,
      hit the popular taste very successfully; a fact which, however little it
      may say for the virtues of the song as a composition, was a great
      recommendation to it as a property. Christopher was delighted to perceive
      that out of this position he could frame an admissible, if not an
      unimpeachable, reason for calling upon Ethelberta. He determined to do so
      at once, and obtain the required permission by word of mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was greatly surprised, when the front of the house appeared in view on
      this spring afternoon, to see what a white and sightless aspect pervaded
      all the windows. He came close: the eyeball blankness was caused by all
      the shutters and blinds being shut tight from top to bottom. Possibly this
      had been the case for some time-he could not tell. In one of the windows
      was a card bearing the announcement, 'This House to be let Furnished.'
      Here was a merciless clash between fancy and fact. Regretting now his
      faint-heartedness in not letting her know beforehand by some means that he
      was about to make a new start in the world, and coming to dwell near her,
      Christopher rang the bell to make inquiries. A gloomy caretaker appeared
      after a while, and the young man asked whither the ladies had gone to
      live. He was beyond measure depressed to learn that they were in the South
      of France-Arles, the man thought the place was called-the time of their
      return to town being very uncertain; though one thing was clear, they
      meant to miss the forthcoming London season altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Christopher's hope to see her again had brought a resolve to do so, so
      now resolve led to dogged patience. Instead of attempting anything by
      letter, he decided to wait; and he waited well, occupying himself in
      publishing a 'March' and a 'Morning and Evening Service in E flat.' Some
      four-part songs, too, engaged his attention when the heavier duties of the
      day were over-these duties being the giving of lessons in harmony and
      counterpoint, in which he was aided by the introductions of a man well
      known in the musical world, who had been acquainted with young Julian as a
      promising amateur long before he adopted music as the staff of his
      pilgrimage.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the end of summer when he again tried his fortune at the house in
      Exonbury Crescent. Scarcely calculating upon finding her at this stagnant
      time of the town year, and only hoping for information, Julian was
      surprised and excited to see the shutters open, and the house wearing
      altogether a living look, its neighbours having decidedly died off
      meanwhile.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The family here,' said a footman in answer to his inquiry, 'are only
      temporary tenants of the house. It is not Lady Petherwin's people.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you know the Petherwins' present address?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Underground, sir, for the old lady. She died some time ago in
      Switzerland, and was buried there, I believe.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And Mrs. Petherwin-the young lady,' said Christopher, starting.
    </p>
    <p>
      'We are not acquainted personally with the family,' the man replied. 'My
      master has only taken the house for a few months, whilst extensive
      alterations are being made in his own on the other side of the park, which
      he goes to look after every day. If you want any further information about
      Lady Petherwin, Mrs. Petherwin will probably give it. I can let you have
      her address.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, yes; thank you,' said Christopher.
    </p>
    <p>
      The footman handed him one of some cards which appeared to have been left
      for the purpose. Julian, though tremblingly anxious to know where
      Ethelberta was, did not look at it till he could take a cool survey in
      private. The address was 'Arrowthorne Lodge, Upper Wessex.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dear me!' said Christopher to himself, 'not far from Melchester; and not
      dreadfully far from Sandbourne.'

    <h2>
      12. ARROWTHORNE PARK AND LODGE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Summer was just over when Christopher Julian found himself rattling along
      in the train to Sandbourne on some trifling business appertaining to his
      late father's affairs, which would afford him an excuse for calling at
      Arrowthorne about the song of hers that he wished to produce. He alighted
      in the afternoon at a little station some twenty miles short of
      Sandbourne, and leaving his portmanteau behind him there, decided to walk
      across the fields, obtain if possible the interview with the lady, and
      return then to the station to finish the journey to Sandbourne, which he
      could thus reach at a convenient hour in the evening, and, if he chose,
      take leave of again the next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an afternoon which had a fungous smell out of doors, all being
      sunless and stagnant overhead and around. The various species of trees had
      begun to assume the more distinctive colours of their decline, and where
      there had been one pervasive green were now twenty greenish yellows, the
      air in the vistas between them being half opaque with blue exhalation.
      Christopher in his walk overtook a countryman, and inquired if the path
      they were following would lead him to Arrowthorne Lodge.
    </p>
    <p>
      ''Twill take 'ee into Arr'thorne Park,' the man replied. 'But you won't
      come anigh the Lodge, unless you bear round to the left as might be.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mrs. Petherwin lives there, I believe?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, sir. Leastwise unless she's but lately come. I have never heard of
      such a woman.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She may possibly be only visiting there.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, perhaps that's the shape o't. Well, now you tell o't, I have seen a
      strange face thereabouts once or twice lately. A young good-looking maid
      enough, seemingly.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, she's considered a very handsome lady.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I've heard the woodmen say, now that you tell o't, that they meet her
      every now and then, just at the closing in of the day, as they come home
      along with their nitches of sticks; ay, stalking about under the trees by
      herself-a tall black martel, so long-legged and awful-like that you'd
      think 'twas the old feller himself a-coming, they say. Now a woman must be
      a queer body to my thinking, to roam about by night so lonesome and that?
      Ay, now that you tell o't, there is such a woman, but 'a never have showed
      in the parish; sure I never thought who the body was-no, not once about
      her, nor where 'a was living and that-not I, till you spoke. Well, there,
      sir, that's Arr'thorne Lodge; do you see they three elms?' He pointed
      across the glade towards some confused foliage a long way off.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am not sure about the sort of tree you mean,' said Christopher, 'I see
      a number of trees with edges shaped like edges of clouds.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ay, ay, they be oaks; I mean the elms to the left hand.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But a man can hardly tell oaks from elms at that distance, my good
      fellow!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That 'a can very well-leastwise, if he's got the sense.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I think I see what you mean,' said Christopher. 'What next?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'When you get there, you bear away smart to nor'-west, and you'll come
      straight as a line to the Lodge.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How the deuce am I to know which is north-west in a strange place, with
      no sun to tell me?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What, not know nor-west? Well, I should think a boy could never live and
      grow up to be a man without knowing the four quarters. I knowed 'em when I
      was a mossel of a chiel. We be no great scholars here, that's true, but
      there isn't a Tom-rig or Jack-straw in these parts that don't know where
      they lie as well as I. Now I've lived, man and boy, these eight-and-sixty
      years, and never met a man in my life afore who hadn't learnt such a
      common thing as the four quarters.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher parted from his companion and soon reached a stile, clambering
      over which he entered a park. Here he threaded his way, and rounding a
      clump of aged trees the young man came in view of a light and elegant
      country-house in the half-timbered Gothic style of the late revival,
      apparently only a few years old. Surprised at finding himself so near,
      Christopher's heart fluttered unmanageably till he had taken an abstract
      view of his position, and, in impatience at his want of nerve, adopted a
      sombre train of reasoning to convince himself that, far from indulgence in
      the passion of love bringing bliss, it was a folly, leading to grief and
      disquiet-certainly one which would do him no good. Cooled down by this, he
      stepped into the drive and went up to the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is Mrs. Petherwin at home?' he said modestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who did you say, sir?'
    </p>
    <p>
      He repeated the name.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't know the person.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The lady may be a visitor-I call on business.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She is not visiting in this house, sir.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is not this Arrowthorne Lodge?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Certainly not.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then where is Arrowthorne Lodge, please?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, it is nearly a mile from here. Under the trees by the high-road. If
      you go across by that footpath it will bring you out quicker than by
      following the bend of the drive.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher wondered how he could have managed to get into the wrong park;
      but, setting it down to his ignorance of the difference between oak and
      elm, he immediately retraced his steps, passing across the park again,
      through the gate at the end of the drive, and into the turnpike road. No
      other gate, park, or country seat of any description was within view.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Can you tell me the way to Arrowthorne Lodge?' he inquired of the first
      person he met, who was a little girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are just coming away from it, sir,' said she. 'I'll show you; I am
      going that way.'
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked along together. Getting abreast the entrance of the park he
      had just emerged from, the child said, 'There it is, sir; I live there
      too.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher, with a dazed countenance, looked towards a cottage which
      stood nestling in the shrubbery and ivy like a mushroom among grass. 'Is
      that Arrowthorne Lodge?' he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, and if you go up the drive, you come to Arrowthorne House.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Arrowthorne Lodge-where Mrs. Petherwin lives, I mean.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. She lives there along wi' mother and we. But she don't want anybody
      to know it, sir, cause she's celebrate, and 'twouldn't do at all.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher said no more, and the little girl became interested in the
      products of the bank and ditch by the wayside. He left her, pushed open
      the heavy gate, and tapped at the Lodge door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latch was lifted. 'Does Mrs. Petherwin,' he began, and, determined
      that there should be no mistake, repeated, 'Does Mrs. Ethelberta
      Petherwin, the poetess, live here?' turning full upon the person who
      opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      'She does, sir,' said a faltering voice; and he found himself face to face
      with the pupil-teacher of Sandbourne.

    <h2>
      13. THE LODGE (continued)-THE COPSE BEHIND
    </h2>
    <p>
      'This is indeed a surprise; I-am glad to see you!' Christopher stammered,
      with a wire-drawn, radically different smile from the one he had
      intended-a smile not without a tinge of ghastliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes-I am home for the holidays,' said the blushing maiden; and, after a
      critical pause, she added, 'If you wish to speak to my sister, she is in
      the plantation with the children.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no-no, thank you-not necessary at all,' said Christopher, in haste. 'I
      only wish for an interview with a lady called Mrs. Petherwin.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes; Mrs Petherwin-my sister,' said Picotee. 'She is in the plantation.
      That little path will take you to her in five minutes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The amazed Christopher persuaded himself that this discovery was very
      delightful, and went on persuading so long that at last he felt it to be
      so. Unable, like many other people, to enjoy being satirized in words
      because of the irritation it caused him as aimed-at victim, he sometimes
      had philosophy enough to appreciate a satire of circumstance, because
      nobody intended it. Pursuing the path indicated, he found himself in a
      thicket of scrubby undergrowth, which covered an area enclosed from the
      park proper by a decaying fence. The boughs were so tangled that he was
      obliged to screen his face with his hands, to escape the risk of having
      his eyes filliped out by the twigs that impeded his progress. Thus slowly
      advancing, his ear caught, between the rustles, the tones of a voice in
      earnest declamation; and, pushing round in that direction, he beheld
      through some beech boughs an open space about ten yards in diameter,
      floored at the bottom with deep beds of curled old leaves, and cushions of
      furry moss. In the middle of this natural theatre was the stump of a tree
      that had been felled by a saw, and upon the flat stool thus formed stood
      Ethelberta, whom Christopher had not beheld since the ball at Wyndway
      House.
    </p>
    <p>
      Round her, leaning against branches or prostrate on the ground, were five
      or six individuals. Two were young mechanics-one of them evidently a
      carpenter. Then there was a boy about thirteen, and two or three younger
      children. Ethelberta's appearance answered as fully as ever to that of an
      English lady skilfully perfected in manner, carriage, look, and accent;
      and the incongruity of her present position among lives which had had many
      of Nature's beauties stamped out of them, and few of the beauties of Art
      stamped in, brought him, as a second feeling, a pride in her that almost
      equalled his first sentiment of surprise. Christopher's attention was
      meanwhile attracted from the constitution of the group to the words of the
      speaker in the centre of it-words to which her auditors were listening
      with still attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      It appeared to Christopher that Ethelberta had lately been undergoing some
      very extraordinary experiences. What the beginning of them had been he
      could not in the least understand, but the portion she was describing came
      distinctly to his ears, and he wondered more and more.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He came forward till he, like myself, was about twenty yards from the
      edge. I instinctively grasped my useless stiletto. How I longed for the
      assistance which a little earlier I had so much despised! Reaching the
      block or boulder upon which I had been sitting, he clasped his arms around
      from behind; his hands closed upon the empty seat, and he jumped up with
      an oath. This method of attack told me a new thing with wretched
      distinctness; he had, as I suppose, discovered my sex, male attire was to
      serve my turn no longer. The next instant, indeed, made it clear, for he
      exclaimed, "You don't escape me, masquerading madam," or some such words,
      and came on. My only hope was that in his excitement he might forget to
      notice where the grass terminated near the edge of the cliff, though this
      could be easily felt by a careful walker: to make my own feeling more
      distinct on this point I hastily bared my feet.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The listeners moistened their lips, Ethelberta took breath, and then went
      on to describe the scene that ensued, 'A dreadful variation on the game of
      Blindman's buff,' being the words by which she characterized it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta's manner had become so impassioned at this point that the lips
      of her audience parted, the children clung to their elders, and
      Christopher could control himself no longer. He thrust aside the boughs,
      and broke in upon the group.
    </p>
    <p>
      'For Heaven's sake, Ethelberta,' he exclaimed with great excitement,
      'where did you meet with such a terrible experience as that?'
    </p>
    <p>
      The children shrieked, as if they thought that the interruption was in
      some way the catastrophe of the events in course of narration. Every one
      started up; the two young mechanics stared, and one of them inquired, in
      return, 'What's the matter, friend?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher had not yet made reply when Ethelberta stepped from her
      pedestal down upon the crackling carpet of deep leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr. Julian!' said she, in a serene voice, turning upon him eyes of such a
      disputable stage of colour, between brown and grey, as would have
      commended itself to a gallant duellist of the last century as a point on
      which it was absolutely necessary to take some friend's life or other. But
      the calmness was artificially done, and the astonishment that did not
      appear in Ethelberta's tones was expressed by her gaze. Christopher was
      not in a mood to draw fine distinctions between recognized and
      unrecognized organs of speech. He replied to the eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I own that your surprise is natural,' he said, with an anxious look into
      her face, as if he wished to get beyond this interpolated scene to
      something more congenial and understood. 'But my concern at such a history
      of yourself since I last saw you is even more natural than your surprise
      at my manner of breaking in.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That history would justify any conduct in one who hears it-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, indeed.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If it were true,' added Ethelberta, smiling. 'But it is as false as-' She
      could name nothing notoriously false without raising an image of what was
      disagreeable, and she continued in a better manner: 'The story I was
      telling is entirely a fiction, which I am getting up for a particular
      purpose-very different from what appears at present.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am sorry there was such a misunderstanding,' Christopher stammered,
      looking upon the ground uncertain and ashamed. 'Yet I am not, either, for
      I am very glad you have not undergone such trials, of course. But the fact
      is, I-being in the neighbourhood-I ventured to call on a matter of
      business, relating to a poem which I had the pleasure of setting to music
      at the beginning of the year.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta was only a little less ill at ease than Christopher showed
      himself to be by this way of talking.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Will you walk slowly on?' she said gently to the two young men, 'and take
      the children with you; this gentleman wishes to speak to me on business.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The biggest young man caught up a little one under his arm, and plunged
      amid the boughs; another little one lingered behind for a few moments to
      look shyly at Christopher, with an oblique manner of hiding her mouth
      against her shoulder and her eyes behind her pinafore. Then she vanished,
      the boy and the second young man followed, and Ethelberta and Christopher
      stood within the wood-bound circle alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I hope I have caused no inconvenience by interrupting the proceedings,'
      said Christopher softly; 'but I so very much wished to see you!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Did you, indeed-really wish to see me?' she said gladly. 'Never mind
      inconvenience then; it is a word which seems shallow in meaning under the
      circumstances. I surely must say that a visit is to my advantage, must I
      not? I am not as I was, you see, and may receive as advantages what I used
      to consider as troubles.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Has your life really changed so much?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It has changed. But what I first meant was that an interesting visitor at
      a wrong time is better than a stupid one at a right time.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I had been behind the trees for some minutes, looking at you, and
      thinking of you; but what you were doing rather interrupted my first
      meditation. I had thought of a meeting in which we should continue our
      intercourse at the point at which it was broken off years ago, as if the
      omitted part had not existed at all; but something, I cannot tell what,
      has upset all that feeling, and-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I can soon tell you the meaning of my extraordinary performance,'
      Ethelberta broke in quickly, and with a little trepidation. 'My
      mother-in-law, Lady Petherwin, is dead; and she has left me nothing but
      her house and furniture in London-more than I deserve, but less than she
      had distinctly led me to expect; and so I am somewhat in a corner.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is always so.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not always, I think. But this is how it happened. Lady Petherwin was very
      capricious; when she was not foolishly kind she was unjustly harsh. A
      great many are like it, never thinking what a good thing it would be,
      instead of going on tacking from side to side between favour and cruelty,
      to keep to a mean line of common justice. And so we quarrelled, and she,
      being absolute mistress of all her wealth, destroyed her will that was in
      my favour, and made another, leaving me nothing but the fag-end of the
      lease of the town-house and the furniture in it. Then, when we were
      abroad, she turned to me again, forgave everything, and, becoming ill
      afterwards, wrote a letter to the brother, to whom she had left the bulk
      of her property, stating that I was to have twenty-thousand of the
      one-hundred-thousand pounds she had bequeathed to him-as in the original
      will-doing this by letter in case anything should happen to her before a
      new will could be considered, drawn, and signed, and trusting to his
      honour quite that he would obey her expressed wish should she die abroad.
      Well, she did die, in the full persuasion that I was provided for; but her
      brother (as I secretly expected all the time) refused to be morally bound
      by a document which had no legal value, and the result is that he has
      everything, except, of course, the furniture and the lease. It would have
      been enough to break the heart of a person who had calculated upon getting
      a fortune, which I never did; for I felt always like an intruder and a
      bondswoman, and had wished myself out of the Petherwin family a hundred
      times, with my crust of bread and liberty. For one thing, I was always
      forbidden to see my relatives, and it pained me much. Now I am going to
      move for myself, and consider that I have a good chance of success in what
      I may undertake, because of an indifference I feel about succeeding which
      gives the necessary coolness that any great task requires.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I presume you mean to write more poems?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I cannot-that is, I can write no more that satisfy me. To blossom into
      rhyme on the sparkling pleasures of life, you must be under the influence
      of those pleasures, and I am at present quite removed from them-surrounded
      by gaunt realities of a very different description.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then try the mournful. Trade upon your sufferings: many do, and thrive.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is no use to say that-no use at all. I cannot write a line of verse.
      And yet the others flowed from my heart like a stream. But nothing is so
      easy as to seem clever when you have money.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Except to seem stupid when you have none,' said Christopher, looking at
      the dead leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta allowed herself to linger on that thought for a few seconds;
      and continued, 'Then the question arose, what was I to do? I felt that to
      write prose would be an uncongenial occupation, and altogether a poor
      prospect for a woman like me. Finally I have decided to appear in public.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not on the stage?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Certainly not on the stage. There is no novelty in a poor lady turning
      actress, and novelty is what I want. Ordinary powers exhibited in a new
      way effect as much as extraordinary powers exhibited in an old way.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes-so they do. And extraordinary powers, and a new way too, would be
      irresistible.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't calculate upon both. I had written a prose story by request, when
      it was found that I had grown utterly inane over verse. It was written in
      the first person, and the style was modelled after De Foe's. The night
      before sending it off, when I had already packed it up, I was reading
      about the professional story-tellers of Eastern countries, who devoted
      their lives to the telling of tales. I unfastened the manuscript and
      retained it, convinced that I should do better by telling the story.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well thought of!' exclaimed Christopher, looking into her face. 'There is
      a way for everybody to live, if they can only find it out.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It occurred to me,' she continued, blushing slightly, 'that tales of the
      weird kind were made to be told, not written. The action of a teller is
      wanted to give due effect to all stories of incident; and I hope that a
      time will come when, as of old, instead of an unsocial reading of fiction
      at home alone, people will meet together cordially, and sit at the feet of
      a professed romancer. I am going to tell my tales before a London public.
      As a child, I had a considerable power in arresting the attention of other
      children by recounting adventures which had never happened; and men and
      women are but children enlarged a little. Look at this.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew from her pocket a folded paper, shook it abroad, and disclosed a
      rough draft of an announcement to the effect that Mrs. Petherwin,
      Professed Story-teller, would devote an evening to that ancient form of
      the romancer's art, at a well-known fashionable hall in London. 'Now you
      see,' she continued, 'the meaning of what you observed going on here. That
      you heard was one of three tales I am preparing, with a view of selecting
      the best. As a reserved one, I have the tale of my own life-to be played
      as a last card. It was a private rehearsal before my brothers and
      sisters-not with any view of obtaining their criticism, but that I might
      become accustomed to my own voice in the presence of listeners.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If I only had had half your enterprise, what I might have done in the
      world!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now did you ever consider what a power De Foe's manner would have if
      practised by word of mouth? Indeed, it is a style which suits itself
      infinitely better to telling than to writing, abounding as it does in
      colloquialisms that are somewhat out of place on paper in these days, but
      have a wonderful power in making a narrative seem real. And so, in short,
      I am going to talk De Foe on a subject of my own. Well?'
    </p>
    <p>
      The last word had been given tenderly, with a long-drawn sweetness, and
      was caused by a look that Christopher was bending upon her at the moment,
      in which he revealed that he was thinking less of the subject she was so
      eagerly and hopefully descanting upon than upon her aspect in explaining
      it. It is a fault of manner particularly common among men newly imported
      into the society of bright and beautiful women; and we will hope that,
      springing as it does from no unworthy source, it is as soon forgiven in
      the general world as it was here.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I was only following a thought,' said Christopher:-'a thought of how I
      used to know you, and then lost sight of you, and then discovered you
      famous, and how we are here under these sad autumn trees, and nobody in
      sight.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I think it must be tea-time,' she said suddenly. 'Tea is a great meal
      with us here-you will join us, will you not?' And Ethelberta began to make
      for herself a passage through the boughs. Another rustle was heard a
      little way off, and one of the children appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Emmeline wants to know, please, if the gentleman that come to see 'ee
      will stay to tea; because, if so, she's agoing to put in another spoonful
      for him and a bit of best green.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O Georgina-how candid! Yes, put in some best green.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Christopher could say any more to her, they were emerging by the
      corner of the cottage, and one of the brothers drew near them. 'Mr.
      Julian, you'll bide and have a cup of tea wi' us?' he inquired of
      Christopher. 'An old friend of yours, is he not, Mrs. Petherwin? Dan and I
      be going back to Sandbourne to-night, and we can walk with 'ee as far as
      the station.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I shall be delighted,' said Christopher; and they all entered the
      cottage. The evening had grown clearer by this time; the sun was peeping
      out just previous to departure, and sent gold wires of light across the
      glades and into the windows, throwing a pattern of the diamond quarries,
      and outlines of the geraniums in pots, against the opposite wall. One end
      of the room was polygonal, such a shape being dictated by the exterior
      design; in this part the windows were placed, as at the east end of
      continental churches. Thus, from the combined effects of the
      ecclesiastical lancet lights and the apsidal shape of the room, it
      occurred to Christopher that the sisters were all a delightful set of
      pretty saints, exhibiting themselves in a lady chapel, and backed up by
      unkempt major prophets, as represented by the forms of their big brothers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher sat down to tea as invited, squeezing himself in between two
      children whose names were almost as long as their persons, and whose tin
      cups discoursed primitive music by means of spoons rattled inside them
      until they were filled. The tea proceeded pleasantly, notwithstanding that
      the cake, being a little burnt, tasted on the outside like the latter
      plums in snapdragon. Christopher never could meet the eye of Picotee, who
      continued in a wild state of flushing all the time, fixing her looks upon
      the sugar-basin, except when she glanced out of the window to see how the
      evening was going on, and speaking no word at all unless it was to correct
      a small sister of somewhat crude manners as regards filling the mouth,
      which Picotee did in a whisper, and a gentle inclination of her mouth to
      the little one's ear, and a still deeper blush than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their visitor next noticed that an additional cup-and-saucer and plate
      made their appearance occasionally at the table, were silently
      replenished, and then carried off by one of the children to an inner
      apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Our mother is bedridden,' said Ethelberta, noticing Christopher's look at
      the proceeding. 'Emmeline attends to the household, except when Picotee is
      at home, and Joey attends to the gate; but our mother's affliction is a
      very unfortunate thing for the poor children. We are thinking of a plan of
      living which will, I hope, be more convenient than this is; but we have
      not yet decided what to do.' At this minute a carriage and pair of horses
      became visible through one of the angular windows of the apse, in the act
      of turning in from the highway towards the park gate. The boy who answered
      to the name of Joey sprang up from the table with the promptness of a
      Jack-in-the-box, and ran out at the door. Everybody turned as the carriage
      passed through the gate, which Joey held open, putting his other hand
      where the brim of his hat would have been if he had worn one, and lapsing
      into a careless boy again the instant that the vehicle had gone by.
    </p>
    <p>
      'There's a tremendous large dinner-party at the House to-night,' said
      Emmeline methodically, looking at the equipage over the edge of her
      teacup, without leaving off sipping. 'That was Lord Mountclere. He's a
      wicked old man, they say.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lord Mountclere?' said Ethelberta musingly. 'I used to know some friends
      of his. In what way is he wicked?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't know,' said Emmeline, with simplicity. 'I suppose it is because
      he breaks the commandments. But I wonder how a big rich lord can want to
      steal anything.' Emmeline's thoughts of breaking commandments
      instinctively fell upon the eighth, as being in her ideas the only case
      wherein the gain could be considered as at all worth the hazard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta said nothing; but Christopher thought that a shade of
      depression passed over her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hook back the gate, Joey,' shouted Emmeline, when the carriage had
      proceeded up the drive. 'There's more to come.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Joey did as ordered, and by the time he got indoors another carriage
      turned in from the public road-a one-horse brougham this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I know who that is: that's Mr. Ladywell,' said Emmeline, in the same
      matter-of-fact tone. 'He's been here afore: he's a distant relation of the
      squire's, and he once gave me sixpence for picking up his gloves.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What shall I live to see?' murmured the poetess, under her breath, nearly
      dropping her teacup in an involuntary trepidation, from which she made it
      a point of dignity to recover in a moment. Christopher's eyes, at that
      exhibition from Ethelberta, entered her own like a pair of lances.
      Picotee, seeing Christopher's quick look of jealousy, became involved in
      her turn, and grew pale as a lily in her endeavours to conceal the
      complications to which it gave birth in her poor little breast likewise.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You judge me very wrongly,' said Ethelberta, in answer to Christopher's
      hasty look of resentment.
    </p>
    <p>
      'In supposing Mr. Ladywell to be a great friend of yours?' said
      Christopher, who had in some indescribable way suddenly assumed a right to
      Ethelberta as his old property.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes: for I hardly know him, and certainly do not value him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      After this there was something in the mutual look of the two, though their
      words had been private, which did not tend to remove the anguish of
      fragile Picotee. Christopher, assured that Ethelberta's embarrassment had
      been caused by nothing more than the sense of her odd social subsidence,
      recovered more bliss than he had lost, and regarded calmly the profile of
      young Ladywell between the two windows of his brougham as it passed the
      open cottage door, bearing him along unconscious as the dead of the
      nearness of his beloved one, and of the sad buffoonery that fate, fortune,
      and the guardian angels had been playing with Ethelberta of late. He
      recognized the face as that of the young man whom he had encountered when
      watching Ethelberta's window from Rookington Park.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Perhaps you remember seeing him at the Christmas dance at Wyndway?' she
      inquired. 'He is a good-natured fellow. Afterwards he sent me that
      portfolio of sketches you see in the corner. He might possibly do
      something in the world as a painter if he were obliged to work at the art
      for his bread, which he is not.' She added with bitter pleasantry: 'In
      bare mercy to his self-respect I must remain unseen here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      It impressed Christopher to perceive how, under the estrangement which
      arose from differences of education, surroundings, experience, and talent,
      the sympathies of close relationship were perceptible in Ethelberta's
      bearing towards her brothers and sisters. At a remark upon some simple
      pleasure wherein she had not participated because absent and occupied by
      far more comprehensive interests, a gloom as of banishment would cross her
      face and dim it for awhile, showing that the free habits and enthusiasms
      of country life had still their charm with her, in the face of the subtler
      gratifications of abridged bodices, candlelight, and no feelings in
      particular, which prevailed in town. Perhaps the one condition which could
      work up into a permanent feeling the passing revival of his fancy for a
      woman whose chief attribute he had supposed to be sprightliness was added
      now by the romantic ubiquity of station that attached to her. A discovery
      which might have grated on the senses of a man wedded to conventionality
      was a positive pleasure to one whose faith in society had departed with
      his own social ruin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room began to darken, whereupon Christopher arose to leave; and the
      brothers Sol and Dan offered to accompany him.

      'We be thinking of coming to London ourselves soon,' said Sol, a carpenter
      and joiner by trade, as he walked along at Christopher's left hand.
      'There's so much more chance for a man up the country. Now, if you was me,
      how should you set about getting a job, sir?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What can you do?' said Christopher.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I am a very good staircase hand; and I have been called neat at
      sash-frames; and I can knock together doors and shutters very well; and I
      can do a little at the cabinet-making. I don't mind framing a roof,

      'You can both do too much to stand the least chance of being allowed to do
      anything in a city, where limitation is all the rule in labour. To have
      any success, Sol, you must be a man who can thoroughly look at a door to
      see what ought to be done to it, but as to looking at a window, that's not
      your line; or a person who, to the remotest particular, understands
      turning a screw, but who does not profess any knowledge of how to drive a
      nail. Dan must know how to paint blue to a marvel, but must be quite in
      the dark about painting green. If you stick to some such principle of
      specialty as this, you may get employment in London.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ha-ha-ha!' said Dan, striking at a stone in the road with the stout green
      hazel he carried. 'A wink is as good as a nod: thank'ee-we'll mind all
      that now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If we do come,' said Sol, 'we shall not mix up with Mrs. Petherwin at
      all.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O indeed!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no. (Perhaps you think it odd that we call her "Mrs. Petherwin," but
      that's by agreement as safer and better than Berta, because we be such
      rough chaps you see, and she's so lofty.) 'Twould demean her to claim kin
      wi' her in London-two journeymen like we, that know nothing besides our
      trades.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not at all,' said Christopher, by way of chiming in in the friendliest
      manner. 'She would be pleased to see any straightforward honest man and
      brother, I should think, notwithstanding that she has moved in other
      society for a time.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, you don't know Berta!' said Dan, looking as if he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How-in what way do you mean?' said Christopher uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      'So lofty-so very lofty! Isn't she, Sol? Why she'll never stir out from
      mother's till after dark, and then her day begins; and she'll traipse
      about under the trees, and never go into the high-road, so that nobody in
      the way of gentle-people shall run up against her and know her living in
      such a little small hut after biding in a big mansion-place. There, we
      don't find fault wi' her about it: we like her just the same, though she
      don't speak to us in the street; for a feller must be a fool to make a
      piece of work about a woman's pride, when 'tis his own sister, and hang
      upon her and bother her when he knows 'tis for her good that he should
      not. Yes, her life has been quare enough. I hope she enjoys it, but for my
      part I like plain sailing. None of your ups and downs for me. There, I
      suppose 'twas her nater to want to look into the world a bit.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Father and mother kept Berta to school, you understand, sir,' explained
      the more thoughtful Sol, 'because she was such a quick child, and they
      always had a notion of making a governess of her. Sums? If you said to
      that child, "Berta, 'levenpence-three-farthings a day, how much a year?"
      she would tell 'ee in three seconds out of her own little head. And that
      hard sum about the herrings she had done afore she was nine.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'True, she had,' said Dan. 'And we all know that to do that is to do
      something that's no nonsense.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What is the sum?' Christopher inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What-not know the sum about the herrings?' said Dan, spreading his gaze
      all over Christopher in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never heard of it,' said Christopher.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why down in these parts just as you try a man's soul by the Ten
      Commandments, you try his head by that there sum-hey, Sol?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ay, that we do.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A herring and a half for three-halfpence, how many can ye get for
      'levenpence: that's the feller; and a mortal teaser he is, I assure 'ee.
      Our parson, who's not altogether without sense o' week days, said one
      afternoon, "If cunning can be found in the multiplication table at all,
      Chickerel, 'tis in connection with that sum." Well, Berta was so clever in
      arithmetic that she was asked to teach summing at Miss Courtley's, and
      there she got to like foreign tongues more than ciphering, and at last she
      hated ciphering, and took to books entirely. Mother and we were very proud
      of her at that time: not that we be stuck-up people at all-be we, Sol?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not at all; nobody can say that we be that, though there's more of it in
      the country than there should be by all account.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You'd be surprised to see how vain the girls about here be getting.
      Little rascals, why they won't curtsey to the loftiest lady in the land;
      no, not if you were to pay 'em to do it. Now, the men be different. Any
      man will touch his hat for a pint of beer. But then, of course, there's
      some difference between the two. Touching your hat is a good deal less to
      do than bending your knees, as Berta used to say, when she was blowed up
      for not doing it. She was always one of the independent sort-you never
      seed such a maid as she was! Now, Picotee was quite the other way.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Has Picotee left Sandbourne entirely?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no; she is home for the holidays. Well, Mr. Julian, our road parts from
      yours just here, unless you walk into the next town along with us. But I
      suppose you get across to this station and go by rail?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am obliged to go that way for my portmanteau,' said Christopher, 'or I
      should have been pleased to walk further. Shall I see you in Sandbourne
      to-morrow? I hope so.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, no. 'Tis hardly likely that you will see us-hardly. We know how
      unpleasant it is for a high sort of man to have rough chaps like us
      hailing him, so we think it best not to meet you-thank you all the same.
      So if you should run up against us in the street, we should be just as
      well pleased by your taking no notice, if you wouldn't mind. 'Twill save
      so much awkwardness-being in our working clothes. 'Tis always the plan
      that Mrs. Petherwin and we agree to act upon, and we find it best for
      both. I hope you take our meaning right, and as no offence, Mr. Julian.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And do you do the same with Picotee?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O Lord, no-'tisn't a bit of use to try. That's the worst of
      Picotee-there's no getting rid of her. The more in the rough we be the
      more she'll stick to us; and if we say she shan't come, she'll bide and
      fret about it till we be forced to let her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher laughed, and promised, on condition that they would retract
      the statement about their not being proud; and then he wished his friends
      good-night.

    <h2>
      15. AN INNER ROOM AT THE LODGE
    </h2>
    <p>
      At the Lodge at this time a discussion of some importance was in progress.
      The scene was Mrs. Chickerel's bedroom, to which, unfortunately, she was
      confined by some spinal complaint; and here she now appeared as an
      interesting woman of five-and-forty, properly dressed as far as visible,
      and propped up in a bed covered with a quilt which presented a field of
      little squares in many tints, looking altogether like a bird's-eye view of
      a market garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Chickerel had been nurse in a nobleman's family until her marriage,
      and after that she played the part of wife and mother, upon the whole,
      affectionately and well. Among her minor differences with her husband had
      been one about the naming of the children; a matter that was at last
      compromised by an agreement under which the choice of the girls' names
      became her prerogative, and that of the boys' her husband's, who limited
      his field of selection to strict historical precedent as a set-off to Mrs.
      Chickerel's tendency to stray into the regions of romance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only grown-up daughters at home, Ethelberta and Picotee, with their
      brother Joey, were sitting near her; the two youngest children, Georgina
      and Myrtle, who had been strutting in and out of the room, and otherwise
      endeavouring to walk, talk, and speak like the gentleman just gone away,
      were packed off to bed. Emmeline, of that transitional age which causes
      its exponent to look wistfully at the sitters when romping and at the
      rompers when sitting, uncertain whether her position in the household is
      that of child or woman, was idling in a corner. The two absent brothers
      and two absent sisters-eldest members of the family-completed the round
      ten whom Mrs. Chickerel with thoughtless readiness had presented to a
      crowded world, to cost Ethelberta many wakeful hours at night while she
      revolved schemes how they might be decently maintained.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I still think,' Ethelberta was saying, 'that the plan I first proposed is
      the best. I am convinced that it will not do to attempt to keep on the
      Lodge. If we are all together in town, I can look after you much better
      than when you are far away from me down here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Shall we not interfere with you-your plans for keeping up your
      connections?' inquired her mother, glancing up towards Ethelberta by
      lifting the flesh of her forehead, instead of troubling to raise her face
      altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not nearly so much as by staying here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But,' said Picotee, 'if you let lodgings, won't the gentlemen and ladies
      know it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have thought of that,' said Ethelberta, 'and this is how I shall
      manage. In the first place, if mother is there, the lodgings can be let in
      her name, all bills will be receipted by her, and all tradesmen's orders
      will be given as from herself. Then, we will take no English lodgers at
      all; we will advertise the rooms only in Continental newspapers, as
      suitable for a French or German gentleman or two, and by this means there
      will be little danger of my acquaintance discovering that my house is not
      entirely a private one, or of any lodger being a friend of my
      acquaintance. I have thought over every possible way of combining the
      dignified social position I must maintain to make my story-telling
      attractive, with my absolute lack of money, and I can see no better one.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then if Gwendoline is to be your cook, she must soon give notice at her
      present place?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. Everything depends upon Gwendoline and Cornelia. But there is time
      enough for them to give notice-Christmas will be soon enough. If they
      cannot or will not come as cook and housemaid, I am afraid the plan will
      break down. A vital condition is that I do not have a soul in the house
      (beyond the lodgers) who is not one of my own relations. When we have put
      Joey into buttons, he will do very well to attend to the door.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But s'pose,' said Joey, after a glassy look at his future appearance in
      the position alluded to, 'that any of your gentle-people come to see ye,
      and when I opens the door and lets 'em in a swinging big lodger stalks
      downstairs. What will 'em think? Up will go their eye-glasses at one
      another till they glares each other into holes. My gracious!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The one who calls will only think that another visitor is leaving, Joey.
      But I shall have no visitors, or very few. I shall let it be well known
      among my late friends that my mother is an invalid, and that on this
      account we receive none but the most intimate friends. These intimate
      friends not existing, we receive nobody at all.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Except Sol and Dan, if they get a job in London? They'll have to call
      upon us at the back door, won't they, Berta?' said Joey.
    </p>
    <p>
      'They must go down the area steps. But they will not mind that; they like
      the idea.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And father, too, must he go down the steps?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He may come whichever way he likes. He will be glad enough to have us
      near at any price. I know that he is not at all happy at leaving you down
      here, and he away in London. You remember that he has only taken the
      situation at Mr. Doncastle's on the supposition that you all come to town
      as soon as he can see an opening for getting you there; and as nothing of
      the sort has offered itself to him, this will be the very thing. Of
      course, if I succeed wonderfully well in my schemes for story-tellings,
      readings of my ballads and poems, lectures on the art of versification,
      and what not, we need have no lodgers; and then we shall all be living a
      happy family-all taking our share in keeping the establishment going.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Except poor me!' sighed the mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My dear mother, you will be necessary as a steadying power-a flywheel, in
      short, to the concern. I wish that father could live there, too.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He'll never give up his present way of life-it has grown to be a part of
      his nature. Poor man, he never feels at home except in somebody else's
      house, and is nervous and quite a stranger in his own. Sich is the fatal
      effects of service!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O mother, don't!' said Ethelberta tenderly, but with her teeth on edge;
      and Picotee curled up her toes, fearing that her mother was going to
      moralize.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, what I mean is, that your father would not like to live upon your
      earnings, and so forth. But in town we shall be near him-that's one
      comfort, certainly.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And I shall not be wanted at all,' said Picotee, in a melancholy tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is much better to stay where you are,' her mother said. 'You will come
      and spend the holidays with us, of course, as you do now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I should like to live in London best,' murmured Picotee, her head sinking
      mournfully to one side. 'I HATE being in Sandbourne now!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nonsense!' said Ethelberta severely. 'We are all contriving how to live
      most comfortably, and it is by far the best thing for you to stay at the
      school. You used to be happy enough there.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Picotee sighed, and said no more.

    <h2>
      16. A LARGE PUBLIC HALL
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was the second week in February, Parliament had just met, and
      Ethelberta appeared for the first time before an audience in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was some novelty in the species of entertainment that the active
      young woman had proposed to herself, and this doubtless had due effect in
      collecting the body of strangers that greeted her entry, over and above
      those friends who came to listen to her as a matter of course. Men and
      women who had become totally indifferent to new actresses, new readers,
      and new singers, once more felt the freshness of curiosity as they
      considered the promise of the announcement. But the chief inducement to
      attend lay in the fact that here was to be seen in the flesh a woman with
      whom the tongue of rumour had been busy in many romantic ways-a woman who,
      whatever else might be doubted, had certainly produced a volume of verses
      which had been the talk of the many who had read them, and of the many
      more who had not, for several consecutive weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was her story to be? Persons interested in the inquiry-a small
      proportion, it may be owned, of the whole London public, and chiefly young
      men-answered this question for themselves by assuming that it would take
      the form of some pungent and gratifying revelation of the innermost events
      of her own life, from which her gushing lines had sprung as an inevitable
      consequence, and which being once known, would cause such musical poesy to
      appear no longer wonderful.
    </p>
    <p>
      The front part of the room was well filled, rows of listeners showing
      themselves like a drilled-in crop of which not a seed has failed. They
      were listeners of the right sort, a majority having noses of the prominent
      and dignified type, which when viewed in oblique perspective ranged as
      regularly as bow-windows at a watering place. Ethelberta's plan was to
      tell her pretended history and adventures while sitting in a chair-as if
      she were at her own fireside, surrounded by a circle of friends. By this
      touch of domesticity a great appearance of truth and naturalness was
      given, though really the attitude was at first more difficult to maintain
      satisfactorily than any one wherein stricter formality should be observed.
      She gently began her subject, as if scarcely knowing whether a throng were
      near her or not, and, in her fear of seeming artificial, spoke too low.
      This defect, however, she soon corrected, and ultimately went on in a
      charmingly colloquial manner. What Ethelberta relied upon soon became
      evident. It was not upon the intrinsic merits of her story as a piece of
      construction, but upon her method of telling it. Whatever defects the tale
      possessed-and they were not a few-it had, as delivered by her, the one
      pre-eminent merit of seeming like truth. A modern critic has well observed
      of De Foe that he had the most amazing talent on record for telling lies;
      and Ethelberta, in wishing her fiction to appear like a real narrative of
      personal adventure, did wisely to make De Foe her model. His is a style
      even better adapted for speaking than for writing, and the peculiarities
      of diction which he adopts to give verisimilitude to his narratives
      acquired enormous additional force when exhibited as viva-voce mannerisms.
      And although these artifices were not, perhaps, slavishly copied from that
      master of feigning, they would undoubtedly have reminded her hearers of
      him, had they not mostly been drawn from an easeful section in society
      which is especially characterized by the mental condition of knowing
      nothing about any author a week after they have read him. The few there
      who did remember De Foe were impressed by a fancy that his words greeted
      them anew in a winged auricular form, instead of by the weaker channels of
      print and eyesight. The reader may imagine what an effect this
      well-studied method must have produced when intensified by a clear, living
      voice, animated action, and the brilliant and expressive eye of a handsome
      woman-attributes which of themselves almost compelled belief. When she
      reached the most telling passages, instead of adding exaggerated action
      and sound, Ethelberta would lapse to a whisper and a sustained stillness,
      which were more striking than gesticulation. All that could be done by art
      was there, and if inspiration was wanting nobody missed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in performing this feat that Ethelberta seemed first to discover in
      herself the full power of that self-command which further onward in her
      career more and more impressed her as a singular possession, until at last
      she was tempted to make of it many fantastic uses, leading to results that
      affected more households than her own. A talent for demureness under
      difficulties without the cold-bloodedness which renders such a bearing
      natural and easy, a face and hand reigning unmoved outside a heart by
      nature turbulent as a wave, is a constitutional arrangement much to be
      desired by people in general; yet, had Ethelberta been framed with less of
      that gift in her, her life might have been more comfortable as an
      experience, and brighter as an example, though perhaps duller as a story.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ladywell, how came this Mrs. Petherwin to think of such a queer trick as
      telling romances, after doing so well as a poet?' said a man in the stalls
      to his friend, who had been gazing at the Story-teller with a rapt face.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What-don't you know?-everybody did, I thought,' said the painter.
    </p>
    <p>
      'A mistake. Indeed, I should not have come here at all had I not heard the
      subject mentioned by accident yesterday at Grey's; and then I remembered
      her to be the same woman I had met at some place-Belmaine's I think it
      was-last year, when I thought her just getting on for handsome and clever,
      not to put it too strongly.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah! naturally you would not know much,' replied Ladywell, in an eager
      whisper. 'Perhaps I am judging others by myself a little more than-but, as
      you have heard, she is an acquaintance of mine. I know her very well, and,
      in fact, I originally suggested the scheme to her as a pleasant way of
      adding to her fame. "Depend upon it, dear Mrs. Petherwin," I said, during
      a pause in one of our dances together some time ago, "any public
      appearance of yours would be successful beyond description."'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, I had no idea that you knew her so well! Then it is quite through you
      that she has adopted this course?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, not entirely-I could not say entirely. She said that some day,
      perhaps, she might do such a thing; and, in short, I reduced her vague
      ideas to form.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I should not mind knowing her better-I must get you to throw us together
      in some way,' said Neigh, with some interest. 'I had no idea that you were
      such an old friend. You could do it, I suppose?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Really, I am afraid-hah-hah-may not have the opportunity of obliging you.
      I met her at Wyndway, you know, where she was visiting with Lady
      Petherwin. It was some time ago, and I cannot say that I have ever met her
      since.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Or before?' said Neigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well-no; I never did.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ladywell, if I had half your power of going to your imagination for
      facts, I would be the greatest painter in England.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now Neigh-that's too bad-but with regard to this matter, I do speak with
      some interest,' said Ladywell, with a pleased sense of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      'In love with her?-Smitten down?-Done for?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now, now! However, several other fellows chaff me about her. It was only
      yesterday that Jones said-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you know why she cares to do this sort of thing?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Merely a desire for fame, I suppose.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I should think she has fame enough already.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That I can express no opinion upon. I am thinking of getting her
      permission to use her face in a subject I am preparing. It is a fine face
      for canvas. Glorious contour-glorious. Ah, here she is again, for the
      second part.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dream on, young fellow. You'll make a rare couple!' said Neigh, with a
      flavour of superciliousness unheeded by his occupied companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Further back in the room were a pair of faces whose keen interest in the
      performance contrasted much with the languidly permissive air of those in
      front. When the ten minutes' break occurred, Christopher was the first of
      the two to speak. 'Well, what do you think of her, Faith?' he said,
      shifting restlessly on his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I like the quiet parts of the tale best, I think,' replied the sister;
      'but, of course, I am not a good judge of these things. How still the
      people are at times! I continually take my eyes from her to look at the
      listeners. Did you notice the fat old lady in the second row, with her
      cloak a little thrown back? She was absolutely unconscious, and stayed
      with her face up and lips parted like a little child of six.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She well may! the thing is a triumph. That fellow Ladywell is here, I
      believe-yes, it is he, busily talking to the man on his right. If I were a
      woman I would rather go donkey-driving than stick myself up there, for
      gaping fops to quiz and say what they like about! But she had no choice,
      poor thing; for it was that or nothing with her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Faith, who had secret doubts about the absolute necessity of Ethelberta's
      appearance in public, said, with remote meanings, 'Perhaps it is not
      altogether a severe punishment to her to be looked at by well-dressed men.
      Suppose she feels it as a blessing, instead of an affliction?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She is a different sort of woman, Faith, and so you would say if you knew
      her. Of course, it is natural for you to criticize her severely just now,
      and I don't wish to defend her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I think you do a little, Kit.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No; I am indifferent about it all. Perhaps it would have been better for
      me if I had never seen her; and possibly it might have been better for her
      if she had never seen me. She has a heart, and the heart is a troublesome
      encumbrance when great things have to be done. I wish you knew her: I am
      sure you would like each other.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O yes,' said Faith, in a voice of rather weak conviction. 'But, as we
      live in such a plain way, it would be hardly desirable at present.'
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Ethelberta being regarded, in common with the latest conjurer,
      spirit-medium, aeronaut, giant, dwarf or monarch, as a new sensation, she
      was duly criticized in the morning papers, and even obtained a notice in
      some of the weekly reviews.
    </p>
    <p>
      'A handsome woman,' said one of these, 'may have her own reasons for
      causing the flesh of the London public to creep upon its bones by her
      undoubtedly remarkable narrative powers; but we question if much good can
      result from such a form of entertainment. Nevertheless, some praise is
      due. We have had the novel-writer among us for some time, and the
      novel-reader has occasionally appeared on our platforms; but we believe
      that this is the first instance on record of a Novel-teller-one, that is
      to say, who relates professedly as fiction a romantic tale which has never
      been printed-the whole owing its chief interest to the method whereby the
      teller identifies herself with the leading character in the story.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Another observed: 'When once we get away from the magic influence of the
      story-teller's eye and tongue, we perceive how improbable, even
      impossible, is the tissue of events to which we have been listening with
      so great a sense of reality, and we feel almost angry with ourselves at
      having been the victims of such utter illusion.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mrs. Petherwin's personal appearance is decidedly in her favour,' said
      another. 'She affects no unconsciousness of the fact that form and feature
      are no mean vehicles of persuasion, and she uses the powers of each to the
      utmost. There spreads upon her face when in repose an air of innocence
      which is charmingly belied by the subtlety we discover beneath it when she
      begins her tale; and this amusing discrepancy between her physical
      presentment and the inner woman is further illustrated by the misgiving,
      which seizes us on her entrance, that so impressionable a lady will never
      bear up in the face of so trying an audience. . . . The combinations of
      incident which Mrs. Petherwin persuades her hearers that she has passed
      through are not a little marvellous; and if what is rumoured be true, that
      the tales are to a great extent based upon her own experiences, she has
      proved herself to be no less daring in adventure than facile in her power
      of describing it.'

      17. ETHELBERTA'S HOUSE
    </h2>
    <p>
      After such successes as these, Christopher could not forego the seductive
      intention of calling upon the poetess and romancer, at her now established
      town residence in Exonbury Crescent. One wintry afternoon he reached the
      door-now for the third time-and gave a knock which had in it every tender
      refinement that could be thrown into the somewhat antagonistic vehicle of
      noise. Turning his face down the street he waited restlessly on the step.
      There was a strange light in the atmosphere: the glass of the
      street-lamps, the varnished back of a passing cab, a milk-woman's cans,
      and a row of church-windows glared in his eyes like new-rubbed copper; and
      on looking the other way he beheld a bloody sun hanging among the chimneys
      at the upper end, as a danger-lamp to warn him off.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time the door was opened, and before him stood Ethelberta's young
      brother Joey, thickly populated with little buttons, the remainder of him
      consisting of invisible green.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, Joseph,' said Christopher, instantly recognizing the boy. 'What, are
      you here in office? Is your-'
    </p>
    <p>
      Joey lifted his forefinger and spread his mouth in a genial manner, as if
      to signify particular friendliness mingled with general caution.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, sir, Mrs. Petherwin is my mistress. I'll see if she is at home,
      sir,' he replied, raising his shoulders and winking a wink of strategic
      meanings by way of finish-all which signs showed, if evidence were wanted,
      how effectually this pleasant young page understood, though quite fresh
      from Wessex, the duties of his peculiar position. Mr. Julian was shown to
      the drawing-room, and there he found Ethelberta alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave him a hand so cool and still that Christopher, much as he desired
      the contact, was literally ashamed to let her see and feel his own,
      trembling with unmanageable excess of feeling. It was always so, always
      had been so, always would be so, at these meetings of theirs: she was
      immeasurably the strongest; and the deep-eyed young man fancied, in the
      chagrin which the perception of this difference always bred in him, that
      she triumphed in her superior control. Yet it was only in little things
      that their sexes were thus reversed: Christopher would receive quite a
      shock if a little dog barked at his heels, and be totally unmoved when in
      danger of his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly the most self-possessed woman in the world, under pressure of
      the incongruity between their last meeting and the present one, might have
      shown more embarrassment than Ethelberta showed on greeting him to-day.
      Christopher was only a man in believing that the shyness which she did
      evince was chiefly the result of personal interest. She might or might not
      have been said to blush-perhaps the stealthy change upon her face was too
      slow an operation to deserve that name: but, though pale when he called,
      the end of ten minutes saw her colour high and wide. She soon set him at
      his ease, and seemed to relax a long-sustained tension as she talked to
      him of her arrangements, hopes, and fears.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And how do you like London society?' said Ethelberta.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Pretty well, as far as I have seen it: to the surface of its front door.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You will find nothing to be alarmed at if you get inside.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no-of course not-except my own shortcomings,' said the modest musician.
      'London society is made up of much more refined people than society
      anywhere else.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's a very prevalent opinion; and it is nowhere half so prevalent as
      in London society itself. However, come and see my house-unless you think
      it a trouble to look over a house?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No; I should like it very much.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The decorations tended towards the artistic gymnastics prevalent in some
      quarters at the present day. Upon a general flat tint of duck's-egg green
      appeared quaint patterns of conventional foliage, and birds, done in
      bright auburn, several shades nearer to redbreast-red than was
      Ethelberta's hair, which was thus thrust further towards brown by such
      juxtaposition-a possible reason for the choice of tint. Upon the glazed
      tiles within the chimney-piece were the forms of owls, bats, snakes,
      frogs, mice, spiders in their webs, moles, and other objects of aversion
      and darkness, shaped in black and burnt in after the approved fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My brothers Sol and Dan did most of the actual work,' said Ethelberta,
      'though I drew the outlines, and designed the tiles round the fire. The
      flowers, mice, and spiders are done very simply, you know: you only press
      a real flower, mouse, or spider out flat under a piece of glass, and then
      copy it, adding a little more emaciation and angularity at pleasure.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'In that "at pleasure" is where all the art lies,' said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, yes-that is the case,' said Ethelberta thoughtfully; and preceding
      him upstairs, she threw open a door on one of the floors, disclosing Dan
      in person, engaged upon a similar treatment of this floor also. Sol
      appeared bulging from the door of a closet, a little further on, where he
      was fixing some shelves; and both wore workmen's blouses. At once coming
      down from the short ladder he was standing upon, Dan shook Christopher's
      hand with some velocity.
    </p>
    <p>
      'We do a little at a time, you see,' he said, 'because Colonel down below,
      and Mrs. Petherwin's visitors, shan't smell the turpentine.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'We be pushing on to-day to get it out of the way,' said Sol, also coming
      forward and greeting their visitor, but more reluctantly than his brother
      had done. 'Now I'll tell ye what-you two,' he added, after an uneasy
      pause, turning from Christopher to Ethelberta and back again in great
      earnestness; 'you'd better not bide here, talking to we rough ones, you
      know, for folks might find out that there's something closer between us
      than workmen and employer and employer's friend. So Berta and Mr. Julian,
      if you'll go on and take no more notice o' us, in case of visitors, it
      would be wiser-else, perhaps, if we should be found out intimate with ye,
      and bring down your gentility, you'll blame us for it. I get as nervous as
      a cat when I think I may be the cause of any disgrace to ye.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't be so silly, Sol,' said Ethelberta, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, that's all very well,' said Sol, with an unbelieving smile; 'but if
      we bain't company for you out of doors, you bain't company for we
      within-not that I find fault with ye or mind it, and shan't take anything
      for painting your house, nor will Dan neither, any more for that-no, not a
      penny; in fact, we are glad to do it for 'ee. At the same time, you keep
      to your class, and we'll keep to ours. And so, good afternoon, Berta, when
      you like to go, and the same to you, Mr. Julian. Dan, is that your mind?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I can but own it,' said Dan.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two brothers then turned their backs upon their visitors, and went on
      working, and Ethelberta and her lover left the room. 'My brothers, you
      perceive,' said she, 'represent the respectable British workman in his
      entirety, and a touchy individual he is, I assure you, on points of
      dignity, after imbibing a few town ideas from his leaders. They are
      painfully off-hand with me, absolutely refusing to be intimate, from a
      mistaken notion that I am ashamed of their dress and manners; which, of
      course, is absurd.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Which, of course, is absurd,' said Christopher.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of course it is absurd!' she repeated with warmth, and looking keenly at
      him. But, finding no harm in his face, she continued as before: 'Yet, all
      the time, they will do anything under the sun that they think will advance
      my interests. In our hearts we are one. All they ask me to do is to leave
      them to themselves, and therefore I do so. Now, would you like to see some
      more of your acquaintance?'
    </p>
    <p>
      She introduced him to a large attic; where he found himself in the society
      of two or three persons considerably below the middle height, whose
      manners were of that gushing kind sometimes called Continental, their ages
      ranging from five years to eight. These were the youngest children,
      presided over by Emmeline, as professor of letters, capital and small.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am giving them the rudiments of education here,' said Ethelberta; 'but
      I foresee several difficulties in the way of keeping them here, which I
      must get over as best I can. One trouble is, that they don't get enough
      air and exercise.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is Mrs. Chickerel living here as well?' Christopher ventured to inquire,
      when they were downstairs again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes; but confined to her room as usual, I regret to say. Two more sisters
      of mine, whom you have never seen at all, are also here. They are older
      than any of the rest of us, and had, broadly speaking, no education at
      all, poor girls. The eldest, Gwendoline, is my cook, and Cornelia is my
      housemaid. I suffer much sadness, and almost misery sometimes, in
      reflecting that here are we, ten brothers and sisters, born of one father
      and mother, who might have mixed together and shared all in the same
      scenes, and been properly happy, if it were not for the strange accidents
      that have split us up into sections as you see, cutting me off from them
      without the compensation of joining me to any others. They are all true as
      steel in keeping the secret of our kin, certainly; but that brings little
      joy, though some satisfaction perhaps.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You might be less despondent, I think. The tale-telling has been one of
      the successes of the season.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, I might; but I may observe that you scarcely set the example of
      blitheness.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah-that's not because I don't recognize the pleasure of being here. It is
      from a more general cause: simply an underfeeling I have that at the most
      propitious moment the distance to the possibility of sorrow is so short
      that a man's spirits must not rise higher than mere cheerfulness out of
      bare respect to his insight.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       "As long as skies are blue, and fields are green,
       Evening must usher night, night urge the morrow,
    Month follow month with woe, and year wake year to sorrow."'
</pre>
    <p>
      Ethelberta bowed uncertainly; the remark might refer to her past conduct
      or it might not. 'My great cause of uneasiness is the children,' she
      presently said, as a new page of matter. 'It is my duty, at all risk and
      all sacrifice of sentiment, to educate and provide for them. The grown-up
      ones, older than myself, I cannot help much, but the little ones I can. I
      keep my two French lodgers for the sake of them.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The lodgers, of course, don't know the relationship between yourself and
      the rest of the people in the house?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no!-nor will they ever. My mother is supposed to let the ground and
      first floors to me-a strange lady-as she does the second and third floors
      to them. Still, I may be discovered.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well-if you are?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Let me be. Life is a battle, they say; but it is only so in the sense
      that a game of chess is a battle-there is no seriousness in it; it may be
      put an end to at any inconvenient moment by owning yourself beaten, with a
      careless "Ha-ha!" and sweeping your pieces into the box. Experimentally, I
      care to succeed in society; but at the bottom of my heart, I don't care.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'For that very reason you are likely to do it. My idea is, make ambition
      your business and indifference your relaxation, and you will fail; but
      make indifference your business and ambition your relaxation, and you will
      succeed. So impish are the ways of the gods.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I hope that you at any rate will succeed,' she said, at the end of a
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I never can-if success means getting what one wants.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why should you not get that?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It has been forbidden to me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Her complexion changed just enough to show that she knew what he meant.
      'If you were as bold as you are subtle, you would take a more cheerful
      view of the matter,' she said, with a look signifying innermost things.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will instantly! Shall I test the truth of my cheerful view by a word of
      question?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I deny that you are capable of taking that view, and until you prove that
      you are, no question is allowed,' she said, laughing, and still warmer in
      the face and neck. 'Nothing but melancholy, gentle melancholy, now as in
      old times when there was nothing to cause it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah-you only tease.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You will not throw aside that bitter medicine of distrust, for the world.
      You have grown so used to it, that you take it as food, as some invalids
      do their mixtures.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ethelberta, you have my heart-my whole heart. You have had it ever since
      I first saw you. Now you understand me, and no pretending that you don't,
      mind, this second time.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I understood you long ago; you have not understood me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are mysterious,' he said lightly; 'and perhaps if I disentangle your
      mystery I shall find it to cover-indifference. I hope it does-for your
      sake.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How can you say so!' she exclaimed reproachfully. 'Yet I wish it did
      too-I wish it did cover indifference-for yours. But you have all of me
      that you care to have, and may keep it for life if you wish to. Listen,
      surely there was a knock at the door? Let us go inside the room: I am
      always uneasy when anybody comes, lest any awkward discovery should be
      made by a visitor of my miserable contrivances for keeping up the
      establishment.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Joey met them before they had left the landing.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Please, Berta,' he whispered, 'Mr. Ladywell has called, and I've showed
      him into the liberry. You know, Berta, this is how it was, you know: I
      thought you and Mr. Julian were in the drawing-room, and wouldn't want him
      to see ye together, and so I asked him to step into the liberry a minute.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You must improve your way of speaking,' she said, with quick
      embarrassment, whether at the mention of Ladywell's name before Julian, or
      at the way Joey coupled herself with Christopher, was quite uncertain.
      'Will you excuse me for a few moments?' she said, turning to Christopher.
      'Pray sit down; I shall not be long.' And she glided downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had been standing just by the drawing-room door, and Christopher
      turned back into the room with no very satisfactory countenance. It was
      very odd, he thought, that she should go down to Ladywell in that
      mysterious manner, when he might have been admitted to where they were
      talking without any trouble at all. What could Ladywell have to say, as an
      acquaintance calling upon her for a few minutes, that he was not to hear?
      Indeed, if it came to that, what right had Ladywell to call upon her at
      all, even though she were a widow, and to some extent chartered to live in
      a way which might be considered a trifle free if indulged in by other
      young women. This was the first time that he himself had ventured into her
      house on that very account-a doubt whether it was quite proper to call,
      considering her youth, and the fertility of her position as ground for
      scandal. But no sooner did he arrive than here was Ladywell blundering in,
      and, since this conjunction had occurred on his first visit, the chances
      were that Ladywell came very often.

    <p>
      Julian walked up and down the room, every moment expanding itself to a
      minute in his impatience at the delay and vexation at the cause. After
      scrutinizing for the fifth time every object on the walls as if afflicted
      with microscopic closeness of sight, his hands under his coat-tails, and
      his person jigging up and down upon his toes, he heard her coming up the
      stairs. When she entered the apartment her appearance was decidedly that
      of a person subsiding after some little excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I did not calculate upon being so long,' she said sweetly, at the same
      time throwing back her face and smiling. 'But I-was longer than I
      expected.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It seemed rather long,' said Christopher gloomily, 'but I don't mind it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am glad of that,' said Ethelberta.
    </p>
    <p>
      'As you asked me to stay, I was very pleased to do so, and always should
      be; but I think that now I will wish you good-bye.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are not vexed with me?' she said, looking quite into his face. 'Mr.
      Ladywell is nobody, you know.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nobody?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, he is not much, I mean. The case is, that I am sitting to him for a
      subject in which my face is to be used-otherwise than as a portrait-and he
      called about it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'May I say,' said Christopher, 'that if you want yourself painted, you are
      ill-advised not to let it be done by a man who knows how to use the brush
      a little?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, he can paint!' said Ethelberta, rather warmly. 'His last picture was
      excellent, I think. It was greatly talked about.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I imagined you to say that he was a mere nobody!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, but-how provoking you are!-nobody, I mean, to talk to. He is a true
      artist, nevertheless.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher made no reply. The warm understanding between them had quite
      ended now, and there was no fanning it up again. Sudden tiffs had been the
      constant misfortune of their courtship in days gone by, had been the
      remote cause of her marriage to another; and the familiar shadows seemed
      to be rising again to cloud them with the same persistency as ever.
      Christopher went downstairs with well-behaved moodiness, and left the
      house forthwith. The postman came to the door at the same time.
    </p>

Ethelberta opened a letter from Picotee-now at Sandbourne again; and,
stooping to the fire-light, she began to read:-

    'MY DEAR ETHELBERTA,-I have tried to like staying at Sandbourne because you wished it, but I can't endure the town at all, dear Berta; everything is so wretched and dull!  O, I only wish you knew how dismal it is here, and how much I would give to come to London!  I cannot help thinking that I could do better in town.  You see, I should be close to you, and should have the benefit of your experience.  I would not mind what I did for a living could I be there where you all are.  It is so like banishment to be here.  If I could not get a pupil-teachership in some London school (and I believe I could by advertising) I could stay with you, and be governess to Georgina and Myrtle, for I am sure you cannot spare time enough to teach them as they ought to be taught, and Emmeline is not old enough to have any command over them.  I could also assist at your dressmaking, and you must require a great deal of that to be done if you continue to appear in public.  Mr. Long read in the papers the account of your first evening, and afterwards I heard two ladies of our committee talking about it; but of course not one of them knew my personal interest in the discussion.  Now will you, Ethelberta, think if I may not come: Do, there's a dear sister!  I will do anything you set me about if I may only come.-Your ever affectionate,                    PICOTEE.'
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
'Great powers above-what worries do beset me!' cried Ethelberta, jumping
up. 'What can possess the child so suddenly?-she used to like Sandbourne
well enough!' She sat down, and hastily scribbled the following reply:-

    'MY DEAR PICOTEE-There is only a little time to spare before the post goes, but I will try to answer your letter at once.  Whatever is the reason of this extraordinary dislike to Sandbourne?  It is a nice healthy place, and you are likely to do much better than either of our elder sisters, if you follow straight on in the path you have chosen.  Of course, if such good fortune should attend me that I get rich by my contrivances of public story-telling and so on, I shall share everything with you and the rest of us, in which case you shall not work at all.  But (although I have been unexpectedly successful so far) this is problematical; and it would be rash to calculate upon all of us being able to live, or even us seven girls only, upon the fortune I am going to make that way.  So, though I don't mean to be harsh, I must impress upon you the necessity of going on as you are going just at present.  I know the place must be dull, but we must all put up with dulness sometimes.  You, being next to me in age, must aid me as well as you can in doing something for the younger ones; and if anybody at all comes and lives here otherwise than as a servant, it must be our father-who will not, however, at present hear of such a thing when I mention it to him.  Do think of all this, Picotee, and bear up!  Perhaps we shall all be happy and united some day.  Joey is waiting to run to the post-office with this at once.  All are well.  Sol and Dan have nearly finished the repairs and decorations of my house-but I will tell you of that another time.-Your affectionate sister,                 BERTA.'

    <h2>
      18. NEAR SANDBOURNE-LONDON STREETS-ETHELBERTA'S
    </h2>
    <p>
      When this letter reached its destination the next morning, Picotee, in her
      over-anxiety, could not bring herself to read it in anybody's presence,
      and put it in her pocket till she was on her walk across the moor. She
      still lived at the cottage out of the town, though at some inconvenience
      to herself, in order to teach at a small village night-school whilst still
      carrying on her larger occupation of pupil-teacher in Sandbourne.
    </p>
    <p>
      So she walked and read, and was soon in tears. Moreover, when she thought
      of what Ethelberta would have replied had that keen sister known the
      wildness of her true reason in wishing to go, she shuddered with misery.
      To wish to get near a man only because he had been kind to her, and had
      admired her pretty face, and had given her flowers, to nourish a passion
      all the more because of its hopeless impracticability, were things to
      dream of, not to tell. Picotee was quite an unreasoning animal. Her sister
      arranged situations for her, told her how to conduct herself in them, how
      to make up anew, in unobtrusive shapes, the valuable wearing apparel she
      sent from time to time-so as to provoke neither exasperation in the little
      gentry, nor superciliousness in the great. Ethelberta did everything for
      her, in short; and Picotee obeyed orders with the abstracted ease of mind
      which people show who have their thinking done for them, and put out their
      troubles as they do their washing. She was quite willing not to be clever
      herself, since it was unnecessary while she had a much-admired sister, who
      was clever enough for two people and to spare.
    </p>
    <p>
      This arrangement, by which she gained an untroubled existence in exchange
      for freedom of will, had worked very pleasantly for Picotee until the
      anomaly of falling in love on her own account created a jar in the
      machinery. Then she began to know how wearing were miserable days, and how
      much more wearing were miserable nights. She pictured Christopher in
      London calling upon her dignified sister (for Ethelberta innocently
      mentioned his name sometimes in writing) and imagined over and over again
      the mutual signs of warm feeling between them. And now Picotee resolved
      upon a noble course. Like Juliet, she had been troubled with a
      consciousness that perhaps her love for Christopher was a trifle forward
      and unmaidenly, even though she had determined never to let him or anybody
      in the whole world know of it. To set herself to pray that she might have
      strength to see him without a pang the lover of her sister, who deserved
      him so much more than herself, would be a grand penance and corrective.
    </p>
    <p>
      After uttering petitions to this effect for several days, she still felt
      very bad; indeed, in the psychological difficulty of striving for what in
      her soul she did not desire, rather worse, if anything. At last, weary of
      walking the old road and never meeting him, and blank in a general
      powerlessness, she wrote the letter to Ethelberta, which was only the last
      one of a series that had previously been written and torn up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now this hope had been whirled away like thistledown, and the case was
      grievous enough to distract a greater stoic than Picotee. The end of it
      was that she left the school on insufficient notice, gave up her cottage
      home on the plea-true in the letter-that she was going to join a relative
      in London, and went off thither by a morning train, leaving her things
      packed ready to be sent on when she should write for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Picotee arrived in town late on a cold February afternoon, bearing a small
      bag in her hand. She crossed Westminster Bridge on foot, just after dusk,
      and saw a luminous haze hanging over each well-lighted street as it
      withdrew into distance behind the nearer houses, showing its direction as
      a train of morning mist shows the course of a distant stream when the
      stream itself is hidden. The lights along the riverside towards Charing
      Cross sent an inverted palisade of gleaming swords down into the shaking
      water, and the pavement ticked to the touch of pedestrians' feet, most of
      whom tripped along as if walking only to practise a favourite quick step,
      and held handkerchiefs to their mouths to strain off the river mist from
      their lungs. She inquired her way to Exonbury Crescent, and between five
      and six o'clock reached her sister's door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two or three minutes were passed in accumulating resolution sufficient to
      ring the bell, which when at last she did, was not performed in a way at
      all calculated to make the young man Joey hasten to the door. After the
      lapse of a certain time he did, however, find leisure to stroll and see
      what the caller might want, out of curiosity to know who there could be in
      London afraid to ring a bell twice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joey's delight exceeded even his surprise, the ruling maxim of his life
      being the more the merrier, under all circumstances. The beaming young man
      was about to run off and announce her upstairs and downstairs, left and
      right, when Picotee called him hastily to her. In the hall her quick young
      eye had caught sight of an umbrella with a peculiar horn handle-an
      umbrella she had been accustomed to meet on Sandbourne Moor on many happy
      afternoons. Christopher was evidently in the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Joey,' she said, as if she were ready to faint, 'don't tell Berta I am
      come. She has company, has she not?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no-only Mr. Julian!' said the brother. 'He's quite one of the family!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never mind-can't I go down into the kitchen with you?' she inquired.
      There had been bliss and misery mingled in those tidings, and she scarcely
      knew for a moment which way they affected her. What she did know was that
      she had run her dear fox to earth, and a sense of satisfaction at that
      feat prevented her just now from counting the cost of the performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Does Mr. Julian come to see her very often?' said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O yes-he's always a-coming-a regular bore to me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A regular what?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Bore!-Ah, I forgot, you don't know our town words. However, come along.'
    </p>
    <p>
      They passed by the doors on tiptoe, and their mother upstairs being,
      according to Joey's account, in the midst of a nap, Picotee was unwilling
      to disturb her; so they went down at once to the kitchen, when forward
      rushed Gwendoline the cook, flourishing her floury hands, and Cornelia the
      housemaid, dancing over her brush; and these having welcomed and made
      Picotee comfortable, who should ring the area-bell, and be admitted down
      the steps, but Sol and Dan. The workman-brothers, their day's duties being
      over, had called to see their relations, first, as usual, going home to
      their lodgings in Marylebone and making themselves as spruce as
      bridegrooms, according to the rules of their newly-acquired town
      experience. For the London mechanic is only nine hours a mechanic, though
      the country mechanic works, eats, drinks, and sleeps a mechanic throughout
      the whole twenty-four.
    </p>
    <p>
      'God bless my soul-Picotee!' said Dan, standing fixed. 'Well-I say, this
      is splendid! ha-ha!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Picotee-what brought you here?' said Sol, expanding the circumference of
      his face in satisfaction. 'Well, come along-never mind so long as you be
      here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Picotee explained circumstances as well as she could without stating them,
      and, after a general conversation of a few minutes, Sol interrupted
      with-'Anybody upstairs with Mrs. Petherwin?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr. Julian was there just now,' said Joey; 'but he may be gone. Berta
      always lets him slip out how he can, the form of ringing me up not being
      necessary with him. Wait a minute-I'll see.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Joseph vanished up the stairs; and, the question whether Christopher were
      gone or not being an uninteresting one to the majority, the talking went
      on upon other matters. When Joey crept down again a minute later, Picotee
      was sitting aloof and silent, and he accordingly singled her out to speak
      to.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Such a lark, Picotee!' he whispered. 'Berta's a-courting of her young
      man. Would you like to see how they carries on a bit?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dearly I should!' said Picotee, the pupils of her eyes dilating.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joey conducted her to the top of the basement stairs, and told her to
      listen. Within a few yards of them was the morning-room door, now standing
      ajar; and an intermittent flirtation in soft male and female tones could
      be heard going on inside. Picotee's lips parted at thus learning the
      condition of things, and she leant against the stair-newel.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My? What's the matter?' said Joey.
    </p>
    <p>
      'If this is London, I don't like it at all!' moaned Picotee.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well-I never see such a girl-fainting all over the stairs for nothing in
      the world.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O-it will soon be gone-it is-it is only indigestion.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Indigestion? Much you simple country people can know about that! You
      should see what devils of indigestions we get in high life-eating 'normous
      great dinners and suppers that require clever physicians to carry 'em off,
      or else they'd carry us off with gout next day; and waking in the morning
      with such a splitting headache, and dry throat, and inward cusses about
      human nature, that you feel all the world like some great lord. However,
      now let's go down again.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, no, no!' said the unhappy maiden imploringly. 'Hark!'
    </p>
    <p>
      They listened again. The voices of the musician and poetess had changed:
      there was a decided frigidity in their tone-then came a louder
      expression-then a silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You needn't be afeard,' said Joey. 'They won't fight; bless you, they
      busts out quarrelling like this times and times when they've been
      over-friendly, but it soon gets straight with 'em again.'
    </p>
    <p>
      There was now a quick walk across the room, and Joey and his sister drew
      down their heads out of sight. Then the room door was slammed, quick
      footsteps went along the hall, the front door closed just as loudly, and
      Christopher's tread passed into nothing along the pavement.
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's rather a wuss one than they mostly have; but Lord, 'tis nothing at
      all.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't much like biding here listening!' said Picotee.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, 'tis how we do all over the West End,' said Joey. ''Tis yer ignorance
      of town life that makes it seem a good deal to 'ee.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You can't make much boast about town life; for you haven't left off
      talking just as they do down in Wessex.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I own to that-what's fair is fair, and 'tis a true charge; but if I
      talk the Wessex way 'tisn't for want of knowing better; 'tis because my
      staunch nater makes me bide faithful to our old ancient institutions.
      You'd soon own 'twasn't ignorance in me, if you knowed what large
      quantities of noblemen I gets mixed up with every day. In fact 'tis
      thoughted here and there that I shall do very well in the world.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, let us go down,' said Picotee. 'Everything seems so overpowering
      here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, you'll get broke in soon enough. I felt just the same when I first
      entered into society.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you think Berta will be angry with me? How does she treat you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I can't complain. You see she's my own flesh and blood, and what
      can I say? But, in secret truth, the wages is terrible low, and barely
      pays for the tobacco I consooms.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O Joey, you wicked boy! If mother only knew that you smoked!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't mind the wickedness so much as the smell. And Mrs. Petherwin has
      got such a nose for a fellow's clothes. 'Tis one of the greatest knots in
      service-the smoke question. 'Tis thoughted that we shall make a great stir
      about it in the mansions of the nobility soon.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How much more you know of life than I do-you only fourteen and me
      seventeen!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, that's true. You see, age is nothing-'tis opportunity. And even I
      can't boast, for many a younger man knows more.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But don't smoke, Joey-there's a dear!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What can I do? Society hev its rules, and if a person wishes to keep
      himself up, he must do as the world do. We be all Fashion's slave-as much
      a slave as the meanest in the land!'
    </p>
    <p>
      They got downstairs again; and when the dinner of the French lady and
      gentleman had been sent up and cleared away, and also Ethelberta's evening
      tea (which she formed into a genuine meal, making a dinner of luncheon,
      when nobody was there, to give less trouble to her servant-sisters), they
      all sat round the fire. Then the rustle of a dress was heard on the
      staircase, and squirrel-haired Ethelberta appeared in person. It was her
      custom thus to come down every spare evening, to teach Joey and her
      sisters something or other-mostly French, which she spoke fluently; but
      the cook and housemaid showed more ambition than intelligence in acquiring
      that tongue, though Joey learnt it readily enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was consternation in the camp for a moment or two, on account of
      poor Picotee, Ethelberta being not without firmness in matters of
      discipline. Her eye instantly lighted upon her disobedient sister, now
      looking twice as disobedient as she really was.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, you are here, Picotee? I am glad to see you,' said the mistress of the
      house quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was altogether to Picotee's surprise, for she had expected a round
      rating at least, in her freshness hardly being aware that this reserve of
      feeling was an acquired habit of Ethelberta's, and that civility stood in
      town for as much vexation as a tantrum represented in Wessex.
    </p>
    <p>
      Picotee lamely explained her outward reasons for coming, and soon began to
      find that Ethelberta's opinions on the matter would not be known by the
      tones of her voice. But innocent Picotee was as wily as a religionist in
      sly elusions of the letter whilst infringing the spirit of a dictum; and
      by talking very softly and earnestly about the wondrous good she could do
      by remaining in the house as governess to the children, and playing the
      part of lady's-maid to her sister at show times, she so far coaxed
      Ethelberta out of her intentions that she almost accepted the plan as a
      good one. It was agreed that for the present, at any rate, Picotee should
      remain. Then a visit was made to Mrs. Chickerel's room, where the
      remainder of the evening was passed; and harmony reigned in the household.

    </h2>
    <p>
      Picotee's heart was fitfully glad. She was near the man who had enlarged
      her capacity from girl's to woman's, a little note or two of young feeling
      to a whole diapason; and though nearness was perhaps not in itself a great
      reason for felicity when viewed beside the complete realization of all
      that a woman can desire in such circumstances, it was much in comparison
      with the outer darkness of the previous time.
    </p>
    <p>
      It became evident to all the family that some misunderstanding had arisen
      between Ethelberta and Mr. Julian. What Picotee hoped in the centre of her
      heart as to the issue of the affair it would be too complex a thing to
      say. If Christopher became cold towards her sister he would not come to
      the house; if he continued to come it would really be as Ethelberta's
      lover-altogether, a pretty game of perpetual check for Picotee.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not make his appearance for several days. Picotee, being a
      presentable girl, and decidedly finer-natured than her sisters below
      stairs, was allowed to sit occasionally with Ethelberta in the afternoon,
      when the teaching of the little ones had been done for the day; and thus
      she had an opportunity of observing Ethelberta's emotional condition with
      reference to Christopher, which Picotee did with an interest that the
      elder sister was very far from suspecting.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first Ethelberta seemed blithe enough without him. One more day went,
      and he did not come, and then her manner was that of apathy. Another day
      passed, and from fanciful elevations of the eyebrow, and long breathings,
      it became apparent that Ethelberta had decidedly passed the indifferent
      stage, and was getting seriously out of sorts about him. Next morning she
      looked all hope. He did not come that day either, and Ethelberta began to
      look pale with fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why don't you go out?' said Picotee timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I can hardly tell: I have been expecting some one.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'When she comes I must run up to mother at once, must I not?' said clever
      Picotee.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is not a lady,' said Ethelberta blandly. She came then and stood by
      Picotee, and looked musingly out of the window. 'I may as well tell you,
      perhaps,' she continued. 'It is Mr. Julian. He is-I suppose-my lover, in
      plain English.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah!' said Picotee.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Whom I am not going to marry until he gets rich.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah-how strange! If I had him-such a lover, I mean-I would marry him if he
      continued poor.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't doubt it, Picotee; just as you come to London without caring
      about consequences, or would do any other crazy thing and not mind in the
      least what came of it. But somebody in the family must take a practical
      view of affairs, or we should all go to the dogs.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Picotee recovered from the snubbing which she felt that she deserved, and
      charged gallantly by saying, with delicate showings of indifference, 'Do
      you love this Mr. What's-his-name of yours?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr. Julian? O, he's a very gentlemanly man. That is, except when he is
      rude, and ill-uses me, and will not come and apologize!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If I had him-a lover, I would ask him to come if I wanted him to.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta did not give her mind to this remark; but, drawing a long
      breath, said, with a pouting laugh, which presaged unreality, 'The idea of
      his getting indifferent now! I have been intending to keep him on until I
      got tired of his attentions, and then put an end to them by marrying him;
      but here is he, before he has hardly declared himself, forgetting my
      existence as much as if he had vowed to love and cherish me for life. 'Tis
      an unnatural inversion of the manners of society.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'When did you first get to care for him, dear Berta?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O-when I had seen him once or twice.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Goodness-how quick you were!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes-if I am in the mind for loving I am not to be hindered by shortness
      of acquaintanceship.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nor I neither!' sighed Picotee.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nor any other woman. We don't need to know a man well in order to love
      him. That's only necessary when we want to leave off.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O Berta-you don't believe that!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If a woman did not invariably form an opinion of her choice before she
      has half seen him, and love him before she has half formed an opinion,
      there would be no tears and pining in the whole feminine world, and poets
      would starve for want of a topic. I don't believe it, do you say? Ah,
      well, we shall see.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Picotee did not know what to say to this; and Ethelberta left the room to
      see about her duties as public story-teller, in which capacity she had
      undertaken to appear again this very evening.

    <h2>
      20. THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF THE HALL-THE ROAD HOME
    </h2>
    <p>
      London was illuminated by the broad full moon. The pavements looked white
      as if mantled with snow; ordinary houses were sublimated to the rank of
      public buildings, public buildings to palaces, and the faces of women
      walking the streets to those of calendared saints and guardian-angels, by
      the pure bleaching light from the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the quiet little street where opened the private door of the Hall
      chosen by Ethelberta for her story-telling, a brougham was waiting. The
      time was about eleven o'clock; and presently a lady came out from the
      building, the moonbeams forthwith flooding her face, which they showed to
      be that of the Story-teller herself. She hastened across to the carriage,
      when a second thought arrested her motion: telling the man-servant and a
      woman inside the brougham to wait for her, she wrapped up her features and
      glided round to the front of the house, where she paused to observe the
      carriages and cabs driving up to receive the fashionable crowd stepping
      down from the doors. Standing here in the throng which her own talent and
      ingenuity had drawn together, she appeared to enjoy herself by listening
      for a minute or two to the names of several persons of more or less
      distinction as they were called out, and then regarded attentively the
      faces of others of lesser degree: to scrutinize the latter was, as the
      event proved, the real object of the journey from round the corner. When
      nearly every one had left the doors, she turned back disappointed.
      Ethelberta had been fancying that her alienated lover Christopher was in
      the back rows to-night, but, as far as could now be observed, the hopeful
      supposition was a false one.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she got round to the back again, a man came forward. It was Ladywell,
      whom she had spoken to already that evening. 'Allow me to bring you your
      note-book, Mrs. Petherwin: I think you had forgotten it,' he said. 'I
      assure you that nobody has handled it but myself.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta thanked him, and took the book. 'I use it to look into between
      the parts, in case my memory should fail me,' she explained. 'I remember
      that I did lay it down, now you remind me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Ladywell had apparently more to say, and moved by her side towards the
      carriage; but she declined the arm he offered, and said not another word
      till he went on, haltingly:
    </p>
    <p>
      'Your triumph to-night was very great, and it was as much a triumph to me
      as to you; I cannot express my feeling-I cannot say half that I would. If
      I might only-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Thank you much,' said Ethelberta, with dignity. 'Thank you for bringing
      my book, but I must go home now. I know that you will see that it is not
      necessary for us to be talking here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes-you are quite right,' said the repressed young painter, struck by her
      seriousness. 'Blame me; I ought to have known better. But perhaps a
      man-well, I will say it-a lover without indiscretion is no lover at all.
      Circumspection and devotion are a contradiction in terms. I saw that, and
      hoped that I might speak without real harm.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You calculated how to be uncalculating, and are natural by art!' she
      said, with the slightest accent of sarcasm. 'But pray do not attend me
      further-it is not at all necessary or desirable. My maid is in the
      carriage.' She bowed, turned, and entered the vehicle, seating herself
      beside Picotee.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It was harsh!' said Ladywell to himself, as he looked after the
      retreating carriage. 'I was a fool; but it was harsh. Yet what man on
      earth likes a woman to show too great a readiness at first? She is right:
      she would be nothing without repulse!' And he moved away in an opposite
      direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What man was that?' said Picotee, as they drove along.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O-a mere Mr. Ladywell: a painter of good family, to whom I have been
      sitting for what he calls an Idealization. He is a dreadful simpleton.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why did you choose him?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I did not: he chose me. But his silliness of behaviour is a hopeful sign
      for the picture. I have seldom known a man cunning with his brush who was
      not simple with his tongue; or, indeed, any skill in particular that was
      not allied to general stupidity.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Your own skill is not like that, is it, Berta?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'In men-in men. I don't mean in women. How childish you are!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The slight depression at finding that Christopher was not present, which
      had followed Ethelberta's public triumph that evening, was covered over,
      if not removed, by Ladywell's declaration, and she reached home serene in
      spirit. That she had not the slightest notion of accepting the impulsive
      painter made little difference; a lover's arguments being apt to affect a
      lady's mood as much by measure as by weight. A useless declaration like a
      rare china teacup with a hole in it, has its ornamental value in enlarging
      a collection.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner had they entered the house than Mr. Julian's card was
      discovered; and Joey informed them that he had come particularly to speak
      with Ethelberta, quite forgetting that it was her evening for
      tale-telling.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was real delight, for between her excitements Ethelberta had been
      seriously sick-hearted at the horrible possibility of his never calling
      again. But alas! for Christopher. There being nothing like a dead silence
      for getting one's off-hand sweetheart into a corner, there is nothing like
      prematurely ending it for getting into that corner one's self.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now won't I punish him for daring to stay away so long!' she exclaimed as
      soon as she got upstairs. 'It is as bad to show constancy in your manners
      as fickleness in your heart at such a time as this.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But I thought honesty was the best policy?' said Picotee.
    </p>
    <p>
      'So it is, for the man's purpose. But don't you go believing in sayings,
      Picotee: they are all made by men, for their own advantages. Women who use
      public proverbs as a guide through events are those who have not ingenuity
      enough to make private ones as each event occurs.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat down, and rapidly wrote a line to Mr. Julian:-
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    'EXONBURY CRESCENT.

    'I return from Mayfair Hall to find you have called.  You will, I know, be good enough to forgive my saying what seems an unfriendly thing, when I assure you that the circumstances of my peculiar situation make it desirable, if not necessary.  It is that I beg you not to give me the pleasure of a visit from you for some little time, for unhappily the frequency of your kind calls has been noticed; and I am now in fear that we may be talked about-invidiously-to the injury of us both.  The town, or a section of it, has turned its bull's-eye upon me with a brightness which I did not in the least anticipate; and you will, I am sure, perceive how indispensable it is that I should be circumspect.-Yours sincerely,

    E. PETHERWIN.'

      21. A STREET-NEIGH'S ROOMS-CHRISTOPHER'S ROOMS
    </h2>
    <p>
      As soon as Ethelberta had driven off from the Hall, Ladywell turned back
      again; and, passing the front entrance, overtook his acquaintance Mr.
      Neigh, who had been one of the last to emerge. The two were going in the
      same direction, and they walked a short distance together.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Has anything serious happened?' said Neigh, noticing an abstraction in
      his companion. 'You don't seem in your usual mood to-night.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, it is only that affair between us,' said Ladywell.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Affair? Between you and whom?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Her and myself, of course. It will be in every fellow's mouth now, I
      suppose!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But-not anything between yourself and Mrs. Petherwin?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A mere nothing. But surely you started, Neigh, when you suspected it just
      this moment?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No-you merely fancied that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Did she not speak well to-night! You were in the room, I believe?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, I just turned in for half-an-hour: it seems that everybody does, so
      I thought I must. But I had no idea that you were feeble that way.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is very kind of you, Neigh-upon my word it is-very kind; and of course
      I appreciate the delicacy which-which-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What's kind?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I mean your well-intentioned plan for making me believe that nothing is
      known of this. But stories will of course get wind; and if our attachment
      has made more noise in the world than I intended it should, and causes any
      public interest, why-ha-ha!-it must. There is some little romance in it
      perhaps, and people will talk of matters of that sort between individuals
      of any repute-little as that is with one of the pair.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of course they will-of course. You are a rising man, remember, whom some
      day the world will delight to honour.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Thank you for that, Neigh. Thank you sincerely.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not at all. It is merely justice to say it, and one must he generous to
      deserve thanks.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ha-ha!-that's very nicely put, and undeserved I am sure. And yet I need a
      word of that sort sometimes!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Genius is proverbially modest.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Pray don't, Neigh-I don't deserve it, indeed. Of course it is well meant
      in you to recognize any slight powers, but I don't deserve it. Certainly,
      my self-assurance was never too great. 'Tis the misfortune of all children
      of art that they should be so dependent upon any scraps of praise they can
      pick up to help them along.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And when that child gets so deep in love that you can only see the whites
      of his eyes-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah-now, Neigh-don't, I say!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But why did-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why did I love her?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, why did you love her?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, if I could only turn self-vivisector, and watch the operation of my
      heart, I should know!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'My dear fellow, you must be very bad indeed to talk like that. A poet
      himself couldn't be cleaner gone.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now, don't chaff, Neigh; do anything, but don't chaff. You know that I am
      the easiest man in the world for taking it at most times. But I can't
      stand it now; I don't feel up to it. A glimpse of paradise, and then
      perdition. What would you do, Neigh?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She has refused you, then?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well-not positively refused me; but it is so near it that a dull man
      couldn't tell the difference. I hardly can myself.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How do you really stand with her?' said Neigh, with an anxiety
      ill-concealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Off and on-neither one thing nor the other. I was determined to make an
      effort the last time she sat to me, and so I met her quite coolly, and
      spoke only of technicalities with a forced smile-you know that way of mine
      for drawing people out, eh, Neigh?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Quite, quite.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A forced smile, as much as to say, "I am obliged to entertain you, but as
      a mere model for art purposes." But the deuce a bit did she care. And then
      I frequently looked to see what time it was, as the end of the sitting
      drew near-rather a rude thing to do, as a rule.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of course. But that was your finesse. Ha-ha!-capital! Yet why not
      struggle against such slavery? It is regularly pulling you down. What's a
      woman's beauty, after all?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well you may say so! A thing easier to feel than define,' murmured
      Ladywell. 'But it's no use, Neigh-I can't help it as long as she repulses
      me so exquisitely! If she would only care for me a little, I might get to
      trouble less about her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And love her no more than one ordinarily does a girl by the time one gets
      irrevocably engaged to her. But I suppose she keeps you back so thoroughly
      that you carry on the old adoration with as much vigour as if it were a
      new fancy every time?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Partly yes, and partly no! It's very true, and it's not true!'
    </p>
    <p>
      ''Tis to be hoped she won't hate you outright, for then you would
      absolutely die of idolizing her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't, Neigh!-Still there's some truth in it-such is the perversity of
      our hearts. Fancy marrying such a woman!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'We should feel as eternally united to her after years and years of
      marriage as to a dear new angel met at last night's dance.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Exactly-just what I should have said. But did I hear you say "We," Neigh?
      You didn't say "WE should feel?"'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Say "we"?-yes-of course-putting myself in your place just in the way of
      speaking, you know.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of course, of course; but one is such a fool at these times that one
      seems to detect rivalry in every trumpery sound! Were you never a little
      touched?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not I. My heart is in the happy position of a country which has no
      history or debt.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I suppose I should rejoice to hear it,' said Ladywell. 'But the
      consciousness of a fellow-sufferer being in just such another hole is such
      a relief always, and softens the sense of one's folly so very much.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'There's less Christianity in that sentiment than in your confessing to
      it, old fellow. I know the truth of it nevertheless, and that's why
      married men advise others to marry. Were all the world tied up, the
      pleasantly tied ones would be equivalent to those at present free. But
      what if your fellow-sufferer is not only in another such a hole, but in
      the same one?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, Neigh-never! Don't trifle with a friend who-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That is, refused like yourself, as well as in love.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, thanks, thanks! It suddenly occurred to me that we might be dead
      against one another as rivals, and a friendship of many long-days be
      snapped like a-like a reed.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No-no-only a jest,' said Neigh, with a strangely accelerated speech.
      'Love-making is an ornamental pursuit that matter-of-fact fellows like me
      are quite unfit for. A man must have courted at least half-a-dozen women
      before he's a match for one; and since triumph lies so far ahead, I shall
      keep out of the contest altogether.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Your life would be pleasanter if you were engaged. It is a nice thing,
      after all.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is. The worst of it would be that, when the time came for breaking it
      off, a fellow might get into an action for breach-women are so fond of
      that sort of thing now; and I hate love-affairs that don't end peaceably!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But end it by peaceably marrying, my dear fellow!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It would seem so singular. Besides, I have a horror of antiquity: and you
      see, as long as a man keeps single, he belongs in a measure to the rising
      generation, however old he may be; but as soon as he marries and has
      children, he belongs to the last generation, however young he may be. Old
      Jones's son is a deal younger than young Brown's father, though they are
      both the same age.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'At any rate, honest courtship cures a man of many evils he had no power
      to stem before.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'By substituting an incurable matrimony!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah-two persons must have a mind for that before it can happen!' said
      Ladywell, sorrowfully shaking his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I think you'll find that if one has a mind for it, it will be quite
      sufficient. But here we are at my rooms. Come in for half-an-hour?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not to-night, thanks!'
    </p>
    <p>
      They parted, and Neigh went in. When he got upstairs he murmured in his
      deepest chest note, 'O, lords, that I should come to this! But I shall
      never be such a fool as to marry her! What a flat that poor young devil
      was not to discover that we were tarred with the same brush. O, the deuce,
      the deuce!' he continued, walking about the room as if passionately
      stamping, but not quite doing it because another man had rooms below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neigh drew from his pocket-book an envelope embossed with the name of a
      fashionable photographer, and out of this pulled a portrait of the lady
      who had, in fact, enslaved his secret self equally with his frank young
      friend the painter. After contemplating it awhile with a face of cynical
      adoration, he murmured, shaking his head, 'Ah, my lady; if you only knew
      this, I should be snapped up like a snail! Not a minute's peace for me
      till I had married you. I wonder if I shall!-I wonder.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Neigh was a man of five-and-thirty-Ladywell's senior by ten years; and,
      being of a phlegmatic temperament, he had glided thus far through the
      period of eligibility with impunity. He knew as well as any man how far he
      could go with a woman and yet keep clear of having to meet her in church
      without her bonnet; but it is doubtful if his mind that night were less
      disturbed with the question how to guide himself out of the natural course
      which his passion for Ethelberta might tempt him into, than was Ladywell's
      by his ardent wish to secure her.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      About the time at which Neigh and Ladywell parted company, Christopher
      Julian was entering his little place in Bloomsbury. The quaint figure of
      Faith, in her bonnet and cloak, was kneeling on the hearth-rug
      endeavouring to stir a dull fire into a bright one.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What-Faith! you have never been out alone?' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Faith's soft, quick-shutting eyes looked unutterable things, and she
      replied, 'I have been to hear Mrs. Petherwin's story-telling again.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And walked all the way home through the streets at this time of night, I
      suppose!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, nobody molested me, either going or coming back.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Faith, I gave you strict orders not to go into the streets after two
      o'clock in the day, and now here you are taking no notice of what I say at
      all!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The truth is, Kit, I wanted to see with my spectacles what this woman was
      really like, and I went without them last time. I slipped in behind, and
      nobody saw me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't think much of her after what I have seen tonight,' said
      Christopher, moodily recurring to a previous thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why? What is the matter?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I thought I would call on her this afternoon, but when I got there I
      found she had left early for the performance. So in the evening, when I
      thought it would be all over, I went to the private door of the Hall to
      speak to her as she came out, and ask her flatly a question or two which I
      was fool enough to think I must ask her before I went to bed. Just as I
      was drawing near she came out, and, instead of getting into the brougham
      that was waiting for her, she went round the corner. When she came back a
      man met her and gave her something, and they stayed talking together two
      or three minutes. The meeting may certainly not have been intentional on
      her part; but she has no business to be going on so coolly when-when-in
      fact, I have come to the conclusion that a woman's affection is not worth
      having. The only feeling which has any dignity or permanence or worth is
      family affection between close blood-relations.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And yet you snub me sometimes, Mr. Kit.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And, for the matter of that, you snub me. Still, you know what I
      mean-there's none of that off-and-on humbug between us. If we grumble with
      one another we are united just the same: if we don't write when we are
      parted, we are just the same when we meet-there has been some rational
      reason for silence; but as for lovers and sweethearts, there is nothing
      worth a rush in what they feel!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Faith said nothing in reply to this. The opinions she had formed upon the
      wisdom of her brother's pursuit of Ethelberta would have come just then
      with an ill grace. It must, however, have been evident to Christopher, had
      he not been too preoccupied for observation, that Faith's impressions of
      Ethelberta were not quite favourable as regarded her womanhood,
      notwithstanding that she greatly admired her talents.

      22. ETHELBERTA'S HOUSE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Ethelberta came indoors one day from the University boat-race, and sat
      down, without speaking, beside Picotee, as if lost in thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Did you enjoy the sight?' said Picotee.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I scarcely know. We couldn't see at all from Mrs. Belmaine's carriage, so
      two of us-very rashly-agreed to get out and be rowed across to the other
      side where the people were quite few. But when the boatman had us in the
      middle of the river he declared he couldn't land us on the other side
      because of the barges, so there we were in a dreadful state-tossed up and
      down like corks upon great waves made by steamers till I made up my mind
      for a drowning. Well, at last we got back again, but couldn't reach the
      carriage for the crowd; and I don't know what we should have done if a
      gentleman hadn't come-sent by Mrs. Belmaine, who was in a great fright
      about us; then he was introduced to me, and-I wonder how it will end!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Was there anything so wonderful in the beginning, then?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. One of the coolest and most practised men in London was ill-mannered
      towards me from sheer absence of mind-and could there be higher flattery?
      When a man of that sort does not give you the politeness you deserve, it
      means that in his heart he is rebelling against another feeling which his
      pride suggests that you do not deserve. O, I forgot to say that he is a
      Mr. Neigh, a nephew of Mr. Doncastle's, who lives at ease about Piccadilly
      and Pall Mall, and has a few acres somewhere-but I don't know much of him.
      The worst of my position now is that I excite this superficial interest in
      many people and a deep friendship in nobody. If what all my supporters
      feel could be collected into the hearts of two or three they would love me
      better than they love themselves; but now it pervades all and operates in
      none.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But it must operate in this gentleman?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, yes-just for the present. But men in town have so many contrivances
      for getting out of love that you can't calculate upon keeping them in for
      two days together. However, it is all the same to me. There's only-but let
      that be.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What is there only?' said Picotee coaxingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Only one man,' murmured Ethelberta, in much lower tones. 'I mean, whose
      wife I should care to be; and the very qualities I like in him will, I
      fear, prevent his ever being in a position to ask me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is he the man you punished the week before last by forbidding him to
      come?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Perhaps he is: but he does not want civility from me. Where there's much
      feeling there's little ceremony.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It certainly seems that he does not want civility from you to make him
      attentive to you,' said Picotee, stifling a sigh; 'for here is a letter in
      his handwriting, I believe.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You might have given it to me at once,' said Ethelberta, opening the
      envelope hastily. It contained very few sentences: they were to the effect
      that Christopher had received her letter forbidding him to call; that he
      had therefore at first resolved not to call or even see her more, since he
      had become such a shadow in her path. Still, as it was always best to do
      nothing hastily, he had on second thoughts decided to ask her to grant him
      a last special favour, and see him again just once, for a few minutes only
      that afternoon, in which he might at least say Farewell. To avoid all
      possibility of compromising her in anybody's eyes, he would call at
      half-past six, when other callers were likely to be gone, knowing that
      from the peculiar constitution of the household the hour would not
      interfere with her arrangements. There being no time for an answer, he
      would assume that she would see him, and keep the engagement; the request
      being one which could not rationally be objected to.
    </p>
    <p>
      'There-read it!' said Ethelberta, with glad displeasure. 'Did you ever
      hear such audacity? Fixing a time so soon that I cannot reply, and thus
      making capital out of a pretended necessity, when it is really an
      arbitrary arrangement of his own. That's real rebellion-forcing himself
      into my house when I said strictly he was not to come; and then, that it
      cannot rationally be objected to-I don't like his "rationally."'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Where there's much love there's little ceremony, didn't you say just
      now?' observed innocent Picotee.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And where there's little love, no ceremony at all. These manners of his
      are dreadful, and I believe he will never improve.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It makes you care not a bit about him, does it not, Berta?' said Picotee
      hopefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't answer for that,' said Ethelberta. 'I feel, as many others do,
      that a want of ceremony which is produced by abstraction of mind is no
      defect in a poet or musician, fatal as it may be to an ordinary man.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mighty me! You soon forgive him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Picotee, don't you be so quick to speak. Before I have finished, how do
      you know what I am going to say? I'll never tell you anything again, if
      you take me up so. Of course I am going to punish him at once, and make
      him remember that I am a lady, even if I do like him a little.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How do you mean to punish him?' said Picotee, with interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      'By writing and telling him that on no account is he to come.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But there is not time for a letter-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That doesn't matter. It will show him that I did not mean him to come.'
    </p>
    <p>
      At hearing the very merciful nature of the punishment, Picotee sighed
      without replying; and Ethelberta despatched her note. The hour of
      appointment drew near, and Ethelberta showed symptoms of unrest. Six
      o'clock struck and passed. She walked here and there for nothing, and it
      was plain that a dread was filling her: her letter might accidentally have
      had, in addition to the moral effect which she had intended, the practical
      effect which she did not intend, by arriving before, instead of after, his
      purposed visit to her, thereby stopping him in spite of all her care.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How long are letters going to Bloomsbury?' she said suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Two hours, Joey tells me,' replied Picotee, who had already inquired on
      her own private account.
    </p>
    <p>
      'There!' exclaimed Ethelberta petulantly. 'How I dislike a man to
      misrepresent things! He said there was not time for a reply!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Perhaps he didn't know,' said Picotee, in angel tones; 'and so it happens
      all right, and he has got it, and he will not come after all.'
    </p>
    <p>
      They waited and waited, but Christopher did not appear that night; the
      true case being that his declaration about insufficient time for a reply
      was merely an ingenious suggestion to her not to be so cruel as to forbid
      him. He was far from suspecting when the letter of denial did reach
      him-about an hour before the time of appointment-that it was sent by a
      refinement of art, of which the real intention was futility, and that but
      for his own misstatement it would have been carefully delayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day another letter came from the musician, decidedly short and to
      the point. The irate lover stated that he would not be made a fool of any
      longer: under any circumstances he meant to come that self-same afternoon,
      and should decidedly expect her to see him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will not see him!' said Ethelberta. 'Why did he not call last night?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Because you told him not to,' said Picotee.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good gracious, as if a woman's words are to be translated as literally as
      Homer! Surely he is aware that more often than not "No" is said to a man's
      importunities because it is traditionally the correct modest reply, and
      for nothing else in the world. If all men took words as superficially as
      he does, we should die of decorum in shoals.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, Berta! how could you write a letter that you did not mean should be
      obeyed?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I did in a measure mean it, although I could have shown Christian
      forgiveness if it had not been. Never mind; I will not see him. I'll
      plague my heart for the credit of my sex.'
    </p>
    <p>
      To ensure the fulfilment of this resolve, Ethelberta determined to give
      way to a headache that she was beginning to be aware of, go to her room,
      disorganize her dress, and ruin her hair by lying down; so putting it out
      of her power to descend and meet Christopher on any momentary impulse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Picotee sat in the room with her, reading, or pretending to read, and
      Ethelberta pretended to sleep. Christopher's knock came up the stairs, and
      with it the end of the farce.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll tell you what,' said Ethelberta in the prompt and broadly-awake tone
      of one who had been concentrated on the expectation of that sound for a
      length of time, 'it was a mistake in me to do this! Joey will be sure to
      make a muddle of it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Joey was heard coming up the stairs. Picotee opened the door, and said,
      with an anxiety transcending Ethelberta's, 'Well?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, will you tell Mrs. Petherwin that Mr. Julian says he'll wait.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You were not to ask him to wait,' said Ethelberta, within.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I know that,' said Joey, 'and I didn't. He's doing that out of his own
      head.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then let Mr. Julian wait, by all means,' said Ethelberta. 'Allow him to
      wait if he likes, but tell him it is uncertain if I shall be able to come
      down.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Joey then retired, and the two sisters remained in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I wonder if he's gone,' Ethelberta said, at the end of a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I thought you were asleep,' said Picotee. 'Shall we ask Joey? I have not
      heard the door close.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Joey was summoned, and after a leisurely ascent, interspersed by various
      gymnastic performances over the handrail here and there, appeared again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He's there jest the same: he don't seem to be in no hurry at all,' said
      Joey.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What is he doing?' inquired Picotee solicitously.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, only looking at his watch sometimes, and humming tunes, and playing
      rat-a-tat-tat upon the table. He says he don't mind waiting a bit.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You must have made a mistake in the message,' said Ethelberta, within.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, no. I am correct as a jineral thing. I jest said perhaps you would
      be engaged all the evening, and perhaps you wouldn't.'
    </p>
    <p>
      When Joey had again retired, and they had waited another ten minutes,
      Ethelberta said, 'Picotee, do you go down and speak a few words to him. I
      am determined he shall not see me. You know him a little; you remember
      when he came to the Lodge?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What must I say to him?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta paused before replying. 'Try to find out if-if he is much
      grieved at not seeing me, and say-give him to understand that I will
      forgive him, Picotee.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very well.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And Picotee-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If he says he must see me-I think I will get up. But only if he says
      must: you remember that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Picotee departed on her errand. She paused on the staircase trembling, and
      thinking between the thrills how very far would have been the conduct of
      her poor slighted self from proud recalcitration had Mr. Julian's gentle
      request been addressed to her instead of to Ethelberta; and she went some
      way in the painful discovery of how much more tantalizing it was to watch
      an envied situation that was held by another than to be out of sight of it
      altogether. Here was Christopher waiting to bestow love, and Ethelberta
      not going down to receive it: a commodity unequalled in value by any other
      in the whole wide world was being wantonly wasted within that very house.
      If she could only have stood to-night as the beloved Ethelberta, and not
      as the despised Picotee, how different would be this going down! Thus she
      went along, red and pale moving in her cheeks as in the Northern Lights at
      their strongest time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Christopher had sat waiting minute by minute till the evening
      shades grew browner, and the fire sank low. Joey, finding himself not
      particularly wanted upon the premises after the second inquiry, had
      slipped out to witness a nigger performance round the corner, and Julian
      began to think himself forgotten by all the household. The perception
      gradually cooled his emotions and enabled him to hold his hat quite
      steadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Picotee gently thrust open the door she was surprised to find the
      room in darkness, the fire gone completely out, and the form of
      Christopher only visible by a faint patch of light, which, coming from a
      lamp on the opposite side of the way and falling upon the mirror, was
      thrown as a pale nebulosity upon his shoulder. Picotee was too flurried at
      sight of the familiar outline to know what to do, and, instead of going or
      calling for a light, she mechanically advanced into the room. Christopher
      did not turn or move in any way, and then she perceived that he had begun
      to doze in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly, with the precipitancy of the timorous, she said, 'Mr. Julian!'
      and touched him on the shoulder-murmuring then, 'O, I beg pardon, I-I will
      get a light.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher's consciousness returned, and his first act, before rising,
      was to exclaim, in a confused manner, 'Ah-you have come-thank you, Berta!'
      then impulsively to seize her hand, as it hung beside his head, and kiss
      it passionately. He stood up, still holding her fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Picotee gasped out something, but was completely deprived of articulate
      utterance, and in another moment being unable to control herself at this
      sort of first meeting with the man she had gone through fire and water to
      be near, and more particularly by the overpowering kiss upon her hand,
      burst into hysterical sobbing. Julian, in his inability to imagine so much
      emotion-or at least the exhibition of it-in Ethelberta, gently drew
      Picotee further forward by the hand he held, and utilized the solitary
      spot of light from the mirror by making it fall upon her face. Recognizing
      the childish features, he at once, with an exclamation, dropped her hand
      and started back. Being in point of fact a complete bundle of nerves and
      nothing else, his thin figure shook like a harp-string in painful
      excitement at a contretemps which would scarcely have quickened the pulse
      of an ordinary man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Picotee, feeling herself in the wind of a civil d&mdash;-, started
      back also, sobbing more than ever. It was a little too much that the first
      result of his discovery of the mistake should be absolute repulse. She
      leant against the mantelpiece, when Julian, much bewildered at her
      superfluity of emotion, assisted her to a seat in sheer humanity. But
      Christopher was by no means pleased when he again thought round the circle
      of circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How could you allow such an absurd thing to happen?' he said, in a stern,
      though trembling voice. 'You knew I might mistake. I had no idea you were
      in the house: I thought you were miles away, at Sandbourne or somewhere!
      But I see: it is just done for a joke, ha-ha!'
    </p>
    <p>
      This made Picotee rather worse still. 'O-O-O-O!' she replied, in the tone
      of pouring from a bottle. 'What shall I do-o-o-o! It is-not done for
      a-joke at all-l-l-l!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not done for a joke? Then never mind-don't cry, Picotee. What was it done
      for, I wonder?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Picotee, mistaking the purport of his inquiry, imagined him to refer to
      her arrival in the house, quite forgetting, in her guilty sense of having
      come on his account, that he would have no right or thought of asking
      questions about a natural visit to a sister, and she said: 'When you-went
      away from-Sandbourne, I-I-I didn't know what to do, and then I ran away,
      and came here, and then Ethelberta-was angry with me; but she says I may
      stay; but she doesn't know that I know you, and how we used to meet along
      the road every morning-and I am afraid to tell her-O, what shall I do!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never mind it,' said Christopher, a sense of the true state of her case
      dawning upon him with unpleasant distinctness, and bringing some
      irritation at his awkward position; though it was impossible to be long
      angry with a girl who had not reasoning foresight enough to perceive that
      doubtful pleasure and certain pain must be the result of any meeting
      whilst hearts were at cross purposes in this way.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Where is your sister?' he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      'She wouldn't come down, unless she MUST,' said Picotee. 'You have vexed
      her, and she has a headache besides that, and I came instead.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'So that I mightn't be wasted altogether. Well, it's a strange business
      between the three of us. I have heard of one-sided love, and reciprocal
      love, and all sorts, but this is my first experience of a concatenated
      affection. You follow me, I follow Ethelberta, and she follows-Heaven
      knows who!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr. Ladywell!' said the mortified Picotee.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good God, if I didn't think so!' said Christopher, feeling to the soles
      of his feet like a man in a legitimate drama.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, no, no!' said the frightened girl hastily. 'I am not sure it is Mr.
      Ladywell. That's altogether a mistake of mine!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, yes, you want to screen her,' said Christopher, with a withering
      smile at the spot of light. 'Very sisterly, doubtless; but none of that
      will do for me. I am too old a bird by far-by very far! Now are you sure
      she does not love Ladywell?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, perhaps I blame her wrongly. She may have some little good faith-a
      woman has, here and there. How do you know she does not love Ladywell?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Because she would prefer Mr. Neigh to him, any day.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ha!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, no-you mistake, sir-she doesn't love either at all-Ethelberta
      doesn't. I meant that she cannot love Mr. Ladywell because he stands lower
      in her opinion than Mr. Neigh, and him she certainly does not care for.
      She only loves you. If you only knew how true she is you wouldn't be so
      suspicious about her, and I wish I had not come here-yes, I do!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I cannot tell what to think of it. Perhaps I don't know much of this
      world after all, or what girls will do. But you don't excuse her to me,
      Picotee.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Before this time Picotee had been simulating haste in getting a light; but
      in her dread of appearing visibly to Christopher's eyes, and showing him
      the precise condition of her tear-stained face, she put it off moment
      after moment, and stirred the fire, in hope that the faint illumination
      thus produced would be sufficient to save her from the charge of stupid
      conduct as entertainer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fluttering about on the horns of this dilemma, she was greatly relieved
      when Christopher, who read her difficulty, and the general painfulness of
      the situation, said that since Ethelberta was really suffering from a
      headache he would not wish to disturb her till to-morrow, and went off
      downstairs and into the street without further ceremony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile other things had happened upstairs. No sooner had Picotee left
      her sister's room, than Ethelberta thought it would after all have been
      much better if she had gone down herself to speak to this admirably
      persistent lover. Was she not drifting somewhat into the character of
      coquette, even if her ground of offence-a word of Christopher's about
      somebody else's mean parentage, which was spoken in utter forgetfulness of
      her own position, but had wounded her to the quick nevertheless-was to
      some extent a tenable one? She knew what facilities in suffering
      Christopher always showed; how a touch to other people was a blow to him,
      a blow to them his deep wound, although he took such pains to look stolid
      and unconcerned under those inflictions, and tried to smile as if he had
      no feelings whatever. It would be more generous to go down to him, and be
      kind. She jumped up with that alertness which comes so spontaneously at
      those sweet bright times when desire and duty run hand in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      She hastily set her hair and dress in order-not such matchless order as
      she could have wished them to be in, but time was precious-and descended
      the stairs. When on the point of pushing open the drawing-room door, which
      wanted about an inch of being closed, she was astounded to discover that
      the room was in total darkness, and still more to hear Picotee sobbing
      inside. To retreat again was the only action she was capable of at that
      moment: the clash between this picture and the anticipated scene of
      Picotee and Christopher sitting in frigid propriety at opposite sides of a
      well-lighted room was too great. She flitted upstairs again with the least
      possible rustle, and flung herself down on the couch as before, panting
      with excitement at the new knowledge that had come to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was only one possible construction to be put upon this in
      Ethelberta's rapid mind, and that approximated to the true one. She had
      known for some time that Picotee once had a lover, or something akin to
      it, and that he had disappointed her in a way which had never been told.
      No stranger, save in the capacity of the one beloved, could wound a woman
      sufficiently to make her weep, and it followed that Christopher was the
      man of Picotee's choice. As Ethelberta recalled the conversations,
      conclusion after conclusion came like pulsations in an aching head. 'O,
      how did it happen, and who is to blame?' she exclaimed. 'I cannot doubt
      his faith, and I cannot doubt hers; and yet how can I keep doubting them
      both?'
    </p>
    <p>
      It was characteristic of Ethelberta's jealous motherly guard over her
      young sisters that, amid these contending inquiries, her foremost feeling
      was less one of hope for her own love than of championship for Picotee's.

    <h2>
      23. ETHELBERTA'S HOUSE (continued)
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Picotee was heard on the stairs: Ethelberta covered her face.
    </h3>
    <p>
      'Is he waiting?' she said faintly, on finding that Picotee did not begin
      to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No; he is gone,' said Picotee.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, why is that?' came quickly from under the handkerchief. 'He has
      forgotten me-that's what it is!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no, he has not!' said Picotee, just as bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta had far too much heroism to let much in this strain escape her,
      though her sister was prepared to go any lengths in the same. 'I suppose,'
      continued Ethelberta, in the quiet way of one who had only a headache the
      matter with her, 'that he remembered you after the meeting at Anglebury?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, he remembered me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Did you tell me you had seen him before that time?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I had seen him at Sandbourne. I don't think I told you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'At whose house did you meet him?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'At nobody's. I only saw him sometimes,' replied Picotee, in great
      distress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta, though of all women most miserable, was brimming with
      compassion for the throbbing girl so nearly related to her, in whom she
      continually saw her own weak points without the counterpoise of her strong
      ones. But it was necessary to repress herself awhile: the intended ways of
      her life were blocked and broken up by this jar of interests, and she
      wanted time to ponder new plans. 'Picotee, I would rather be alone now, if
      you don't mind,' she said. 'You need not leave me any light; it makes my
      eyes ache, I think.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Picotee left the room. But Ethelberta had not long been alone and in
      darkness when somebody gently opened the door, and entered without a
      candle.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Berta,' said the soft voice of Picotee again, 'may I come in?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O yes,' said Ethelberta. 'Has everything gone right with the house this
      evening?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes; and Gwendoline went out just now to buy a few things, and she is
      going to call round upon father when he has got his dinner cleared away.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I hope she will not stay and talk to the other servants. Some day she
      will let drop something or other before father can stop her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O Berta!' said Picotee, close beside her. She was kneeling in front of
      the couch, and now flinging her arm across Ethelberta's shoulder and
      shaking violently, she pressed her forehead against her sister's temple,
      and breathed out upon her cheek:
    </p>
    <p>
      'I came in again to tell you something which I ought to have told you just
      now, and I have come to say it at once because I am afraid I shan't be
      able to to-morrow. Mr. Julian was the young man I spoke to you of a long
      time ago, and I should have told you all about him, but you said he was
      your young man too, and-and I didn't know what to do then, because I
      thought it was wrong in me to love your young man; and Berta, he didn't
      mean me to love him at all, but I did it myself, though I did not want to
      do it, either; it would come to me! And I didn't know he belonged to you
      when I began it, or I would not have let him meet me at all; no I
      wouldn't!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Meet you? You don't mean to say he used to meet you?' whispered
      Ethelberta.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' said Picotee; 'but he could not help it. We used to meet on the
      road, and there was no other road unless I had gone ever so far round. But
      it is worse than that, Berta! That was why I couldn't bide in Sandbourne,
      and-and ran away to you up here; it was not because I wanted to see you,
      Berta, but because I-I wanted-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, yes, I know,' said Ethelberta hurriedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And then when I went downstairs he mistook me for you for a moment, and
      that caused-a confusion!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, well, it does not much matter,' said Ethelberta, kissing Picotee
      soothingly. 'You ought not of course to have come to London in such a
      manner; but, since you have come, we will make the best of it. Perhaps it
      may end happily for you and for him. Who knows?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then don't you want him, Berta?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no; not at all!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What-and don't you really want him, Berta?' repeated Picotee, starting
      up.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I would much rather he paid his addresses to you. He is not the sort of
      man I should wish to-think it best to marry, even if I were to marry,
      which I have no intention of doing at present. He calls to see me because
      we are old friends, but his calls do not mean anything more than that he
      takes an interest in me. It is not at all likely that I shall see him
      again! and I certainly never shall see him unless you are present.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That will be very nice.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. And you will be always distant towards him, and go to leave the room
      when he comes, when I will call you back; but suppose we continue this
      to-morrow? I can tell you better then what to do.'
    </p>
    <p>
      When Picotee had left her the second time, Ethelberta turned over upon her
      breast and shook in convulsive sobs which had little relationship with
      tears. This abandonment ended as suddenly as it had begun-not lasting more
      than a minute and a half altogether-and she got up in an unconsidered and
      unusual impulse to seek relief from the stinging sarcasm of this event-the
      unhappy love of Picotee-by mentioning something of it to another member of
      the family, her eldest sister Gwendoline, who was a woman full of
      sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta descended to the kitchen, it being now about ten o'clock. The
      room was empty, Gwendoline not having yet returned, and Cornelia, being
      busy about her own affairs upstairs. The French family had gone to the
      theatre, and the house on that account was very quiet to-night. Ethelberta
      sat down in the dismal place without turning up the gas, and in a few
      minutes admitted Gwendoline.
    </p>
    <p>
      The round-faced country cook floundered in, untying her bonnet as she
      came, laying it down on a chair, and talking at the same time. 'Such a
      place as this London is, to be sure!' she exclaimed, turning on the gas
      till it whistled. 'I wish I was down in Wessex again. Lord-a-mercy, Berta,
      I didn't see it was you! I thought it was Cornelia. As I was saying, I
      thought that, after biding in this underground cellar all the week, making
      up messes for them French folk, and never pleasing 'em, and never shall,
      because I don't understand that line, I thought I would go out and see
      father, you know.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is he very well?' said Ethelberta.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes; and he is going to call round when he has time. Well, as I was
      a-coming home-along I thought, "Please the Lord I'll have some chippols
      for supper just for a plain trate," and I went round to the late
      greengrocer's for 'em; and do you know they sweared me down that they
      hadn't got such things as chippols in the shop, and had never heard of 'em
      in their lives. At last I said, "Why, how can you tell me such a brazen
      story?-here they be, heaps of 'em!" It made me so vexed that I came away
      there and then, and wouldn't have one-no, not at a gift.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'They call them young onions here,' said Ethelberta quietly; 'you must
      always remember that. But, Gwendoline, I wanted-'
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta felt sick at heart, and stopped. She had come down on the wings
      of an impulse to unfold her trouble about Picotee to her hard-headed and
      much older sister, less for advice than to get some heart-ease by
      interchange of words; but alas, she could proceed no further. The wretched
      homeliness of Gwendoline's mind seemed at this particular juncture to be
      absolutely intolerable, and Ethelberta was suddenly convinced that to
      involve Gwendoline in any such discussion would simply be increasing her
      own burden, and adding worse confusion to her sister's already confused
      existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What were you going to say?' said the honest and unsuspecting Gwendoline.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will put it off until to-morrow,' Ethelberta murmured gloomily; 'I have
      a bad headache, and I am afraid I cannot stay with you after all.'
    </p>
    <p>
      As she ascended the stairs, Ethelberta ached with an added pain not much
      less than the primary one which had brought her down. It was that old
      sense of disloyalty to her class and kin by feeling as she felt now which
      caused the pain, and there was no escaping it. Gwendoline would have gone
      to the ends of the earth for her: she could not confide a thought to
      Gwendoline!
    </p>
    <p>
      'If she only knew of that unworthy feeling of mine, how she would grieve,'
      said Ethelberta miserably.
    </p>
    <p>
      She next went up to the servants' bedrooms, and to where Cornelia slept.
      On Ethelberta's entrance Cornelia looked up from a perfect wonder of a
      bonnet, which she held in her hands. At sight of Ethelberta the look of
      keen interest in her work changed to one of gaiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am so glad-I was just coming down,' Cornelia said in a whisper;
      whenever they spoke as relations in this house it was in whispers. 'Now,
      how do you think this bonnet will do? May I come down, and see how I look
      in your big glass?' She clapped the bonnet upon her head. 'Won't it do
      beautiful for Sunday afternoon?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It looks very attractive, as far as I can see by this light,' said
      Ethelberta. 'But is it not rather too brilliant in colour-blue and red
      together, like that? Remember, as I often tell you, people in town never
      wear such bright contrasts as they do in the country.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O Berta!' said Cornelia, in a deprecating tone; 'don't object. If there's
      one thing I do glory in it is a nice flare-up about my head o' Sundays-of
      course if the family's not in mourning, I mean.' But, seeing that
      Ethelberta did not smile, she turned the subject, and added docilely: 'Did
      you come up for me to do anything? I will put off finishing my bonnet if I
      am wanted.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I was going to talk to you about family matters, and Picotee,' said
      Ethelberta. 'But, as you are busy, and I have a headache, I will put it
      off till to-morrow.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Cornelia seemed decidedly relieved, for family matters were far from
      attractive at the best of times; and Ethelberta went down to the next
      floor, and entered her mother's room.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a short conversation Mrs. Chickerel said, 'You say you want to ask
      me something?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes: but nothing of importance, mother. I was thinking about Picotee, and
      what would be the best thing to do-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, well you may, Berta. I am so uneasy about this life you have led us
      into, and full of fear that your plans may break down; if they do,
      whatever will become of us? I know you are doing your best; but I cannot
      help thinking that the coming to London and living with you was wild and
      rash, and not well weighed afore we set about it. You should have counted
      the cost first, and not advised it. If you break down, and we are all
      discovered living so queer and unnatural, right in the heart of the
      aristocracy, we should be the laughing-stock of the country: it would kill
      me, and ruin us all-utterly ruin us!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O mother, I know all that so well!' exclaimed Ethelberta, tears of
      anguish filling her eyes. 'Don't depress me more than I depress myself by
      such fears, or you will bring about the very thing we strive to avoid! My
      only chance is in keeping in good spirits, and why don't you try to help
      me a little by taking a brighter view of things?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I know I ought to, my dear girl, but I cannot. I do so wish that I never
      let you tempt me and the children away from the Lodge. I cannot think why
      I allowed myself to be so persuaded-cannot think! You are not to blame-it
      is I. I am much older than you, and ought to have known better than listen
      to such a scheme. This undertaking seems too big-the bills frighten me. I
      have never been used to such wild adventure, and I can't sleep at night
      for fear that your tale-telling will go wrong, and we shall all be exposed
      and shamed. A story-teller seems such an impossible castle-in-the-air sort
      of a trade for getting a living by-I cannot think how ever you came to
      dream of such an unheard-of thing.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But it is not a castle in the air, and it does get a living!' said
      Ethelberta, her lip quivering.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, yes, while it is just a new thing; but I am afraid it cannot
      last-that's what I fear. People will find you out as one of a family of
      servants, and their pride will be stung at having gone to hear your
      romancing; then they will go no more, and what will happen to us and the
      poor little ones?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'We must all scatter again!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If we could get as we were once, I wouldn't mind that. But we shall have
      lost our character as simple country folk who know nothing, which are the
      only class of poor people that squires will give any help to; and I much
      doubt if the girls would get places after such a discovery-it would be so
      awkward and unheard-of.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, all I can say is,' replied Ethelberta, 'that I will do my best. All
      that I have is theirs and yours as much as mine, and these arrangements
      are simply on their account. I don't like my relations being my servants;
      but if they did not work for me, they would have to work for others, and
      my service is much lighter and pleasanter than any other lady's would be
      for them, so the advantages are worth the risk. If I stood alone, I would
      go and hide my head in any hole, and care no more about the world and its
      ways. I wish I was well out of it, and at the bottom of a quiet
      grave-anybody might have the world for me then! But don't let me disturb
      you longer; it is getting late.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta then wished her mother good-night, and went away. To attempt
      confidences on such an ethereal matter as love was now absurd; her hermit
      spirit was doomed to dwell apart as usual; and she applied herself to deep
      thinking without aid and alone. Not only was there Picotee's misery to
      disperse; it became imperative to consider how best to overpass a more
      general catastrophe.

      24. ETHELBERTA'S HOUSE (continued)-THE BRITISH MUSEUM
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mrs. Chickerel, in deploring the risks of their present speculative mode
      of life, was far from imagining that signs of the foul future so much
      dreaded were actually apparent to Ethelberta at the time the lament was
      spoken. Hence the daughter's uncommon sensitiveness to prophecy. It was as
      if a dead-reckoner poring over his chart should predict breakers ahead to
      one who already beheld them.
    </p>
    <p>
      That her story-telling would prove so attractive Ethelberta had not
      ventured to expect for a moment; that having once proved attractive there
      should be any falling-off until such time had elapsed as would enable her
      to harvest some solid fruit was equally a surprise. Future expectations
      are often based without hesitation upon one happy accident, when the only
      similar condition remaining to subsequent sets of circumstances is that
      the same person forms the centre of them. Her situation was so peculiar,
      and so unlike that of most public people, that there was hardly an
      argument explaining this triumphant opening which could be used in
      forecasting the close; unless, indeed, more strategy were employed in the
      conduct of the campaign than Ethelberta seemed to show at present.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no denying that she commanded less attention than at first: the
      audience had lessened, and, judging by appearances, might soon be expected
      to be decidedly thin. In excessive lowness of spirit, Ethelberta
      translated these signs with the bias that a lingering echo of her mother's
      dismal words naturally induced, reading them as conclusive evidence that
      her adventure had been chimerical in its birth. Yet it was very far less
      conclusive than she supposed. Public interest might without doubt have
      been renewed after a due interval, some of the falling-off being only an
      accident of the season. Her novelties had been hailed with pleasure, the
      rather that their freshness tickled than that their intrinsic merit was
      appreciated; and, like many inexperienced dispensers of a unique charm,
      Ethelberta, by bestowing too liberally and too frequently, was destroying
      the very element upon which its popularity depended. Her entertainment had
      been good in its conception, and partly good in its execution; yet her
      success had but little to do with that goodness. Indeed, what might be
      called its badness in a histrionic sense-that is, her look sometimes of
      being out of place, the sight of a beautiful woman on a platform,
      revealing tender airs of domesticity which showed her to belong by
      character to a quiet drawing-room-had been primarily an attractive
      feature. But alas, custom was staling this by improving her up to the mark
      of an utter impersonator, thereby eradicating the pretty abashments of a
      poetess out of her sphere; and more than one well-wisher who observed
      Ethelberta from afar feared that it might some day come to be said of her
      that she had
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    'Enfeoffed herself to popularity:
    That, being daily swallowed by men's eyes,
    They surfeited with honey, and began
    To loathe the taste of sweetness, whereof a little
    More than a little is by much too much.'
</pre>
    <p>
      But this in its extremity was not quite yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      We discover her one day, a little after this time, sitting before a table
      strewed with accounts and bills from different tradesmen of the
      neighbourhood, which she examined with a pale face, collecting their
      totals on a blank sheet. Picotee came into the room, but Ethelberta took
      no notice whatever of her. The younger sister, who subsisted on scraps of
      notice and favour, like a dependent animal, even if these were only an
      occasional glance of the eye, could not help saying at last, 'Berta, how
      silent you are. I don't think you know I am in the room.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I did not observe you,' said Ethelberta. 'I am very much engaged: these
      bills have to be paid.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What, and cannot we pay them?' said Picotee, in vague alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O yes, I can pay them. The question is, how long shall I be able to do
      it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That is sad; and we are going on so nicely, too. It is not true that you
      have really decided to leave off story-telling now the people don't crowd
      to hear it as they did?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I think I shall leave off.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And begin again next year?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That is very doubtful.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll tell you what you might do,' said Picotee, her face kindling with a
      sense of great originality. 'You might travel about to country towns and
      tell your story splendidly.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A man in my position might perhaps do it with impunity; but I could not
      without losing ground in other domains. A woman may drive to Mayfair from
      her house in Exonbury Crescent, and speak from a platform there, and be
      supposed to do it as an original way of amusing herself; but when it comes
      to starring in the provinces she establishes herself as a woman of a
      different breed and habit. I wish I were a man! I would give up this
      house, advertise it to be let furnished, and sally forth with confidence.
      But I am driven to think of other ways to manage than that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Picotee fell into a conjectural look, but could not guess.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The way of marriage,' said Ethelberta. 'Otherwise perhaps the poetess may
      live to become what Dryden called himself when he got old and poor-a
      rent-charge on Providence. . . . . Yes, I must try that way,' she
      continued, with a sarcasm towards people out of hearing. I must buy a
      "Peerage" for one thing, and a "Baronetage," and a "House of Commons," and
      a "Landed Gentry," and learn what people are about me. 'I must go to
      Doctors' Commons and read up wills of the parents of any likely gudgeons I
      may know. I must get a Herald to invent an escutcheon of my family, and
      throw a genealogical tree into the bargain in consideration of my taking a
      few second-hand heirlooms of a pawnbroking friend of his. I must get up
      sham ancestors, and find out some notorious name to start my pedigree
      from. It does not matter what his character was; either villain or martyr
      will do, provided that he lived five hundred years ago. It would be
      considered far more creditable to make good my descent from Satan in the
      age when he went to and fro on the earth than from a ministering angel
      under Victoria.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But, Berta, you are not going to marry any stranger who may turn up?'
      said Picotee, who had creeping sensations of dread when Ethelberta talked
      like this.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I had no such intention. But, having once put my hand to the plough, how
      shall I turn back?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You might marry Mr. Ladywell,' said Picotee, who preferred to look at
      things in the concrete.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, marry him villainously; in cold blood, without a moment to prepare
      himself.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, you won't!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am not so sure about that. I have brought mother and the children to
      town against her judgment and against my father's; they gave way to my
      opinion as to one who from superior education has larger knowledge of the
      world than they. I must prove my promises, even if Heaven should fall upon
      me for it, or what a miserable future will theirs be! We must not be poor
      in London. Poverty in the country is a sadness, but poverty in town is a
      horror. There is something not without grandeur in the thought of
      starvation on an open mountain or in a wide wood, and your bones lying
      there to bleach in the pure sun and rain; but a back garret in a rookery,
      and the other starvers in the room insisting on keeping the window
      shut-anything to deliver us from that!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How gloomy you can be, Berta! It will never be so dreadful. Why, I can
      take in plain sewing, and you can do translations, and mother can knit
      stockings, and so on. How much longer will this house be yours?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Two years. If I keep it longer than that I shall have to pay rent at the
      rate of three hundred a year. The Petherwin estate provides me with it
      till then, which will be the end of Lady Petherwin's term.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I see it; and you ought to marry before the house is gone, if you mean to
      marry high,' murmured Picotee, in an inadequate voice, as one confronted
      by a world so tragic that any hope of her assisting therein was out of the
      question.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not long after this exposition of the family affairs that
      Christopher called upon them; but Picotee was not present, having gone to
      think of superhuman work on the spur of Ethelberta's awakening talk. There
      was something new in the way in which Ethelberta received the announcement
      of his name; passion had to do with it, so had circumspection; the latter
      most, for the first time since their reunion.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am going to leave this part of England,' said Christopher, after a few
      gentle preliminaries. 'I was one of the applicants for the post of
      assistant-organist at Melchester Cathedral when it became vacant, and I
      find I am likely to be chosen, through the interest of one of my father's
      friends.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I congratulate you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, Ethelberta, it is not worth that. I did not originally mean to follow
      this course at all; but events seemed to point to it in the absence of a
      better.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I too am compelled to follow a course I did not originally mean to take.'
      After saying no more for a few moments, she added, in a tone of sudden
      openness, a richer tincture creeping up her cheek, 'I want to put a
      question to you boldly-not exactly a question-a thought. Have you
      considered whether the relations between us which have lately prevailed
      are-are the best for you-and for me?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I know what you mean,' said Christopher, hastily anticipating all that
      she might be going to say; 'and I am glad you have given me the
      opportunity of speaking upon that subject. It has been very good and
      considerate in you to allow me to share your society so frequently as you
      have done since I have been in town, and to think of you as an object to
      exist for and strive for. But I ought to have remembered that, since you
      have nobody at your side to look after your interests, it behoved me to be
      doubly careful. In short, Ethelberta, I am not in a position to marry, nor
      can I discern when I shall be, and I feel it would be an injustice to ask
      you to be bound in any way to one lower and less talented than you. You
      cannot, from what you say, think it desirable that the engagement should
      continue. I have no right to ask you to be my betrothed, without having a
      near prospect of making you my wife. I don't mind saying this straight
      out-I have no fear that you will doubt my love; thank Heaven, you know
      what that is well enough! However, as things are, I wish you to know that
      I cannot conscientiously put in a claim upon your attention.'
    </p>
    <p>
      A second meaning was written in Christopher's look, though he scarcely
      uttered it. A woman so delicately poised upon the social globe could not
      in honour be asked to wait for a lover who was unable to set bounds to the
      waiting period. Yet he had privily dreamed of an approach to that
      position-an unreserved, ideally perfect declaration from Ethelberta that
      time and practical issues were nothing to her; that she would stand as
      fast without material hopes as with them; that love was to be an end with
      her henceforth, having utterly ceased to be a means. Therefore this
      surreptitious hope of his, founded on no reasonable expectation, was like
      a guilty thing surprised when Ethelberta answered, with a predominance of
      judgment over passion still greater than before:
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is unspeakably generous in you to put it all before me so nicely,
      Christopher. I think infinitely more of you for being so unreserved,
      especially since I too have been thinking much on the indefiniteness of
      the days to come. We are not numbered among the blest few who can afford
      to trifle with the time. Yet to agree to anything like a positive parting
      will be quite unnecessary. You did not mean that, did you? for it is harsh
      if you did.' Ethelberta smiled kindly as she said this, as much as to say
      that she was far from really upbraiding him. 'Let it be only that we will
      see each other less. We will bear one another in mind as deeply attached
      friends if not as definite lovers, and keep up friendly remembrances of a
      sort which, come what may, will never have to be ended by any painful
      process termed breaking off. Different persons, different natures; and it
      may be that marriage would not be the most favourable atmosphere for our
      old affection to prolong itself in. When do you leave London?'
    </p>
    <p>
      The disconnected query seemed to be subjoined to disperse the crude effect
      of what had gone before.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I hardly know,' murmured Christopher. 'I suppose I shall not call here
      again.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst they were silent somebody entered the room softly, and they turned
      to discover Picotee.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Come here, Picotee,' said Ethelberta.
    </p>
    <p>
      Picotee came with an abashed bearing to where the other two were standing,
      and looked down steadfastly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr. Julian is going away,' she continued, with determined firmness. 'He
      will not see us again for a long time.' And Ethelberta added, in a lower
      tone, though still in the unflinching manner of one who had set herself to
      say a thing, and would say it-'He is not to be definitely engaged to me
      any longer. We are not thinking of marrying, you know, Picotee. It is best
      that we should not.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Perhaps it is,' said Christopher hurriedly, taking up his hat. 'Let me
      now wish you good-bye; and, of course, you will always know where I am,
      and how to find me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a tender time. He inclined forward that Ethelberta might give him
      her hand, which she did; whereupon their eyes met. Mastered by an
      impelling instinct she had not reckoned with, Ethelberta presented her
      cheek. Christopher kissed it faintly. Tears were in Ethelberta's eyes now,
      and she was heartfull of many emotions. Placing her arm round Picotee's
      waist, who had never lifted her eyes from the carpet, she drew the slight
      girl forward, and whispered quickly to him-'Kiss her, too. She is my
      sister, and I am yours.'
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed all right and natural to their respective moods and the tone of
      the moment that free old Wessex manners should prevail, and Christopher
      stooped and dropped upon Picotee's cheek likewise such a farewell kiss as
      he had imprinted upon Ethelberta's.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Care for us both equally!' said Ethelberta.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will,' said Christopher, scarcely knowing what he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had reached the door of the room, he looked back and saw the two
      sisters standing as he had left them, and equally tearful. Ethelberta at
      once said, in a last futile struggle against letting him go altogether,
      and with thoughts of her sister's heart:
    </p>
    <p>
      'I think that Picotee might correspond with Faith; don't you, Mr. Julian?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'My sister would much like to do so,' said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And you would like it too, would you not, Picotee?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O yes,' she replied. 'And I can tell them all about you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then it shall be so, if Miss Julian will.' She spoke in a settled way, as
      if something intended had been set in train; and Christopher having
      promised for his sister, he went out of the house with a parting smile of
      misgiving.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could scarcely believe as he walked along that those late words, yet
      hanging in his ears, had really been spoken, that still visible scene
      enacted. He could not even recollect for a minute or two how the final
      result had been produced. Did he himself first enter upon the long-looming
      theme, or did she? Christopher had been so nervously alive to the urgency
      of setting before the hard-striving woman a clear outline of himself, his
      surroundings and his fears, that he fancied the main impulse to this
      consummation had been his, notwithstanding that a faint initiative had
      come from Ethelberta. All had completed itself quickly, unceremoniously,
      and easily. Ethelberta had let him go a second time; yet on foregoing
      mornings and evenings, when contemplating the necessity of some such
      explanation, it had seemed that nothing less than Atlantean force could
      overpower their mutual gravitation towards each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his reaching home Faith was not in the house, and, in the restless
      state which demands something to talk at, the musician went off to find
      her, well knowing her haunt at this time of the day. He entered the spiked
      and gilded gateway of the Museum hard by, turned to the wing devoted to
      sculptures, and descended to a particular basement room, which was lined
      with bas-reliefs from Nineveh. The place was cool, silent, and soothing;
      it was empty, save of a little figure in black, that was standing with its
      face to the wall in an innermost nook. This spot was Faith's own temple;
      here, among these deserted antiques, Faith was always happy. Christopher
      looked on at her for some time before she noticed him, and dimly perceived
      how vastly differed her homely suit and unstudied contour-painfully
      unstudied to fastidious eyes-from Ethelberta's well-arranged draperies,
      even from Picotee's clever bits of ribbon, by which she made herself look
      pretty out of nothing at all. Yet this negligence was his sister's
      essence; without it she would have been a spoilt product. She had no outer
      world, and her rusty black was as appropriate to Faith's unseen courses as
      were Ethelberta's correct lights and shades to her more prominent career.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Look, Kit,' said Faith, as soon as she knew who was approaching. 'This is
      a thing I never learnt before; this person is really Sennacherib, sitting
      on his throne; and these with fluted beards and hair like plough-furrows,
      and fingers with no bones in them, are his warriors-really carved at the
      time, you know. Only just think that this is not imagined of Assyria, but
      done in Assyrian times by Assyrian hands. Don't you feel as if you were
      actually in Nineveh; that as we now walk between these slabs, so walked
      Ninevites between them once?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. . . . Faith, it is all over. Ethelberta and I have parted.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Indeed. And so my plan is to think of verses in the Bible about
      Sennacherib and his doings, which resemble these; this verse, for
      instance, I remember: "Now in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah did
      Sennacherib, King of Assyria, come up against all the fenced cities of
      Judah and took them. And Hezekiah, King of Judah, sent to the King of
      Assyria to Lachish," and so on. Well, there it actually is, you see.
      There's Sennacherib, and there's Lachish. Is it not glorious to think that
      this is a picture done at the time of those very events?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. We did not quarrel this time, Ethelberta and I. If I may so put it,
      it is worse than quarrelling. We felt it was no use going on any longer,
      and so-Come, Faith, hear what I say, or else tell me that you won't hear,
      and that I may as well save my breath!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, I will really listen,' she said, fluttering her eyelids in her
      concern at having been so abstracted, and excluding Sennacherib there and
      then from Christopher's affairs by the first settlement of her features to
      a present-day aspect, and her eyes upon his face. 'You said you had seen
      Ethelberta. Yes, and what did she say?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Was there ever anybody so provoking! Why, I have just told you!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, yes; I remember now. You have parted. The subject is too large for
      me to know all at once what I think of it, and you must give me time, Kit.
      Speaking of Ethelberta reminds me of what I have done. I just looked into
      the Academy this morning-I thought I would surprise you by telling you
      about it. And what do you think I saw? Ethelberta-in the picture painted
      by Mr. Ladywell.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is never hung?' said he, feeling that they were at one as to a topic
      at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. And the subject is an Elizabethan knight parting from a lady of the
      same period-the words explaining the picture being-
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    "Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,
    And like enough thou know'st thy estimate."
</pre>
    <p>
      The lady is Ethelberta, to the shade of a hair-her living face; and the
      knight is-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not Ladywell?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I think so; I am not sure.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No wonder I am dismissed! And yet she hates him. Well, come along, Faith.
      Women allow strange liberties in these days.'

    <h2>
      25. THE ROYAL ACADEMY-THE FARNFIELD ESTATE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Ethelberta was a firm believer in the kindly effects of artistic education
      upon the masses. She held that defilement of mind often arose from
      ignorance of eye; and her philanthropy being, by the simple force of her
      situation, of that sort which lingers in the neighbourhood of home, she
      concentrated her efforts in this kind upon Sol and Dan. Accordingly, the
      Academy exhibition having now just opened, she ordered the brothers to
      appear in their best clothes at the entrance to Burlington House just
      after noontide on the Saturday of the first week, this being the only day
      and hour at which they could attend without 'losing a half' and therefore
      it was necessary to put up with the inconvenience of arriving at a crowded
      and enervating time.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Ethelberta was set down in the quadrangle she perceived the faithful
      pair, big as the Zamzummims of old time, standing like sentinels in the
      particular corner that she had named to them: for Sol and Dan would as
      soon have attempted petty larceny as broken faith with their admired
      lady-sister Ethelberta. They welcomed her with a painfully lavish
      exhibition of large new gloves, and chests covered with broad triangular
      areas of padded blue silk, occupying the position that the shirt-front had
      occupied in earlier days, and supposed to be lineally descended from the
      tie of a neckerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dress of their sister for to-day was exactly that of a respectable
      workman's relative who had no particular ambition in the matter of
      fashion-a black stuff gown, a plain bonnet to match. A veil she wore for
      obvious reasons: her face was getting well known in London, and it had
      already appeared at the private view in an uncovered state, when it was
      scrutinized more than the paintings around. But now homely and useful
      labour was her purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Catalogue in hand she took the two brothers through the galleries,
      teaching them in whispers as they walked, and occasionally correcting
      them-first, for too reverential a bearing towards the well-dressed crowd,
      among whom they persisted in walking with their hats in their hands and
      with the contrite bearing of meek people in church; and, secondly, for a
      tendency which they too often showed towards straying from the
      contemplation of the pictures as art to indulge in curious speculations on
      the intrinsic nature of the delineated subject, the gilding of the frames,
      the construction of the skylights overhead, or admiration for the
      bracelets, lockets, and lofty eloquence of persons around them.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now,' said Ethelberta, in a warning whisper, 'we are coming near the
      picture which was partly painted from myself. And, Dan, when you see it,
      don't you exclaim "Hullo!" or "That's Berta to a T," or anything at all.
      It would not matter were it not dangerous for me to be noticed here
      to-day. I see several people who would recognize me on the least
      provocation.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not a word,' said Dan. 'Don't you be afeard about that. I feel that I
      baint upon my own ground to-day; and wouldn't do anything to cause an
      upset, drown me if I would. Would you, Sol?'
    </p>
    <p>
      In this temper they all pressed forward, and Ethelberta could not but be
      gratified at the reception of Ladywell's picture, though it was accorded
      by critics not very profound. It was an operation of some minutes to get
      exactly opposite, and when side by side the three stood there they
      overheard the immediate reason of the pressure. 'Farewell, thou art too
      dear for my possessing' had been lengthily discoursed upon that morning by
      the Coryphaeus of popular opinion; and the spirit having once been poured
      out sons and daughters could prophesy. But, in truth, Ladywell's work, if
      not emphatically original, was happily centred on a middle stratum of
      taste, and apart from this adventitious help commanded, and deserved to
      command, a wide area of appreciation.
    </p>
    <p>
      While they were standing here in the very heart of the throng Ethelberta's
      ears were arrested by two male voices behind her, whose words formed a
      novel contrast to those of the other speakers around.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Some men, you see, with extravagant expectations of themselves, coolly
      get them gratified, while others hope rationally and are disappointed.
      Luck, that's what it is. And the more easily a man takes life the more
      persistently does luck follow him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of course; because, if he's industrious he does not want luck's
      assistance. Natural laws will help him instead.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, if it is true that Ladywell has painted a good picture he has done
      it by an exhaustive process. He has painted every possible bad one till
      nothing more of that sort is left for him. You know what lady's face
      served as the original to this, I suppose?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mrs. Petherwin's, I hear.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, Mrs. Alfred Neigh that's to be.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What, that elusive fellow caught at last?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'So it appears; but she herself is hardly so well secured as yet, it
      seems, though he takes the uncertainty as coolly as possible. I knew
      nothing about it till he introduced the subject as we were standing here
      on Monday, and said, in an off-hand way, "I mean to marry that lady." I
      asked him how. "Easily," he said; "I will have her if there are a hundred
      at her heels." You will understand that this was quite in confidence.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of course, of course.' Then there was a slight laugh, and the companions
      proceeded to other gossip.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta, calm and compressed in manner, sidled along to extricate
      herself, not daring to turn round, and Dan and Sol followed, till they
      were all clear of the spot. The brothers, who had heard the words equally
      well with Ethelberta, made no remark to her upon them, assuming that they
      referred to some peculiar system of courtship adopted in high life, with
      which they had rightly no concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta ostensibly continued her business of tutoring the young workmen
      just as before, though every emotion in her had been put on the alert by
      this discovery. She had known that Neigh admired her; yet his presumption
      in uttering such a remark as he was reported to have uttered,
      confidentially or otherwise, nearly took away her breath. Perhaps it was
      not altogether disagreeable to have her breath so taken away.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I mean to marry that lady.' She whispered the words to herself twenty
      times in the course of the afternoon. Sol and Dan were left considerably
      longer to their private perceptions of the false and true in art than they
      had been earlier in the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she reached home Ethelberta was still far removed in her reflections;
      and it was noticed afterwards that about this time in her career her
      openness of manner entirely deserted her. She mostly was silent as to her
      thoughts, and she wore an air of unusual stillness. It was the silence and
      stillness of a starry sky, where all is force and motion. This deep
      undecipherable habit sometimes suggested, though it did not reveal,
      Ethelberta's busy brain to her sisters, and they said to one another, 'I
      cannot think what's coming to Berta: she is not so nice as she used to
      be.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening under notice was passed desultorily enough after the discovery
      of Neigh's self-assured statement. Among other things that she did after
      dark, while still musingly examining the probabilities of the report
      turning out true, was to wander to the large attic where the children
      slept, a frequent habit of hers at night, to learn if they were snug and
      comfortable. They were talking now from bed to bed, the person under
      discussion being herself. Herself seemed everywhere to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I know that she is a fairy,' Myrtle was insisting, 'because she must be,
      to have such pretty things in her house, and wear silk dresses such as
      mother and we and Picotee haven't got, and have money to give us whenever
      we want it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Emmeline says perhaps she knows the fairy's godmother, and is not a fairy
      herself, because Berta is too tall for a real fairy.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She must be one; for when there was a notch burnt in the hem of my pretty
      blue frock she said it should be gone in the morning if I would go to bed
      and not cry; and in the morning it was gone, and all nice and straight as
      new.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta was recalling to mind how she had sat up and repaired the
      damage alluded to by cutting off half an inch of the skirt all round and
      hemming it anew, when the breathing of the children became regular, and
      they fell asleep. Here were bright little minds ready for a training,
      which without money and influence she could never give them. The wisdom
      which knowledge brings, and the power which wisdom may bring, she had
      always assumed would be theirs in her dreams for their social elevation.
      By what means were these things to be ensured to them if her skill in
      bread-winning should fail her? Would not a well-contrived marriage be of
      service? She covered and tucked in one more closely, lifted another upon
      the pillow and straightened the soft limbs to an easy position; then sat
      down by the window and looked out at the flashing stars. Thoughts of
      Neigh's audacious statement returned again upon Ethelberta. He had said
      that he meant to marry her. Of what standing was the man who had uttered
      such an intention respecting one to whom a politic marriage had become
      almost a necessity of existence?
    </p>
    <p>
      She had often heard Neigh speak indefinitely of some estate-'my little
      place' he had called it-which he had purchased no very long time ago. All
      she knew was that its name was Farnfield, that it lay thirty or forty
      miles out of London in a south-westerly direction, a railway station in
      the district bearing the same name, so that there was probably a village
      or small town adjoining. Whether the dignity of this landed property was
      that of domain, farmstead, allotment, or garden-plot, Ethelberta had not
      the slightest conception. She was almost certain that Neigh never lived
      there, but that might signify nothing. The exact size and value of the
      estate would, she mused, be curious, interesting, and almost necessary
      information to her who must become mistress of it were she to allow him to
      carry out his singularly cool and crude, if tender, intention. Moreover,
      its importance would afford a very good random sample of his worldly
      substance throughout, from which alone, after all, could the true spirit
      and worth and seriousness of his words be apprehended. Impecuniosity may
      revel in unqualified vows and brim over with confessions as blithely as a
      bird of May, but such careless pleasures are not for the solvent, whose
      very dreams are negotiable, and are expressed with due care accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      That Neigh had used the words she had far more than prima-facie
      appearances for believing. Neigh's own conduct towards her, though
      peculiar rather than devoted, found in these words alone a reasonable key.
      But, supposing the estate to be such a verbal hallucination as, for
      instance, hers had been at Arrowthorne, when her poor, unprogressive,
      hopelessly impracticable Christopher came there to visit her, and was so
      wonderfully undeceived about her social standing: what a fiasco, and what
      a cuckoo-cry would his utterances about marriage seem then. Christopher
      had often told her of his expectations from 'Arrowthorne Lodge,' and of
      the blunders that had resulted in consequence. Had not Ethelberta's
      affection for Christopher partaken less of lover's passion than of
      old-established tutelary tenderness she might have been reminded by this
      reflection of the transcendent fidelity he had shown under that trial-as
      severe a trial, considering the abnormal, almost morbid, development of
      the passion for position in present-day society, as can be prepared for
      men who move in the ordinary, unheroic channels of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the following evening the consideration of this possibility, that
      Neigh's position might furnish scope for such a disillusive discovery by
      herself as hers had afforded to Christopher, decoyed Ethelberta into a
      curious little scheme. She was piqued into a practical undertaking by the
      man who could say to his friend with such sangfroid, 'I mean to marry that
      lady.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Merely telling Picotee to prepare for an evening excursion, of which she
      was to talk to no one, Ethelberta made ready likewise, and they left the
      house in a cab about half-an-hour before sunset, and drove to the Waterloo
      Station.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the decline and departure of the sun a fog gathered itself out of the
      low meadow-land that bordered the railway as they went along towards the
      west, stretching over it like a placid lake, till at the end of the
      journey, the mist became generally pervasive, though not dense. Avoiding
      observation as much as they conveniently could, the two sisters walked
      from the long wooden shed which formed the station here, into the rheumy
      air and along the road to the open country. Picotee occasionally
      questioned Ethelberta on the object of the strange journey: she did not
      question closely, being satisfied that in such sure hands as Ethelberta's
      she was safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deeming it unwise to make any inquiry just yet beyond the simple one of
      the way to Farnfield, Ethelberta led her companion along a newly-fenced
      road across a heath. In due time they came to an ornamental gate with a
      curved sweep of wall on each side, signifying the entrance to some
      enclosed property or other. Ethelberta, being quite free from any digested
      plan for encouraging Neigh in his resolve to wive, was startled to find a
      hope in her that this very respectable beginning before their eyes was the
      entrance to the Farnfield property: that she hoped it was nevertheless
      unquestionable. Just beyond lay a turnpike-house, where was dimly visible
      a woman in the act of putting up a shutter to the front window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Compelled by this time to come to special questions, Ethelberta instructed
      Picotee to ask of this person if the place they had just passed was the
      entrance to Farnfield Park. The woman replied that it was. Directly she
      had gone indoors Ethelberta turned back again towards the park gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What have we come for, Berta?' said Picotee, as she turned also.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll tell you some day,' replied her sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now much past eight o'clock, and, from the nature of the evening,
      dusk. The last stopping up-train was about ten, so that half-an-hour could
      well be afforded for looking round. Ethelberta went to the gate, which was
      found to be fastened by a chain and padlock.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, the London season,' she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a wicket at the side, and they entered. An avenue of young fir
      trees three or four feet in height extended from the gate into the mist,
      and down this they walked. The drive was not in very good order, and the
      two women were frequently obliged to walk on the grass to avoid the rough
      stones in the carriage-way. The double line of young firs now abruptly
      terminated, and the road swept lower, bending to the right, immediately in
      front being a large lake, calm and silent as a second sky. They could hear
      from somewhere on the margin the purl of a weir, and around were clumps of
      shrubs, araucarias and deodars being the commonest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta could not resist being charmed with the repose of the spot, and
      hastened on with curiosity to reach the other side of the pool, where, by
      every law of manorial topography, the mansion would be situate. The fog
      concealed all objects beyond a distance of twenty yards or thereabouts,
      but it was nearly full moon, and though the orb was hidden, a pale
      diffused light enabled them to see objects in the foreground. Reaching the
      other side of the lake the drive enlarged itself most legitimately to a
      large oval, as for a sweep before a door, a pile of rockwork standing in
      the midst.
    </p>
    <p>
      But where should have been the front door of a mansion was simply a rough
      rail fence, about four feet high. They drew near and looked over.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the enclosure, and on the site of the imaginary house, was an
      extraordinary group. It consisted of numerous horses in the last stage of
      decrepitude, the animals being such mere skeletons that at first
      Ethelberta hardly recognized them to be horses at all; they seemed rather
      to be specimens of some attenuated heraldic animal, scarcely thick enough
      through the body to throw a shadow: or enlarged castings of the fire-dog
      of past times. These poor creatures were endeavouring to make a meal from
      herbage so trodden and thin that scarcely a wholesome blade remained; the
      little that there was consisted of the sourer sorts common on such sandy
      soils, mingled with tufts of heather and sprouting ferns.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why have we come here, dear Berta?' said Picotee, shuddering.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I hardly know,' said Ethelberta.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adjoining this enclosure was another and smaller one, formed of high
      boarding, within which appeared to be some sheds and outhouses. Ethelberta
      looked through the crevices, and saw that in the midst of the yard stood
      trunks of trees as if they were growing, with branches also extending, but
      these were sawn off at the points where they began to be flexible, no
      twigs or boughs remaining. Each torso was not unlike a huge hat-stand, and
      suspended to the pegs and prongs were lumps of some substance which at
      first she did not recognize; they proved to be a chronological sequel to
      the previous scene. Horses' skulls, ribs, quarters, legs, and other joints
      were hung thereon, the whole forming a huge open-air larder emitting not
      too sweet a smell.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what Stygian sound was this? There had arisen at the moment upon the
      mute and sleepy air a varied howling from a hundred tongues. It had burst
      from a spot close at hand-a low wooden building by a stream which fed the
      lake-and reverberated for miles. No further explanation was required.
    </p>
    <p>
      'We are close to a kennel of hounds,' said Ethelberta, as Picotee held
      tightly to her arm. 'They cannot get out, so you need not fear. They have
      a horrid way of suddenly beginning thus at different hours of the night,
      for no apparent reason: though perhaps they hear us. These poor horses are
      waiting to be killed for their food.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The experience altogether, from its intense melancholy, was very
      depressing, almost appalling to the two lone young women, and they quickly
      retraced their footsteps. The pleasant lake, the purl of the weir, the
      rudimentary lawns, shrubberies, and avenue, had changed their character
      quite. Ethelberta fancied at that moment that she could not have married
      Neigh, even had she loved him, so horrid did his belongings appear to be.
      But for many other reasons she had been gradually feeling within this hour
      that she would not go out of her way at a beck from a man whose interest
      was so unimpassioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thinking no more of him as a possible husband she ceased to be afraid to
      make inquiries about the peculiarities of his possessions. In the
      high-road they came on a local man, resting from wheeling a wheelbarrow,
      and Ethelberta asked him, with the air of a countrywoman, who owned the
      estate across the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The man owning that is one of the name of Neigh,' said the native, wiping
      his face. ''Tis a family that have made a very large fortune by the
      knacker business and tanning, though they be only sleeping partners in it
      now, and live like lords. Mr. Neigh was going to pull down the old huts
      here, and improve the place and build a mansion-in short, he went so far
      as to have the grounds planted, and the roads marked out, and the
      fish-pond made, and the place christened Farnfield Park; but he did no
      more. "I shall never have a wife," he said, "so why should I want a house
      to put her in?" He's a terrible hater of women, I hear, particularly the
      lower class.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Indeed!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, and since then he has let half the land to the Honourable Mr.
      Mountclere, a brother of Lord Mountclere's. Mr. Mountclere wanted the spot
      for a kennel, and as the land is too poor and sandy for cropping, Mr.
      Neigh let him have it. 'Tis his hounds that you hear howling.'
    </p>
    <p>
      They passed on. 'Berta, why did we come down here?' said Picotee.
    </p>
    <p>
      'To see the nakedness of the land. It was a whim only, and as it will end
      in nothing, it is not worth while for me to make further explanation.'
    </p>
    <p>
      It was with a curious sense of renunciation that Ethelberta went homeward.
      Neigh was handsome, grim-natured, rather wicked, and an indifferentist;
      and these attractions interested her as a woman. But the news of this
      evening suggested to Ethelberta that herself and Neigh were too nearly
      cattle of one colour for a confession on the matter of lineage to be well
      received by him; and without confidence of every sort on the nature of her
      situation, she was determined to contract no union at all. The sympathy of
      unlikeness might lead the scion of some family, hollow and fungous with
      antiquity, and as yet unmarked by a mesalliance, to be won over by her
      story; but the antipathy of resemblance would be ineradicable.

    <h2>
      26. ETHELBERTA'S DRAWING-ROOM
    </h2>
    <p>
      While Ethelberta during the next few days was dismissing that evening
      journey from her consideration, as an incident altogether foreign to the
      organized course of her existence, the hidden fruit thereof was rounding
      to maturity in a species unforeseen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inferences unassailable as processes, are, nevertheless, to be suspected,
      from the almost certain deficiency of particulars on some side or other.
      The truth in relation to Neigh's supposed frigidity was brought before her
      at the end of the following week, when Dan and Sol had taken Picotee,
      Cornelia, and the young children to Kew for the afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early that morning, hours before it was necessary, there had been such a
      chatter of preparation in the house as was seldom heard there. Sunday hats
      and bonnets had been retrimmed with such cunning that it would have taken
      a milliner's apprentice at least to discover that any thread in them was
      not quite new. There was an anxious peep through the blind at the sky at
      daybreak by Georgina and Myrtle, and the perplexity of these rural
      children was great at the weather-signs of the town, where atmospheric
      effects had nothing to do with clouds, and fair days and foul came
      apparently quite by chance. Punctually at the hour appointed two friendly
      human shadows descended across the kitchen window, followed by Sol and
      Dan, much to the relief of the children's apprehensions that they might
      forget the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The brothers were by this time acquiring something of the airs and manners
      of London workmen; they were less spontaneous and more comparative; less
      genial, but smarter; in obedience to the usual law by which the emotion
      that takes the form of humour in country workmen becomes transmuted to
      irony among the same order in town. But the fixed and dogged fidelity to
      one another under apparent coolness, by which this family was
      distinguished, remained unshaken in these members as in all the rest,
      leading them to select the children as companions in their holiday in
      preference to casual acquaintance. At last they were ready, and departed,
      and Ethelberta, after chatting with her mother awhile, proceeded to her
      personal duties.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house was very silent that day, Gwendoline and Joey being the only
      ones left below stairs. Ethelberta was wishing that she had thrown off her
      state and gone to Kew to have an hour of childhood over again in a romp
      with the others, when she was startled by the announcement of a male
      visitor-none other than Mr. Neigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta's attitude on receipt of this information sufficiently
      expressed a revived sense that the incidence of Mr. Neigh on her path
      might have a meaning after all. Neigh had certainly said he was going to
      marry her, and now here he was come to her house-just as if he meant to do
      it forthwith. She had mentally discarded him; yet she felt a shock which
      was scarcely painful, and a dread which was almost exhilarating. Her
      flying visit to Farnfield she thought little of at this moment. From the
      fact that the mind prefers imaginings to recapitulation, conjecture to
      history, Ethelberta had dwelt more upon Neigh's possible plans and
      anticipations than upon the incidents of her evening journey; and the
      former assumed a more distinct shape in her mind's eye than anything on
      the visible side of the curtain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neigh was perhaps not quite so placidly nonchalant as in ordinary; still,
      he was by far the most trying visitor that Ethelberta had lately faced,
      and she could not get above the stage-not a very high one for the mistress
      of a house-of feeling her personality to be inconveniently in the way of
      his eyes. He had somewhat the bearing of a man who was going to do without
      any fuss what gushing people would call a philanthropic action.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have been intending to write a line to you,' said Neigh; 'but I felt
      that I could not be sure of writing my meaning in a way which might please
      you. I am not bright at a letter-never was. The question I mean is one
      that I hope you will be disposed to answer favourably, even though I may
      show the awkwardness of a fellow-person who has never put such a question
      before. Will you give me a word of encouragement-just a hope that I may
      not be unacceptable as a husband to you? Your talents are very great; and
      of course I know that I have nothing at all in that way. Still people are
      happy together sometimes in spite of such things. Will you say "Yes," and
      settle it now?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I was not expecting you had come upon such an errand as this,' said she,
      looking up a little, but mostly looking down. 'I cannot say what you wish,
      Mr. Neigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Perhaps I have been too sudden and presumptuous. Yes, I know I have been
      that. However, directly I saw you I felt that nobody ever came so near my
      idea of what is desirable in a lady, and it occurred to me that only one
      obstacle should stand in the way of the natural results, which obstacle
      would be your refusal. In common kindness consider. I daresay I am judged
      to be a man of inattentive habits-I know that's what you think of me; but
      under your influence I should be very different; so pray do not let your
      dislike to little matters influence you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I would not indeed. But believe me there can be no discussion of marriage
      between us,' said Ethelberta decisively.
    </p>
    <p>
      'If that's the case I may as well say no more. To burden you with my
      regrets would be out of place, I suppose,' said Neigh, looking calmly out
      of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Apart from personal feeling, there are considerations which would prevent
      what you contemplated,' she murmured. 'My affairs are too lengthy,
      intricate, and unpleasant for me to explain to anybody at present. And
      that would be a necessary first step.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not at all. I cannot think that preliminary to be necessary at all. I
      would put my lawyer in communication with yours, and we would leave the
      rest to them: I believe that is the proper way. You could say anything in
      confidence to your family-man; and you could inquire through him anything
      you might wish to know about my-about me. All you would need to say to
      myself are just the two little words-"I will," in the church here at the
      end of the Crescent.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am sorry to pain you, Mr. Neigh-so sorry,' said Ethelberta. 'But I
      cannot say them.' She was rather distressed that, despite her discouraging
      words, he still went on with his purpose, as if he imagined what she so
      distinctly said to be no bar, but rather a stimulant, usual under the
      circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It does not matter about paining me,' said Neigh. 'Don't take that into
      consideration at all. But I did not expect you to leave me so entirely
      without help-to refuse me absolutely as far as words go-after what you
      did. If it had not been for that I should never have ventured to call. I
      might otherwise have supposed your interest to be fixed in another
      quarter; but your acting in that manner encouraged me to think you could
      listen to a word.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What do you allude to?' said Ethelberta. 'How have I acted?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Neigh appeared reluctant to go any further; but the allusion soon became
      sufficiently clear. 'I wish my little place at Farnfield had been worthier
      of you,' he said brusquely. 'However, that's a matter of time only. It is
      useless to build a house there yet. I wish I had known that you would be
      looking over it at that time of the evening. A single word, when we were
      talking about it the other day, that you were going to be in the
      neighbourhood, would have been sufficient. Nothing could have given me so
      much delight as to have driven you round.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew that she had been to Farnfield: that knowledge was what had
      inspired him to call upon her to-day! Ethelberta breathed a sort of
      exclamation, not right out, but stealthily, like a parson's damn. Her face
      did not change, since a face must be said not to change while it preserves
      the same pleasant lines in the mobile parts as before; but anybody who has
      preserved his pleasant lines under the half-minute's peer of the invidious
      camera, and found what a wizened, starched kind of thing they stiffen to
      towards the end of the time, will understand the tendency of Ethelberta's
      lovely features now.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes; I walked round,' said Ethelberta faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neigh was decidedly master of the position at last; but he spoke as if he
      did not value that. His knowledge had furnished him with grounds for
      calling upon her, and he hastened to undeceive her from supposing that he
      could think ill of any motive of hers which gave him those desirable
      grounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I supposed you, by that, to give some little thought to me occasionally,'
      he resumed, in the same slow and orderly tone. 'How could I help thinking
      so? It was your doing that which encouraged me. Now, was it not natural-I
      put it to you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta was almost exasperated at perceiving the awful extent to which
      she had compromised herself with this man by her impulsive visit. Lightly
      and philosophically as he seemed to take it-as a thing, in short, which
      every woman would do by nature unless hindered by difficulties-it was no
      trifle to her as long as he was ignorant of her justification; and this
      she determined that he should know at once, at all hazards.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It was through you in the first place that I did look into your grounds!'
      she said excitedly. 'It was your presumption that caused me to go there. I
      should not have thought of such a thing else. If you had not said what you
      did say I never should have thought of you or Farnfield either-Farnfield
      might have been in Kamtschatka for all I cared.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I hope sincerely that I never said anything to disturb you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, you did-not to me, but to somebody,' said Ethelberta, with her eyes
      over-full of retained tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What have I said to somebody that can be in the least objectionable to
      you?' inquired Neigh, with much concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You said-you said, you meant to marry me-just as if I had no voice in the
      matter! And that annoyed me, and made me go there out of curiosity.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Neigh changed colour a little. 'Well, I did say it: I own that I said it,'
      he replied at last. Probably he knew enough of her nature not to feel long
      disconcerted by her disclosure, however she might have become possessed of
      the information. The explanation was certainly a great excuse to her
      curiosity; but if Ethelberta had tried she could not have given him a
      better ground for making light of her objections to his suit. 'I felt that
      I must marry you, that we were predestined to marry ages ago, and I feel
      it still!' he continued, with listless ardour. 'You seem to regret your
      interest in Farnfield; but to me it is a charm, and has been ever since I
      heard of it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If you only knew all!' she said helplessly, showing, without perceiving
      it, an unnecessary humility in the remark, since there was no more reason
      just then that she should go into details about her life than that he
      should about his. But melancholy and mistaken thoughts of herself as a
      counterfeit had brought her to this.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I do not wish to know more,' said Neigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And would you marry any woman off-hand, without being thoroughly
      acquainted with her circumstances?' she said, looking at him curiously,
      and with a little admiration, for his unconscionably phlegmatic treatment
      of her motives in going to Farnfield had a not unbecoming daring about it
      in Ethelberta's eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I would marry a woman off-hand when that woman is you. I would make you
      mine this moment did I dare; or, to speak with absolute accuracy, within
      twenty-four hours. Do assent to it, dear Mrs. Petherwin, and let me be
      sure of you for ever. I'll drive to Doctors' Commons this minute, and meet
      you to-morrow morning at nine in the church just below. It is a simple
      impulse, but I would adhere to it in the coolest moment. Shall it be
      arranged in that way, instead of our waiting through the ordinary routine
      of preparation? I am not a youth now, but I can see the bliss of such an
      act as that, and the contemptible nature of methodical proceedings beside
      it!'
    </p>
    <p>
      He had taken her hand. Ethelberta gave it a subtle movement backwards to
      imply that he was not to retain the prize, and said, 'One whose inner life
      is almost unknown to you, and whom you have scarcely seen except at other
      people's houses!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'We know each other far better than we may think at first,' said Neigh.
      'We are not people to love in a hurry, and I have not done so in this
      case. As for worldly circumstances, the most important items in a marriage
      contract are the persons themselves, and, as far as I am concerned, if I
      get a lady fair and wise I care for nothing further. I know you are
      beautiful, for all London owns it; I know you are talented, for I have
      read your poetry and heard your romances; and I know you are politic and
      discreet-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'For I have examined your property,' said she, with a weak smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neigh bowed. 'And what more can I wish to know? Come, shall it be?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Certainly not to-morrow.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I would be entirely in your hands in that matter. I will not urge you to
      be precipitate-I could not expect you to be ready yet. My suddenness
      perhaps offended you; but, having thought deeply of this bright
      possibility, I was apt to forget the forbearance that one ought to show at
      first in mentioning it. If I have done wrong forgive me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will think of that,' said Ethelberta, with a cooler manner. 'But
      seriously, all these words are nothing to the purpose. I must remark that
      I prize your friendship, but it is not for me to marry now. You have
      convinced me of your goodness of heart and freedom from unworthy
      suspicions; let that be enough. The best way in which I in my turn can
      convince you of my goodness of heart is by asking you to see me in private
      no more.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And do you refuse to think of me as &mdash;-. Why do you treat me like
      that, after all?' said Neigh, surprised at this want of harmony with his
      principle that one convert to matrimony could always find a second
      ready-made.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I cannot explain, I cannot explain,' said she, impatiently. 'I would and
      I would not-explain I mean, not marry. I don't love anybody, and I have no
      heart left for beginning. It is only honest in me to tell you that I am
      interested in watching another man's career, though that is not to the
      point either, for no close relationship with him is contemplated. But I do
      not wish to speak of this any more. Do not press me to it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Certainly I will not,' said Neigh, seeing that she was distressed and
      sorrowful. 'But do consider me and my wishes; I have a right to ask it for
      it is only asking a continuance of what you have already begun to do.
      To-morrow I believe I shall have the happiness of seeing you again.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not say no, and long after the door had closed upon him she
      remained fixed in thought. 'How can he be blamed for his manner,' she
      said, 'after knowing what I did!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta as she sat felt herself much less a Petherwin than a Chickerel,
      much less a poetess richly freighted with fancy than an adventuress with a
      nebulous prospect. Neigh was one of the few men whose presence seemed to
      attenuate her dignity in some mysterious way to its very least
      proportions; and that act of espial, which had so quickly and inexplicably
      come to his knowledge, helped his influence still more. She knew little of
      the nature of the town bachelor; there were opaque depths in him which her
      thoughts had never definitely plumbed. Notwithstanding her exaltation to
      the atmosphere of the Petherwin family, Ethelberta was very far from
      having the thoroughbred London woman's knowledge of sets, grades,
      coteries, cliques, forms, glosses, and niceties, particularly on the
      masculine side. Setting the years from her infancy to her first look into
      town against those HANDlinking that epoch with the present, the former
      period covered not only the greater time, but contained the mass of her
      most vivid impressions of life and its ways. But in recognizing her
      ignorance of the ratio between words to women and deeds to women in the
      ethical code of the bachelor of the club, she forgot that human nature in
      the gross differs little with situation, and that a gift which, if the
      germs were lacking, no amount of training in clubs and coteries could
      supply, was mother-wit like her own.

    <h2>
      27. MRS. BELMAINE'S-CRIPPLEGATE CHURCH
    </h2>
    <p>
      Neigh's remark that he believed he should see Ethelberta again the next
      day referred to a contemplated pilgrimage of an unusual sort which had
      been arranged for that day by Mrs. Belmaine upon the ground of an
      incidental suggestion of Ethelberta's. One afternoon in the week previous
      they had been chatting over tea at the house of the former lady, Neigh
      being present as a casual caller, when the conversation was directed upon
      Milton by somebody opening a volume of the poet's works that lay on a
      table near.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    'Milton! thou shouldst be living at this hour:
    England hath need of thee-'
</pre>
    <p>
      said Mrs. Belmaine with the degree of flippancy which is considered
      correct for immortal verse, the Bible, God, etc., in these days. And
      Ethelberta replied, lit up by a quick remembrance, 'It is a good time to
      talk of Milton; for I have been much impressed by reading the "Life;" and
      I have decided to go and see his tomb. Could we not all go? We ought to
      quicken our memories of the great, and of where they lie, by such a visit
      occasionally.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'We ought,' said Mrs. Belmaine.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And why shouldn't we?' continued Ethelberta, with interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      'To Westminster Abbey?' said Mr. Belmaine, a common man of thirty, younger
      than his wife, who had lately come into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No; to where he lies comparatively alone-Cripplegate Church.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I always thought that Milton was buried in Poet's Corner,' said Mr.
      Belmaine.
    </p>
    <p>
      'So did I,' said Neigh; 'but I have such an indifferent head for places
      that my thinking goes for nothing.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, it would be a pretty thing to do,' said Mrs. Belmaine, 'and
      instructive to all of us. If Mrs. Petherwin would like to go, I should. We
      can take you in the carriage and call round for Mrs. Doncastle on our way,
      and set you both down again coming back.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That would be excellent,' said Ethelberta. 'There is nowhere I like going
      to so much as the depths of the city. The absurd narrowness of
      world-renowned streets is so surprising-so crooked and shady as they are
      too, and full of the quaint smells of old cupboards and cellars. Walking
      through one of them reminds me of being at the bottom of some crevasse or
      gorge, the proper surface of the globe being the tops of the houses.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You will come to take care of us, John? And you, Mr. Neigh, would like to
      come? We will tell Mr. Ladywell that he may join us if he cares to,' said
      Mrs. Belmaine.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O yes,' said her husband quietly; and Neigh said he should like nothing
      better, after a faint aspect of apprehension at the remoteness of the idea
      from the daily track of his thoughts. Mr. Belmaine observing this, and
      mistaking it for an indication that Neigh had been dragged into the party
      against his will by his over-hasty wife, arranged that Neigh should go
      independently and meet them there at the hour named if he chose to do so,
      to give him an opportunity of staying away. Ethelberta also was by this
      time doubting if she had not been too eager with her proposal. To go on
      such a sentimental errand might be thought by her friends to be simply
      troublesome, their adherence having been given only in the regular course
      of complaisance. She was still comparatively an outsider here, her life
      with Lady Petherwin having been passed chiefly in alternations between
      English watering-places and continental towns. However, it was too late
      now to muse on this, and it may be added that from first to last
      Ethelberta never discovered from the Belmaines whether her proposal had
      been an infliction or a charm, so perfectly were they practised in
      sustaining that complete divorce between thinking and saying which is the
      hall-mark of high civilization.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, however she might doubt the Belmaines, she had no doubt as to Neigh's
      true sentiments: the time had come when he, notwithstanding his air of
      being oppressed by almost every lively invention of town and country for
      charming griefs to rest, would not be at all oppressed by a quiet visit to
      the purlieus of St Giles's, Cripplegate, since she was the originator, and
      was going herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a bright hope-inspiring afternoon in this mid-May time when the
      carriage containing Mr. and Mrs. Belmaine, Mrs. Doncastle, and Ethelberta,
      crept along the encumbered streets towards Barbican; till turning out of
      that thoroughfare into Redcross Street they beheld the bold shape of the
      old tower they sought, clothed in every neutral shade, standing clear
      against the sky, dusky and grim in its upper stage, and hoary grey below,
      where every corner of every stone was completely rounded off by the waves
      of wind and storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      All people were busy here: our visitors seemed to be the only idle persons
      the city contained; and there was no dissonance-there never is-between
      antiquity and such beehive industry; for pure industry, in failing to
      observe its own existence and aspect, partakes of the unobtrusive nature
      of material things. This intra-mural stir was a flywheel transparent by
      excessive motion, through which Milton and his day could be seen as if
      nothing intervened. Had there been ostensibly harmonious accessories, a
      crowd of observing people in search of the poetical, conscious of the
      place and the scene, what a discord would have arisen there! But everybody
      passed by Milton's grave except Ethelberta and her friends, and for the
      moment the city's less invidious conduct appeared to her more respectful
      as a practice than her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she was brought out of this rumination by the halt at the church door,
      and completely reminded of the present by finding the church open, and
      Neigh-the, till yesterday, unimpassioned Neigh-waiting in the vestibule to
      receive them, just as if he lived there. Ladywell had not arrived. It was
      a long time before Ethelberta could get back to Milton again, for Neigh
      was continuing to impend over her future more and more visibly. The
      objects along the journey had distracted her mind from him; but the moment
      now was as a direct renewal and prolongation of the declaration-time
      yesterday, and as if in furtherance of the conclusion of the episode.
    </p>
    <p>
      They all alighted and went in, the coachman being told to take the
      carriage to a quiet nook further on, and return in half-an-hour. Mrs.
      Belmaine and her carriage some years before had accidentally got jammed
      crosswise in Cheapside through the clumsiness of the man in turning up a
      side street, blocking that great artery of the civilized world for the
      space of a minute and a half, when they were pounced upon by half-a-dozen
      policemen and forced to back ignominiously up a little slit between the
      houses where they did not mean to go, amid the shouts of the hindered
      drivers; and it was her nervous recollection of that event which caused
      Mrs. Belmaine to be so precise in her directions now.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time that they were grouped around the tomb the visit had assumed a
      much more solemn complexion than any one among them had anticipated.
      Ashamed of the influence that she discovered Neigh to be exercising over
      her, and opposing it steadily, Ethelberta drew from her pocket a small
      edition of Milton, and proposed that she should read a few lines from
      'Paradise Lost.' The responsibility of producing a successful afternoon
      was upon her shoulders; she was, moreover, the only one present who could
      properly manage blank verse, and this was sufficient to justify the
      proposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood with her head against the marble slab just below the bust, and
      began a selected piece, Neigh standing a few yards off on her right
      looking into his hat in order to listen accurately, Mr. and Mrs. Belmaine
      and Mrs. Doncastle seating themselves in a pew directly facing the
      monument. The ripe warm colours of afternoon came in upon them from the
      west, upon the sallow piers and arches, and the infinitely deep brown pews
      beneath, the aisle over Ethelberta's head being in misty shade through
      which glowed a lurid light from a dark-stained window behind. The
      sentences fell from her lips in a rhythmical cadence one by one, and she
      could be fancied a priestess of him before whose image she stood, when
      with a vivid suggestiveness she delivered here, not many yards from the
      central money-mill of the world, yet out from the very tomb of their
      author, the passage containing the words:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          'Mammon led them on;
    Mammon, the least erected spirit that fell
    From heaven.'
</pre>
    <p>
      When she finished reading Ethelberta left the monument, and then each one
      present strayed independently about the building, Ethelberta turning to
      the left along the passage to the south door. Neigh-from whose usually
      apathetic face and eyes there had proceeded a secret smouldering light as
      he listened and regarded her-followed in the same direction and vanished
      at her heels into the churchyard, whither she had now gone. Mr. and Mrs.
      Belmaine exchanged glances, and instead of following the pair they went
      with Mrs. Doncastle into the vestry to inquire of the person in charge for
      the register of the marriage of Oliver Cromwell, which was solemnized
      here. The church was now quite empty, and its stillness was as a vacuum
      into which an occasional noise from the street overflowed and became
      rarefied away to nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something like five minutes had passed when a hansom stopped outside the
      door, and Ladywell entered the porch. He stood still, and, looking
      inquiringly round for a minute or two, sat down in one of the high pews,
      as if under the impression that the others had not yet arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he sat here Neigh reappeared at the south door opposite, and came
      slowly in. Ladywell, in rising to go to him, saw that Neigh's attention
      was engrossed by something he held in his hand. It was his pocket-book,
      and Neigh was looking at a few loose flower-petals which had been placed
      between the pages. When Ladywell came forward Neigh looked up, started,
      and closed the book quickly, so that some of the petals fluttered to the
      ground between the two men. They were striped, red and white, and appeared
      to be leaves of the Harlequin rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah! here you are, Ladywell,' he said, recovering himself. 'We had given
      you up: my aunt said that you would not care to come. They are all in the
      vestry.' How it came to pass that Neigh designated those in the vestry as
      'all,' when there was one in the churchyard, was a thing that he himself
      could hardly have explained, so much more had it to do with instinct than
      with calculation.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never mind them-don't interrupt them,' said Ladywell. 'The plain truth is
      that I have been very greatly disturbed in mind; and I could not appear
      earlier by reason of it. I had some doubt about coming at all.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am sorry to hear that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Neigh-I may as well tell you and have done with it. I have found that a
      lady of my acquaintance has two strings to her bow, or I am very much in
      error.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What-Mrs. Petherwin?' said Neigh uneasily. 'But I thought that-that fancy
      was over with you long ago. Even your acquaintance with her was at an end,
      I thought.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'In a measure it is at an end. But let me tell you that what you call a
      fancy has been anything but a fancy with me, to be over like a spring
      shower. To speak plainly, Neigh, I consider myself badly used by that
      woman; damn badly used.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Badly used?' said Neigh mechanically, and wondering all the time if
      Ladywell had been informed that Ethelberta was to be one of the party
      to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I ought not to talk like that,' said Ladywell, adopting a lighter
      tone. 'All is fair in courtship, I suppose, now as ever. Indeed, I mean to
      put a good face upon it: if I am beaten, I am. But it is very provoking,
      after supposing matters to be going on smoothly, to find out that you are
      quite mistaken.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I told you you were quite mistaken in supposing she cared for you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That is just the point I was not mistaken in,' said Ladywell warmly. 'She
      did care for me, and I stood as well with her as any man could stand until
      this fellow came, whoever he is. I sometimes feel so disturbed about it
      that I have a good mind to call upon her and ask his name. Wouldn't you,
      Neigh? Will you accompany me?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I would in a moment, but, but- I strongly advise you not to go,' said
      Neigh earnestly. 'It would be rash, you know, and rather unmannerly; and
      would only hurt your feelings.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I am always ready to yield to a friend's arguments. . . . A
      sneaking scamp, that's what he is. Why does he not show himself?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't you really know who he is?' said Neigh, in a pronounced and
      exceptional tone, on purpose to give Ladywell a chance of suspecting, for
      the position was getting awkward. But Ladywell was blind as Bartimeus in
      that direction, so well had indifference to Ethelberta's charms been
      feigned by Neigh until he thought seriously of marrying her. Yet,
      unfortunately for the interests of calmness, Ladywell was less blind with
      his outward eye. In his reflections his glance had lingered again upon the
      pocket-book which Neigh still held in his hand, and upon the two or three
      rose-leaves on the floor, until he said idly, superimposing humorousness
      upon misery, as men in love can:
    </p>
    <p>
      'Rose-leaves, Neigh? I thought you did not care for flowers. What makes
      you amuse yourself with such sentimental objects as those, only fit for
      women, or painters like me? If I had not observed you with my own eyes I
      should have said that you were about the last man in the world to care for
      things of that sort. Whatever makes you keep rose-leaves in your
      pocket-book?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The best reason on earth,' said Neigh. 'A woman gave them to me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That proves nothing unless she is a great deal to you,' said Ladywell,
      with the experienced air of a man who, whatever his inferiority in years
      to Neigh, was far beyond him in knowledge of that sort, by virtue of his
      recent trials.
    </p>
    <p>
      'She is a great deal to me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If I did not know you to be such a confirmed misogynist I should say that
      this is a serious matter.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is serious,' said Neigh quietly. 'The probability is that I shall
      marry the woman who gave me these. Anyhow I have asked her the question,
      and she has not altogether said no.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am glad to hear it, Neigh,' said Ladywell heartily. 'I am glad to hear
      that your star is higher than mine.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Neigh could make further reply Ladywell was attracted by the glow
      of green sunlight reflected through the south door by the grass of the
      churchyard, now in all its spring freshness and luxuriance. He bent his
      steps thither, followed anxiously by Neigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I had no idea there was such a lovely green spot in the city,' Ladywell
      continued, passing out. 'Trees too, planted in the manner of an orchard.
      What a charming place!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The place was truly charming just at that date. The untainted leaves of
      the lime and plane trees and the newly-sprung grass had in the sun a
      brilliancy of beauty that was brought into extraordinary prominence by the
      sable soil showing here and there, and the charcoaled stems and trunks out
      of which the leaves budded: they seemed an importation, not a produce, and
      their delicacy such as would perish in a day.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What is this round tower?' Ladywell said again, walking towards the
      iron-grey bastion, partly covered with ivy and Virginia creeper, which
      stood obtruding into the enclosure.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, didn't you know that was here? That's a piece of the old city wall,'
      said Neigh, looking furtively around at the same time. Behind the bastion
      the churchyard ran into a long narrow strip, grassed like the other part,
      but completely hidden from it by the cylinder of ragged masonry. On
      rounding this projection, Ladywell beheld within a few feet of him a lady
      whom he knew too well.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mrs. Petherwin here!' exclaimed he, proving how ignorant he had been of
      the composition of the party he was to meet, and accounting at the same
      time for his laxity in attending it.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I forgot to tell you,' said Neigh awkwardly, behind him, 'that Mrs.
      Petherwin was to come with us.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta's look was somewhat blushful and agitated, as if from some late
      transaction: she appeared to have been secluding herself there till she
      should have recovered her equanimity. However, she came up to him and
      said, 'I did not see you before this moment: we had been thinking you
      would not come.'
    </p>
    <p>
      While these words were being prettily spoken, Ladywell's face became pale
      as death. On Ethelberta's bosom were the stem and green calyx of a rose,
      almost all its flower having disappeared. It had been a Harlequin rose,
      for two or three of its striped leaves remained to tell the tale.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not help noticing his fixed gaze, and she said quickly, 'Yes, I
      have lost my pretty rose: this may as well go now,' and she plucked the
      stem from its fastening in her dress and flung it away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Ladywell turned round to meet Mr. and Mrs. Belmaine, whose voices
      were beginning to be heard just within the church door, leaving Neigh and
      Ethelberta together. It was a graceful act of young Ladywell's that, in
      the midst of his own pain at the strange tale the rose-leaves
      suggested-Neigh's rivalry, Ethelberta's mutability, his own defeat-he was
      not regardless of the intense embarrassment which might have been caused
      had he remained.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two were silent at first, and it was evident that Ethelberta's mood
      was one of anger at something that had gone before. She turned aside from
      him to follow the others, when Neigh spoke in a tone somewhat bitter and
      somewhat stern.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What-going like that! After being compromised together, why don't you
      close with me? Ladywell knows all: I had already told him that the
      rose-leaves were given me by my intended wife. We seem to him to be
      practising deceptions all of a piece, and what folly it is to play off so!
      As to what I did, that I ask your forgiveness for.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta looked upon the ground and maintained a compressed lip. Neigh
      resumed: 'If I showed more feeling than you care for, I insist that it was
      not more than was natural under the circumstances, if not quite proper.
      Opinions may differ, but my experience goes to prove that conventional
      squeamishness at such times as these is more talked and written about than
      practised. Plain behaviour must be expected when marriage is the question.
      Nevertheless, I do say-and I cannot say more-that I am sincerely sorry to
      have offended you by exceeding my privileges. I will never do so again.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't say privileges. You have none.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am sorry that I thought otherwise, and that others will think so too.
      Ladywell is, at any rate, bent on thinking so. . . . It might have been
      made known to him in a gentle way-but God disposes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'There is nothing to make known-I don't understand,' said Ethelberta,
      going from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time Ladywell had walked round the gravel walks with the two other
      ladies and Mr. Belmaine, and they were all turning to come back again. The
      young painter had deputed his voice to reply to their remarks, but his
      understanding continued poring upon other things. When he came up to
      Ethelberta, his agitation had left him: she too was free from constraint;
      while Neigh was some distance off, carefully examining nothing in
      particular in an old fragment of wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little party was now united again as to its persons; though in spirit
      far otherwise. They went through the church in general talk, Ladywell sad
      but serene, and Ethelberta keeping far-removed both from him and from
      Neigh. She had at this juncture entered upon that Sphinx-like stage of
      existence in which, contrary to her earlier manner, she signified to no
      one of her ways, plans, or sensations, and spoke little on any subject at
      all. There were occasional smiles now which came only from the face, and
      speeches from the lips merely.
    </p>
    <p>
      The journey home was performed as they had come, Ladywell not accepting
      the seat in Neigh's cab which was phlegmatically offered him. Mrs.
      Doncastle's acquaintance with Ethelberta had been slight until this day;
      but the afternoon's proceeding had much impressed the matron with her
      younger friend. Before they parted she said, with the sort of affability
      which is meant to signify the beginning of permanent friendship: 'A friend
      of my husband's, Lord Mountclere, has been anxious for some time to meet
      you. He is a great admirer of the poems, and more still of the
      story-telling invention, and your power in it. He has been present many
      times at the Mayfair Hall to hear you. When will you dine with us to meet
      him? I know you will like him. Will Thursday be convenient?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta stood for a moment reflecting, and reflecting hoped that Mrs.
      Doncastle had not noticed her momentary perplexity. Crises were becoming
      as common with her as blackberries; and she had foreseen this one a long
      time. It was not that she was to meet Lord Mountclere, for he was only a
      name and a distant profile to her: it was that her father would
      necessarily be present at the meeting, in the most anomalous position that
      human nature could endure.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, having often proved in her disjointed experience that the
      shortest way out of a difficulty lies straight through it, Ethelberta
      decided to dine at the Doncastles', and, as she murmured that she should
      have great pleasure in meeting any friend of theirs, set about contriving
      how the encounter with her dearest relative might be made safe and
      unsuspected. She bade them adieu blithely; but the thoughts engendered by
      the invitation stood before her as sorrowful and rayless ghosts which
      could not be laid. Often at such conjunctures as these, when the futility
      of her great undertaking was more than usually manifest, did Ethelberta
      long like a tired child for the conclusion of the whole matter; when her
      work should be over, and the evening come; when she might draw her boat
      upon the shore, and in some thymy nook await eternal night with a placid
      mind.

    <h2>
      28. ETHELBERTA'S-MR. CHICKEREL'S ROOM
    </h2>
    <p>
      The question of Neigh or no Neigh had reached a pitch of insistence which
      no longer permitted of dallying, even by a popular beauty. His character
      was becoming defined to Ethelberta as something very differently composed
      from that of her first imagining. She had set him down to be a man whose
      external in excitability owed nothing to self-repression, but stood as the
      natural surface of the mass within. Neigh's urban torpor, she said, might
      have been in the first instance produced by art, but, were it thus, it had
      gone so far as to permeate him. This had been disproved, first
      surprisingly, by his reported statement; wondrously, in the second place,
      by his call upon her and sudden proposal; thirdly, to a degree simply
      astounding, by what had occurred in the city that day. For Neigh, before
      the fervour had subsided which was produced in him by her look and general
      power while reading 'Paradise Lost,' found himself alone with her in a
      nook outside the church, and there had almost demanded her promise to be
      his wife. She had replied by asking for time, and idly offering him the
      petals of her rose, that had shed themselves in her hand. Neigh, in taking
      them, pressed her fingers more warmly than she thought she had given him
      warrant for, which offended her. It was certainly a very momentary affair,
      and when it was over seemed to surprise himself almost as much as it had
      vexed her; but it had reminded her of one truth which she was in danger of
      forgetting. The town gentleman was not half so far removed from Sol and
      Dan, and the hard-handed order in general, in his passions as in his
      philosophy. He still continued to be the male of his species, and when the
      heart was hot with a dream Pall Mall had much the same aspect as Wessex.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, she had not accepted him yet; indeed, for the moment they were in a
      pet with one another. Yet that might soon be cleared off, and then
      recurred the perpetual question, would the advantage that might accrue to
      her people by her marriage be worth the sacrifice? One palliative feature
      must be remembered when we survey the matrimonial ponderings of the
      poetess and romancer. What she contemplated was not meanly to ensnare a
      husband just to provide incomes for her and her family, but to find some
      man she might respect, who would maintain her in such a stage of comfort
      as should, by setting her mind free from temporal anxiety, enable her to
      further organize her talent, and provide incomes for them herself. Plenty
      of saleable originality was left in her as yet, but it was getting crushed
      under the rubbish of her necessities.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was not sure that Neigh would stand the test of her revelations. It
      would be possible to lead him to marry her without revealing anything-the
      events of the last few days had shown her that-yet Ethelberta's honesty
      shrank from the safe course of holding her tongue. It might be pleasant to
      many a modern gentleman to find himself allied with a lady, none of whose
      ancestors had ever pandered to a court, lost an army, taken a bribe,
      oppressed a community, or broken a bank; but the added disclosure that, in
      avoiding these stains, her kindred had worked and continued to work with
      their hands for bread, might lead such an one to consider that the novelty
      was dearly purchased.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta was, upon the whole, dissatisfied with her progress thus far.
      She had planned many things and fulfilled few. Had her father been by this
      time provided for and made independent of the world, as she had thought he
      might be, not only would her course with regard to Neigh be quite clear,
      but the impending awkwardness of dining with her father behind her chair
      could not have occurred. True, that was a small matter beside her regret
      for his own sake that he was still in harness; and a mere change of
      occupation would be but a tribute to a fastidiousness which he did not
      himself share. She had frequently tried to think of a vocation for him
      that would have a more dignified sound, and be less dangerously close to
      her own path: the post of care-taker at some provincial library, country
      stationer, registrar of births and deaths, and many others had been
      discussed and dismissed in face of the unmanageable fact that her father
      was serenely happy and comfortable as a butler, looking with dread at any
      hint of change short of perfect retirement. Since, then, she could not
      offer him this retirement, what right had she to interfere with his mode
      of life at all? In no other social groove on earth would he thrive as he
      throve in his present one, to which he had been accustomed from boyhood,
      and where the remuneration was actually greater than in professions ten
      times as stately in name.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the rest, too, Ethelberta had indulged in hopes, the high education of
      the younger ones being the chief of these darling wishes. Picotee wanted
      looking to badly enough. Sol and Dan required no material help; they had
      quickly obtained good places of work under a Pimlico builder; for though
      the brothers scarcely showed as yet the light-fingered deftness of London
      artizans, the want was in a measure compensated by their painstaking, and
      employers are far from despising country hands who bring with them
      strength, industry, and a desire to please. But their sister had other
      lines laid down for them than those of level progress; to start them some
      day as masters instead of men was a long-cherished wish of Ethelberta's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus she had quite enough machinery in her hands to keep decently going,
      even were she to marry a man who would take a kindly view of her peculiar
      situation, and afford her opportunities of strengthening her powers for
      her kindred's good. But what would be the result if, eighteen months
      hence-the date at which her occupation of the house in Exonbury Crescent
      came to an end-she were still a widow, with no accumulated capital, her
      platform talents grown homely and stunted through narrow living, and her
      tender vein of poesy completely dispersed by it? To calmly relinquish the
      struggle at that point would have been the act of a stoic, but not of a
      woman, particularly when she considered the children, the hopes of her
      mother for them, and her own condition-though this was least-under the
      ironical cheers which would greet a slip back into the mire.
    </p>
    <p>
      It here becomes necessary to turn for a moment to Master Joey Chickerel,
      Ethelberta's troublesome page and brother. The face of this juvenile was
      that of a Graeco-Roman satyr to the furthest degree of completeness.
      Viewed in front, the outer line of his upper lip rose in a double arch
      nearly to his little round nostrils, giving an expression of a jollity so
      delicious to himself as to compel a perpetual drawing in of his breath.
      During half-laughs his lips parted in the middle, and remained closed at
      the corners, which were small round pits like his nostrils, the same form
      being repeated as dimples a little further back upon his cheek. The
      opening for each eye formed a sparkling crescent, both upper and under lid
      having the convexity upwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      But during some few days preceding the dinner-party at the Doncastles' all
      this changed. The luxuriant curves departed, a compressed lineality was to
      be observed everywhere, the pupils of his eyes seemed flattened, and the
      carriage of his head was limp and sideways. This was a feature so
      remarkable and new in him that Picotee noticed it, and was lifted from the
      melancholy current of her own affairs in contemplating his.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, what's the matter?' said Picotee.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O-nothing,' said Joey.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nothing? How can you say so?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The world's a holler mockery-that's what I say.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, so it is, to some; but not to you,' said Picotee, sighing.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't talk argument, Picotee. I only hope you'll never feel what I feel
      now. If it wasn't for my juties here I know what I'd do; I'd 'list, that's
      what I'd do. But having my position to fill here as the only responsible
      man-servant in the house, I can't leave.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Has anybody been beating you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Beating! Do I look like a person who gets beatings? No, it is a madness,'
      said Joey, putting his hand upon his chest. 'The case is, I am in love.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O Joey, a boy no bigger than you are!' said Picotee reprovingly. Her
      personal interest in the passion, however, provoked her to inquire, in the
      next breath, 'Who is it? Do tell, Joey.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No bigger than I! What hev bigness to do with it? That's just like your
      old-fashioned notions. Bigness is no more wanted in courting nowadays than
      in soldiering or smoking or any other duty of man. Husbands is rare; and a
      promising courter who means business will fetch his price in these times,
      big or small, I assure ye. I might have been engaged a dozen times over as
      far as the bigness goes. You should see what a miserable little fellow my
      rival is afore you talk like that. Now you know I've got a rival, perhaps
      you'll own there must be something in it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, that seems like the real thing. But who is the young woman?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I don't mind telling you, Picotee. It is Mrs. Doncastle's new maid.
      I called to see father last night, and had supper there; and you should
      have seen how lovely she were-eating sparrowgrass sideways, as if she were
      born to it. But, of course, there's a rival-there always is-I might have
      known that, and I will crush him!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But Mrs. Doncastle's new maid-if that was she I caught a glimpse of the
      other day-is ever so much older than you-a dozen years.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What's that to a man in love? Pooh-I wish you would leave me, Picotee; I
      wants to be alone.'
    </p>
    <p>
      A short time after this Picotee was in the company of Ethelberta, and she
      took occasion to mention Joey's attachment. Ethelberta grew exceedingly
      angry directly she heard of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What a fearful nuisance that boy is becoming,' she said. 'Does father
      know anything of this?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I think not,' said Picotee. 'O no, he cannot; he would not allow any such
      thing to go on; she is so much older than Joey.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I should think he wouldn't allow it! The fact is I must be more strict
      about this growing friendliness between you all and the Doncastle
      servants. There shall be absolutely no intimacy or visiting of any sort.
      When father wants to see any of you he must come here, unless there is a
      most serious reason for your calling upon him. Some disclosure or
      reference to me otherwise than as your mistress, will certainly be made
      else, and then I am ruined. I will speak to father myself about Joey's
      absurd nonsense this evening. I am going to see him on another matter.'
      And Ethelberta sighed. 'I am to dine there on Thursday,' she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      'To dine there, Berta? Well, that is a strange thing! Why, father will be
      close to you!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' said Ethelberta quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How I should like to see you sitting at a grand dinner-table, among
      lordly dishes and shining people, and father about the room unnoticed!
      Berta, I have never seen a dinner-party in my life, and father said that I
      should some day; he promised me long ago.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How will he be able to carry out that, my dear child?' said Ethelberta,
      drawing her sister gently to her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Father says that for an hour and a half the guests are quite fixed in the
      dining-room, and as unlikely to move as if they were trees planted round
      the table. Do let me go and see you, Berta,' Picotee added coaxingly. 'I
      would give anything to see how you look in the midst of elegant people
      talking and laughing, and you my own sister all the time, and me looking
      on like puss-in-the-corner.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta could hardly resist the entreaty, in spite of her recent
      resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      'We will leave that to be considered when I come home to-night,' she said.
      'I must hear what father says.'
    </p>
    <p>
      After dark the same evening a woman, dressed in plain black and wearing a
      hood, went to the servants' entrance of Mr. Doncastle's house, and
      inquired for Mr. Chickerel. Ethelberta found him in a room by himself, and
      on entering she closed the door behind her, and unwrapped her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Can you sit with me a few minutes, father?' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, for a quarter of an hour or so,' said the butler. 'Has anything
      happened? I thought it might be Picotee.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No. All's well yet. But I thought it best to see you upon one or two
      matters which are harassing me a little just now. The first is, that
      stupid boy Joey has got entangled in some way with the lady's-maid at this
      house; a ridiculous affair it must be by all account, but it is too
      serious for me to treat lightly. She will worm everything out of him, and
      a pretty business it will be then.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'God bless my soul! why, the woman is old enough to be his mother! I have
      never heard a sound of it till now. What do you propose to do?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have hardly thought: I cannot tell at all. But we will consider that
      after I have done. The next thing is, I am to dine here Thursday-that is,
      to-morrow.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You going to dine here, are you?' said her father in surprise. 'Dear me,
      that's news. We have a dinner-party to-morrow, but I was not aware that
      you knew our people.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have accepted the invitation,' said Ethelberta. 'But if you think I had
      better stay away, I will get out of it by some means. Heavens! what does
      that mean-will anybody come in?' she added, rapidly pulling up her hood
      and jumping from the seat as the loud tones of a bell clanged forth in
      startling proximity.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no-it is all safe,' said her father. 'It is the area door-nothing to do
      with me. About the dinner: I don't see why you may not come. Of course you
      will take no notice of me, nor shall I of you. It is to be rather a large
      party. Lord What's-his-name is coming, and several good people.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes; he is coming to meet me, it appears. But, father,' she said more
      softly and slowly, 'how wrong it will be for me to come so close to you,
      and never recognize you! I don't like it. I wish you could have given up
      service by this time; it would have been so much less painful for us all
      round. I thought we might have been able to manage it somehow.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nonsense, nonsense,' said Mr. Chickerel crossly. 'There is not the least
      reason why I should give up. I want to save a little money first. If you
      don't like me as I am, you must keep away from me. Don't be uneasy about
      my comfort; I am right enough, thank God. I can mind myself for many a
      year yet.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta looked at him with tears in her eyes, but she did not speak.
      She never could help crying when she met her father here.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have been in service now for more than seven-and-thirty years,' her
      father went on. 'It is an honourable calling; and why should you maintain
      me because you can earn a few pounds by your gifts, and an old woman left
      you her house and a few sticks of furniture? If she had left you any money
      it would have been a different thing, but as you have to work for every
      penny you get, I cannot think of it. Suppose I should agree to come and
      live with you, and then you should be ill, or such like, and I no longer
      able to help myself? O no, I'll stick where I am, for here I am safe as to
      food and shelter at any rate. Surely, Ethelberta, it is only right that I,
      who ought to keep you all, should at least keep your mother and myself? As
      to our position, that we cannot help; and I don't mind that you are unable
      to own me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I wish I could own you-all of you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, you chose your course, my dear; and you must abide by it. Having
      put your hand to the plough, it will be foolish to turn back.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It would, I suppose. Yet I wish I could get a living by some simple
      humble occupation, and drop the name of Petherwin, and be Berta Chickerel
      again, and live in a green cottage as we used to do when I was small. I am
      miserable to a pitiable degree sometimes, and sink into regrets that I
      ever fell into such a groove as this. I don't like covert deeds, such as
      coming here to-night, and many are necessary with me from time to time.
      There is something without which splendid energies are a drug; and that is
      a cold heart. There is another thing necessary to energy, too-the power of
      distinguishing your visions from your reasonable forecasts when looking
      into the future, so as to allow your energy to lay hold of the forecasts
      only. I begin to have a fear that mother is right when she implies that I
      undertook to carry out visions and all. But ten of us are so many to cope
      with. If God Almighty had only killed off three-quarters of us when we
      were little, a body might have done something for the rest; but as we are
      it is hopeless!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'There is no use in your going into high doctrine like that,' said
      Chickerel. 'As I said before, you chose your course. You have begun to fly
      high, and you had better keep there.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And to do that there is only one way-that is, to do it surely, so that I
      have some groundwork to enable me to keep up to the mark in my profession.
      That way is marriage.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Marriage? Who are you going to marry?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'God knows. Perhaps Lord Mountclere. Stranger things have happened.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, so they have; though not many wretcheder things. I would sooner see
      you in your grave, Ethelberta, than Lord Mountclere's wife, or the wife of
      anybody like him, great as the honour would be.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of course that was only something to say; I don't know the man even.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I know his valet. However, marry who you may, I hope you'll be happy, my
      dear girl. You would be still more divided from us in that event; but when
      your mother and I are dead, it will make little difference.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta placed her hand upon his shoulder, and smiled cheerfully. 'Now,
      father, don't despond. All will be well, and we shall see no such
      misfortune as that for many a year. Leave all to me. I am a rare hand at
      contrivances.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are indeed, Berta. It seems to me quite wonderful that we should be
      living so near together and nobody suspect the relationship, because of
      the precautions you have taken.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yet the precautions were rather Lady Petherwin's than mine, as you know.
      Consider how she kept me abroad. My marriage being so secret made it easy
      to cut off all traces, unless anybody had made it a special business to
      search for them. That people should suspect as yet would be by far the
      more wonderful thing of the two. But we must, for one thing, have no
      visiting between our girls and the servants here, or they soon will
      suspect.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta then laid down a few laws on the subject, and, explaining the
      other details of her visit, told her father soon that she must leave him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took her along the passage and into the area. They were standing at the
      bottom of the steps, saying a few parting words about Picotee's visit to
      see the dinner, when a female figure appeared by the railing above,
      slipped in at the gate, and flew down the steps past the father and
      daughter. At the moment of passing she whispered breathlessly to him, 'Is
      that you, Mr. Chickerel?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' said the butler.
    </p>
    <p>
      She tossed into his arms a quantity of wearing apparel, and adding,
      'Please take them upstairs for me-I am late,' rushed into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good heavens, what does that mean?' said Ethelberta, holding her father's
      arm in her uneasiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's the new lady's-maid, just come in from an evening walk-that young
      scamp's sweetheart, if what you tell me is true. I don't yet know what her
      character is, but she runs neck and neck with time closer than any woman I
      ever met. She stays out at night like this till the last moment, and often
      throws off her dashing courting-clothes in this way, as she runs down the
      steps, to save a journey to the top of the house to her room before going
      to Mrs. Doncastle's, who is in fact at this minute waiting for her. Only
      look here.' Chickerel gathered up a hat decked with feathers and flowers,
      a parasol, and a light muslin train-skirt, out of the pocket of the latter
      tumbling some long golden tresses of hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What an extraordinary woman,' said Ethelberta. 'A perfect Cinderella. The
      idea of Joey getting desperate about a woman like that; no doubt she has
      just come in from meeting him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No doubt-a blockhead. That's his taste, is it! I'll soon see if I can't
      cure his taste if it inclines towards Mrs. Menlove.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mrs. what?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Menlove; that's her name. She came about a fortnight ago.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And is that Menlove-what shall we do!' exclaimed Ethelberta. 'The idea of
      the boy singling out her-why it is ruin to him, to me, and to us all!'
    </p>
    <p>
      She hastily explained to her father that Menlove had been Lady Petherwin's
      maid and her own at some time before the death of her mother-in-law, that
      she had only stayed with them through a three months' tour because of her
      flightiness, and hence had learnt nothing of Ethelberta's history, and
      probably had never thought at all about it. But nevertheless they were as
      well acquainted as a lady and her maid well could be in the time. 'Like
      all such doubtful characters,' continued Ethelberta, 'she was one of the
      cleverest and lightest-handed women we ever had about us. When she first
      came, my hair was getting quite weak; but by brushing it every day in a
      peculiar manner, and treating it as only she knew how, she brought it into
      splendid condition.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, this is the devil to pay, upon my life!' said Mr. Chickerel, with a
      miserable gaze at the bundle of clothes and the general situation at the
      same time. 'Unfortunately for her friendship, I have snubbed her two or
      three times already, for I don't care about her manner. You know she has a
      way of trading on a man's sense of honour till it puts him into an awkward
      position. She is perfectly well aware that, whatever scrape I find her out
      in, I shall not have the conscience to report her, because I am a man, and
      she is a defenceless woman; and so she takes advantage of one's feeling by
      making me, or either of the menservants, her bottle-holder, as you see she
      has done now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'This is all simply dreadful,' said Ethelberta. 'Joey is shrewd and
      trustworthy; but in the hands of such a woman as that! I suppose she did
      not recognize me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'There was no chance of that in the dark.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I cannot do anything in it,' said she. 'I cannot manage Joey at
      all.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will see if I can,' said Mr. Chickerel. 'Courting at his age,
      indeed-what shall we hear next!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Chickerel then accompanied his daughter along the street till an empty cab
      passed them, and putting her into it he returned to the house again.

      29. ETHELBERTA'S DRESSING-ROOM-MR. DONCASTLE'S HOUSE
    </h2>
    <p>
      The dressing of Ethelberta for the dinner-party was an undertaking into
      which Picotee threw her whole skill as tirewoman. Her energies were
      brisker that day than they had been at any time since the Julians first
      made preparations for departure from town; for a letter had come to her
      from Faith, telling of their arrival at the old cathedral city, which was
      found to suit their inclinations and habits infinitely better than London;
      and that she would like Picotee to visit them there some day. Picotee
      felt, and so probably felt the writer of the letter, that such a visit
      would not be very practicable just now; but it was a pleasant idea, and
      for fastening dreams upon was better than nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such musings were encouraged also by Ethelberta's remarks as the dressing
      went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      'We will have a change soon,' she said; 'we will go out of town for a few
      days. It will do good in many ways. I am getting so alarmed about the
      health of the children; their faces are becoming so white and thin and
      pinched that an old acquaintance would hardly know them; and they were so
      plump when they came. You are looking as pale as a ghost, and I daresay I
      am too. A week or two at Knollsea will see us right.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, how charming!' said Picotee gladly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Knollsea was a village on the coast, not very far from Melchester, the new
      home of Christopher; not very far, that is to say, in the eye of a
      sweetheart; but seeing that there was, as the crow flies, a stretch of
      thirty-five miles between the two places, and that more than one-third the
      distance was without a railway, an elderly gentleman might have considered
      their situations somewhat remote from each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why have you chosen Knollsea?' inquired Picotee.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Because of aunt's letter from Rouen-have you seen it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I did not read it through.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She wants us to get a copy of the register of her baptism; and she is not
      absolutely certain which of the parishes in and about Knollsea they were
      living in when she was born. Mother, being a year younger, cannot tell of
      course. First I thought of writing to the clergyman of each parish, but
      that would be troublesome, and might reveal the secret of my birth; but if
      we go down there for a few days, and take some lodgings, we shall be able
      to find out all about it at leisure. Gwendoline and Joey can attend to
      mother and the people downstairs, especially as father will look in every
      evening until he goes out of town, to see if they are getting on properly.
      It will be such a weight off my soul to slip away from acquaintances
      here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Will it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. At the same time I ought not to speak so, for they have been very
      kind. I wish we could go to Rouen afterwards; aunt repeats her invitation
      as usual. However, there is time enough to think of that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta was dressed at last, and, beholding the lonely look of poor
      Picotee when about to leave the room, she could not help having a
      sympathetic feeling that it was rather hard for her sister to be denied so
      small an enjoyment as a menial peep at a feast when she herself was to sit
      down to it as guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      'If you still want to go and see the procession downstairs you may do so,'
      she said reluctantly; 'provided that you take care of your tongue when you
      come in contact with Menlove, and adhere to father's instructions as to
      how long you may stay. It may be in the highest degree unwise; but never
      mind, go.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Ethelberta departed for the scene of action, just at the hour of the
      sun's lowest decline, when it was fading away, yellow and mild as
      candle-light, and when upper windows facing north-west reflected to
      persons in the street dissolving views of tawny cloud with brazen edges,
      the original picture of the same being hidden from sight by soiled walls
      and slaty slopes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before entering the presence of host and hostess, Ethelberta contrived to
      exchange a few words with her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      'In excellent time,' he whispered, full of paternal pride at the superb
      audacity of her situation here in relation to his. 'About half of them are
      come.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr. Neigh?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not yet; he's coming.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lord Mountclere?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. He came absurdly early; ten minutes before anybody else, so that
      Mrs. D. could hardly get on her bracelets and things soon enough to
      scramble downstairs and receive him; and he's as nervous as a boy. Keep up
      your spirits, dear, and don't mind me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will, father. And let Picotee see me at dinner if you can. She is very
      anxious to look at me. She will be here directly.'
    </p>
    <p>
      And Ethelberta, having been announced, joined the chamberful of assembled
      guests, among whom for the present we lose sight of her.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Meanwhile the evening outside the house was deepening in tone, and the
      lamps began to bHANDlink up. Her sister having departed, Picotee hastily
      arrayed herself in a little black jacket and chip hat, and tripped across
      the park to the same point. Chickerel had directed a maid-servant known as
      Jane to receive his humbler daughter and make her comfortable; and that
      friendly person, who spoke as if she had known Picotee five-and-twenty
      years, took her to the housekeeper's room, where the visitor deposited her
      jacket and hat, and rested awhile.
    </p>
    <p>
      A quick-eyed, light-haired, slight-built woman came in when Jane had gone.
      'Are you Miss Chickerel?' she said to Picotee.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' said Picotee, guessing that this was Menlove, and fearing her a
      little.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Jane tells me that you have come to visit your father, and would like to
      look at the company going to dinner. Well, they are not much to see, you
      know; but such as they are you are welcome to the sight of. Come along
      with me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I think I would rather wait for father, if you will excuse me, please.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Your father is busy now; it is no use for you to think of saying anything
      to him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Picotee followed her guide up a back staircase to the height of several
      flights, and then, crossing a landing, they descended to the upper part of
      the front stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now look over the balustrade, and you will see them all in a minute,'
      said Mrs. Menlove. 'O, you need not be timid; you can look out as far as
      you like. We are all independent here; no slavery for us: it is not as it
      is in the country, where servants are considered to be of different blood
      and bone from their employers, and to have no eyes for anything but their
      work. Here they are coming.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Picotee then had the pleasure of looking down upon a series of human
      crowns-some black, some white, some strangely built upon, some smooth and
      shining-descending the staircase in disordered column and great
      discomfort, their owners trying to talk, but breaking off in the midst of
      syllables to look to their footing. The young girl's eyes had not drooped
      over the handrail more than a few moments when she softly exclaimed,
      'There she is, there she is! How lovely she looks, does she not?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who?' said Mrs. Menlove.
    </p>
    <p>
      Picotee recollected herself, and hastily drew in her impulses. 'My dear
      mistress,' she said blandly. 'That is she on Mr. Doncastle's arm. And
      look, who is that funny old man the elderly lady is helping downstairs?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He is our honoured guest, Lord Mountclere. Mrs. Doncastle will have him
      all through the dinner, and after that he will devote himself to Mrs.
      Petherwin, your "dear mistress." He keeps looking towards her now, and no
      doubt thinks it a nuisance that she is not with him. Well, it is useless
      to stay here. Come a little further-we'll follow them.' Menlove began to
      lead the way downstairs, but Picotee held back.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Won't they see us?' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No. And if they do, it doesn't matter. Mrs. Doncastle would not object in
      the least to the daughter of her respected head man being accidentally
      seen in the hall.'
    </p>
    <p>
      They descended to the bottom and stood in the hall. 'O, there's father!'
      whispered Picotee, with childlike gladness, as Chickerel became visible to
      her by the door. The butler nodded to his daughter, and became again
      engrossed in his duties.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I wish I could see her-my mistress-again,' said Picotee.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You seem mightily concerned about your mistress,' said Menlove. 'Do you
      want to see if you have dressed her properly?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, partly; and I like her, too. She is very kind to me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You will have a chance of seeing her soon. When the door is nicely open
      you can look in for a moment. I must leave you now for a few minutes, but
      I will come again.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Menlove departed, and Picotee stood waiting. She wondered how Ethelberta
      was getting on, and whether she enjoyed herself as much as it seemed her
      duty to do in such a superbly hospitable place. Picotee then turned her
      attention to the hall, every article of furniture therein appearing worthy
      of scrutiny to her unaccustomed eyes. Here she walked and looked about for
      a long time till an excellent opportunity offered itself of seeing how
      affairs progressed in the dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the partly-opened door there became visible a sideboard which
      first attracted her attention by its richness. It was, indeed, a
      noticeable example of modern art-workmanship, in being exceptionally
      large, with curious ebony mouldings at different stages; and, while the
      heavy cupboard doors at the bottom were enriched with inlays of paler
      wood, other panels were decorated with tiles, as if the massive
      composition had been erected on the spot as part of the solid building.
      However, it was on a space higher up that Picotee's eyes and thoughts were
      fixed. In the great mirror above the middle ledge she could see reflected
      the upper part of the dining-room, and this suggested to her that she
      might see Ethelberta and the other guests reflected in the same way by
      standing on a chair, which, quick as thought, she did.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Picotee's dazed young vision her beautiful sister appeared as the chief
      figure of a glorious pleasure-parliament of both sexes, surrounded by
      whole regiments of candles grouped here and there about the room. She and
      her companions were seated before a large flowerbed, or small hanging
      garden, fixed at about the level of the elbow, the attention of all being
      concentrated rather upon the uninteresting margin of the bed, and upon
      each other, than on the beautiful natural objects growing in the middle,
      as it seemed to Picotee. In the ripple of conversation Ethelberta's clear
      voice could occasionally be heard, and her young sister could see that her
      eyes were bright, and her face beaming, as if divers social wants and
      looming penuriousness had never been within her experience. Mr. Doncastle
      was quite absorbed in what she was saying. So was the queer old man whom
      Menlove had called Lord Mountclere.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The dashing widow looks very well, does she not?' said a person at
      Picotee's elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was her conductor Menlove, now returned again, whom Picotee had quite
      forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      'She will do some damage here to-night you will find,' continued Menlove.
      'How long have you been with her?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, a long time-I mean rather a short time,' stammered Picotee.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I know her well enough. I was her maid once, or rather her
      mother-in-law's, but that was long before you knew her. I did not by any
      means find her so lovable as you seem to think her when I had to do with
      her at close quarters. An awful flirt-awful. Don't you find her so?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't know.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If you don't yet you will know. But come down from your perch-the
      dining-room door will not be open again for some time-and I will show you
      about the rooms upstairs. This is a larger house than Mrs. Petherwin's, as
      you see. Just come and look at the drawing-rooms.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Wishing much to get rid of Menlove, yet fearing to offend her, Picotee
      followed upstairs. Dinner was almost over by this time, and when they
      entered the front drawing-room a young man-servant and maid were there
      rekindling the lights.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now let's have a game of cat-and-mice,' said the maid-servant cheerily.
      'There's plenty of time before they come up.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Agreed,' said Menlove promptly. 'You will play, will you not, Miss
      Chickerel?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, indeed,' said Picotee, aghast.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never mind, then; you look on.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Away then ran the housemaid and Menlove, and the young footman started at
      their heels. Round the room, over the furniture, under the furniture,
      through the furniture, out of one window, along the balcony, in at another
      window, again round the room-so they glided with the swiftness of swallows
      and the noiselessness of ghosts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the housemaid drew a jew's-harp from her pocket, and struck up a
      lively waltz sotto voce. The footman seized Menlove, who appeared nothing
      loth, and began spinning gently round the room with her, to the time of
      the fascinating measure
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    'Which fashion hails, from countesses to queens,
    And maids and valets dance behind the scenes.'
</pre>
    <p>
      Picotee, who had been accustomed to unceiled country cottages all her
      life, wherein the scamper of a mouse is heard distinctly from floor to
      floor, exclaimed in a terrified whisper, at viewing all this, 'They'll
      hear you underneath, they'll hear you, and we shall all be ruined!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not at all,' came from the cautious dancers. 'These are some of the best
      built houses in London-double floors, filled in with material that will
      deaden any row you like to make, and we make none. But come and have a
      turn yourself, Miss Chickerel.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man relinquished Menlove, and on the spur of the moment seized
      Picotee. Picotee flounced away from him in indignation, backing into a
      corner with ruffled feathers, like a pullet trying to appear a hen.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How dare you touch me!' she said, with rounded eyes. 'I'll tell somebody
      downstairs of you, who'll soon see about it!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What a baby; she'll tell her father.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No I shan't; somebody you are all afraid of, that's who I'll tell.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nonsense,' said Menlove; 'he meant no harm.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Playtime was now getting short, and further antics being dangerous on that
      account, the performers retired again downstairs, Picotee of necessity
      following. Her nerves were screwed up to the highest pitch of uneasiness
      by the grotesque habits of these men and maids, who were quite unlike the
      country servants she had known, and resembled nothing so much as pixies,
      elves, or gnomes, peeping up upon human beings from their shady haunts
      underground, sometimes for good, sometimes for ill-sometimes doing heavy
      work, sometimes none; teasing and worrying with impish laughter half
      suppressed, and vanishing directly mortal eyes were bent on them. Separate
      and distinct from overt existence under the sun, this life could hardly be
      without its distinctive pleasures, all of them being more or less pervaded
      by thrills and titillations from games of hazard, and the perpetual risk
      of sensational surprises.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long before this time Picotee had begun to be anxious to get home again,
      but Menlove seemed particularly to desire her company, and pressed her to
      sit awhile, telling her young friend, by way of entertainment, of various
      extraordinary love adventures in which she had figured as heroine when
      travelling on the Continent. These stories had one and all a remarkable
      likeness in a certain point-Menlove was always unwilling to love the
      adorer, and the adorer was always unwilling to live afterwards on account
      of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ha-ha-ha!' in men's voices was heard from the distant dining-room as the
      two women went on talking.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And then,' continued Menlove, 'there was that duel I was the cause of
      between the courier and the French valet. Dear me, what a trouble that
      was; yet I could do nothing to prevent it. This courier was a very
      handsome man-they are handsome sometimes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, they are. My aunt married one.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Did she? Where do they live?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'They keep an hotel at Rouen,' murmured Picotee, in doubt whether this
      should have been told or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, he used to follow me to the English Church every Sunday regularly,
      and I was so determined not to give my hand where my heart could never be,
      that I slipped out at the other door while he stood expecting me by the
      one I entered. Here I met M. Pierre, when, as ill luck would have it, the
      other came round the corner, and seeing me talking to the valet, he
      challenged him at once.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ha-ha-ha!' was heard again afar.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Did they fight?' said Picotee.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, I believe they did. We left Nice the next day; but I heard some time
      after of a duel not many miles off, and although I could not get hold of
      the names, I make no doubt it was between those two gentlemen. I never
      knew which of them fell; poor fellow, whichever it was.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!' came from the dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Whatever are those boozy men laughing at, I wonder?' said Menlove. 'They
      are always so noisy when the ladies have gone upstairs. Upon my soul, I'll
      run up and find out.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, no, don't,' entreated Picotee, putting her hand on her entertainer's
      arm. 'It seems wrong; it is no concern of ours.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Wrong be hanged-anything on an impulse,' said Mrs. Menlove, skipping
      across the room and out of the door, which stood open, as did others in
      the house, the evening being sultry and oppressive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Picotee waited in her seat until it occurred to her that she could escape
      the lady's-maid by going off into her father's pantry in her absence. But
      before this had been put into effect Menlove appeared again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Such fun as they are having up there,' she said. 'Somebody asked Mr.
      Neigh to tell a story which he had told at some previous time, but he was
      very reluctant to do so, and pretended he could not recollect it. Well,
      then, the other man-I could not distinguish him by his voice-began telling
      it, to prompt Mr. Neigh's memory; and, as far as I could understand, it
      was about some lady who thought Mr. Neigh was in love with her, and, to
      find whether he was worth accepting or not, she went with her maid at
      night to see his estate, and wandered about and got lost, and was
      frightened, and I don't know what besides. Then Mr. Neigh laughed too, and
      said he liked such common sense in a woman. No names were mentioned, but I
      fancy, from the awkwardness of Mr. Neigh at being compelled to tell it,
      that the lady is one of those in the drawing-room. I should like to know
      which it was.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I know-have heard something about it,' said Picotee, blushing with anger.
      'It was nothing at all like that. I wonder Mr. Neigh had the audacity ever
      to talk of the matter, and to misrepresent it so greatly!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Tell all about it, do,' said Menlove.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no,' said Picotee. 'I promised not to say a word.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is your mistress, I expect.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You may think what you like; but the lady is anything but a mistress of
      mine.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The flighty Menlove pressed her to tell the whole story, but finding this
      useless the subject was changed. Presently her father came in, and, taking
      no notice of Menlove, told his daughter that she had been called for.
      Picotee very readily put on her things, and on going outside found Joey
      awaiting her. Mr. Chickerel followed closely, with sharp glances from the
      corner of his eye, and it was plain from Joey's nervous manner of
      lingering in the shadows of the area doorway instead of entering the
      house, that the butler had in some way set himself to prevent all
      communion between the fair lady's-maid and his son for that evening at
      least.
    </p>
    <p>
      He watched Picotee and her brother off the premises, and the pair went on
      their way towards Exonbury Crescent, very few words passing between them.
      Picotee's thoughts had turned to the proposed visit to Knollsea, and Joey
      was sulky under disappointment and the blank of thwarted purposes.

      30. ON THE HOUSETOP
    </h2>
    <p>
      'Picotee, are you asleep?' Ethelberta whispered softly at dawn the next
      morning, by the half-opened door of her sister's bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, I keep waking, it is so warm.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'So do I. Suppose we get up and see the sun rise. The east is filling with
      flame.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, I should like it,' said Picotee.
    </p>
    <p>
      The restlessness which had brought Ethelberta hither in slippers and
      dressing-gown at such an early hour owed its origin to another cause than
      the warmth of the weather; but of that she did not speak as yet. Picotee's
      room was an attic, with windows in the roof-a chamber dismal enough at all
      times, and very shadowy now. While Picotee was wrapping up, Ethelberta
      placed a chair under the window, and mounting upon this they stepped
      outside, and seated themselves within the parapet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The air was as clear and fresh as on a mountain side; sparrows chattered,
      and birds of a species unsuspected at later hours could be heard singing
      in the park hard by, while here and there on ridges and flats a cat might
      be seen going calmly home from the devilries of the night to resume the
      amiabilities of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am so sorry I was asleep when you reached home,' said Picotee. 'I was
      so anxious to tell you something I heard of, and to know what you did; but
      my eyes would shut, try as I might, and then I tried no longer. Did you
      see me at all, Berta?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never once. I had an impression that you were there. I fancied you were
      from father's carefully vacuous look whenever I glanced at his face. But
      were you careful about what you said, and did you see Menlove? I felt all
      the time that I had done wrong in letting you come; the gratification to
      you was not worth the risk to me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I saw her, and talked to her. But I am certain she suspected nothing. I
      enjoyed myself very much, and there was no risk at all.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am glad it is no worse news. However, you must not go there again: upon
      that point I am determined.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It was a good thing I did go, all the same. I'll tell you why when you
      have told me what happened to you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nothing of importance happened to me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I expect you got to know the lord you were to meet?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O yes-Lord Mountclere.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And it's dreadful how fond he is of you-quite ridiculously taken up with
      you-I saw that well enough. Such an old man, too; I wouldn't have him for
      the world!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't jump at conclusions so absurdly, Picotee. Why wouldn't you have him
      for the world?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Because he is old enough to be my grandfather, and yours too.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Indeed he is not; he is only middle-aged.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O Berta! Sixty-five at least.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He may or may not be that; and if he is, it is not old. He is so
      entertaining that one forgets all about age in connection with him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He laughs like this-"Hee-hee-hee!"' Picotee introduced as much antiquity
      into her face as she could by screwing it up and suiting the action to the
      word.
    </p>
    <p>
      'This very odd thing occurred,' said Ethelberta, to get Picotee off the
      track of Lord Mountclere's peculiarities, as it seemed. 'I was saying to
      Mr. Neigh that we were going to Knollsea for a time, feeling that he would
      not be likely to know anything about such an out-of-the-way place, when
      Lord Mountclere, who was near, said, "I shall be at Enckworth Court in a
      few days, probably at the time you are at Knollsea. The Imperial
      Archaeological Association holds its meetings in that part of Wessex this
      season, and Corvsgate Castle, near Knollsea, is one of the places on our
      list." Then he hoped I should be able to attend. Did you ever hear
      anything so strange? Now, I should like to attend very much, not on Lord
      Mountclere's account, but because such gatherings are interesting, and I
      have never been to one; yet there is this to be considered, would it be
      right for me to go without a friend to such a place? Another point is,
      that we shall live in menagerie style at Knollsea for the sake of the
      children, and we must do it economically in case we accept Aunt
      Charlotte's invitation to Rouen; hence, if he or his friends find us out
      there it will be awkward for me. So the alternative is Knollsea or some
      other place for us.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Let it be Knollsea, now we have once settled it,' said Picotee anxiously.
      'I have mentioned to Faith Julian that we shall be there.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mentioned it already! You must have written instantly.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I had a few minutes to spare, and I thought I might as well write.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very well; we will stick to Knollsea,' said Ethelberta, half in doubt.
      'Yes-otherwise it will be difficult to see about aunt's baptismal
      certificate. We will hope nobody will take the trouble to pry into our
      household. . . . And now, Picotee, I want to ask you something-something
      very serious. How would you like me to marry Mr. Neigh?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta could not help laughing with a faint shyness as she asked the
      question under the searching east ray. 'He has asked me to marry him,' she
      continued, 'and I want to know what you would say to such an arrangement.
      I don't mean to imply that the event is certain to take place; but, as a
      mere supposition, what do you say to it, Picotee?' Ethelberta was far from
      putting this matter before Picotee for advice or opinion; but, like all
      people who have an innate dislike to hole-and-corner policy, she felt
      compelled to speak of it to some one.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I should not like him for you at all,' said Picotee vehemently. 'I would
      rather you had Mr. Ladywell.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, don't name him!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I wouldn't have Mr. Neigh at any price, nevertheless. It is about him
      that I was going to tell you.' Picotee proceeded to relate Menlove's
      account of the story of Ethelberta's escapade, which had been dragged from
      Neigh the previous evening by the friend to whom he had related it before
      he was so enamoured of Ethelberta as to regard that performance as a
      positive virtue in her. 'Nobody was told, or even suspected, who the lady
      of the anecdote was,' Picotee concluded; 'but I knew instantly, of course,
      and I think it very unfortunate that we ever went to that dreadful ghostly
      estate of his, Berta.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta's face heated with mortification. She had no fear that Neigh
      had told names or other particulars which might lead to her identification
      by any friend of his, and she could make allowance for bursts of
      confidence; but there remained the awkward fact that he himself knew her
      to be the heroine of the episode. What annoyed her most was that Neigh
      could ever have looked upon her indiscretion as a humorous incident, which
      he certainly must have done at some time or other to account for his
      telling it. Had he been angry with her, or sneered at her for going, she
      could have forgiven him; but to see her manoeuvre in the light of a joke,
      to use it as illustrating his grim theory of womankind, and neither to
      like nor to dislike her the more for it from first to last, this was to
      treat her with a cynicism which was intolerable. That Neigh's use of the
      incident as a stock anecdote ceased long before he had decided to ask her
      to marry him she had no doubt, but it showed that his love for her was of
      that sort in which passion makes war upon judgment, and prevails in spite
      of will. Moreover, he might have been speaking ironically when he alluded
      to the act as a virtue in a woman, which seemed the more likely when she
      remembered his cool bearing towards her in the drawing-room. Possibly it
      was an antipathetic reaction, induced by the renewed recollection of her
      proceeding.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will never marry Mr. Neigh!' she said, with decision. 'That shall
      settle it. You need not think over any such contingency, Picotee. He is
      one of those horrid men who love with their eyes, the remainder part of
      him objecting all the time to the feeling; and even if his objections
      prove the weaker, and the man marries, his general nature conquers again
      by the time the wedding trip is over, so that the woman is miserable at
      last, and had better not have had him at all.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That applies still more to Lord Mountclere, to my thinking. I never saw
      anything like the look of his eyes upon you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no, no-you understand nothing if you say that. But one thing be sure
      of, there is no marriage likely to take place between myself and Mr.
      Neigh. I have longed for a sound reason for disliking him, and now I have
      got it. Well, we will talk no more of this-let us think of the nice little
      pleasure we have in store-our stay at Knollsea. There we will be as free
      as the wind. And when we are down there, I can drive across to Corvsgate
      Castle if I wish to attend the Imperial Association meeting, and nobody
      will know where I came from. Knollsea is not more than five miles from the
      Castle, I think.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Picotee was by this time beginning to yawn, and Ethelberta did not feel
      nearly so wakeful as she had felt half-an-hour earlier. Tall and swarthy
      columns of smoke were now soaring up from the kitchen chimneys around,
      spreading horizontally when at a great height, and forming a roof of haze
      which was turning the sun to a copper colour, and by degrees spoiling the
      sweetness of the new atmosphere that had rolled in from the country during
      the night, giving it the usual city smell. The resolve to make this rising
      the beginning of a long and busy day, which should set them beforehand
      with the rest of the world, weakened with their growing weariness, and an
      impulse to lie down just for a quarter of an hour before dressing, ended
      in a sound sleep that did not relinquish its hold upon them till late in
      the forenoon.

    <h2>
      31. KNOLLSEA-A LOFTY DOWN-A RUINED CASTLE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Knollsea was a seaside village lying snug within two headlands as between
      a finger and thumb. Everybody in the parish who was not a boatman was a
      quarrier, unless he were the gentleman who owned half the property and had
      been a quarryman, or the other gentleman who owned the other half, and had
      been to sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      The knowledge of the inhabitants was of the same special sort as their
      pursuits. The quarrymen in white fustian understood practical geology, the
      laws and accidents of dips, faults, and cleavage, far better than the ways
      of the world and mammon; the seafaring men in Guernsey frocks had a
      clearer notion of Alexandria, Constantinople, the Cape, and the Indies
      than of any inland town in their own country. This, for them, consisted of
      a busy portion, the Channel, where they lived and laboured, and a dull
      portion, the vague unexplored miles of interior at the back of the ports,
      which they seldom thought of.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some wives of the village, it is true, had learned to let lodgings, and
      others to keep shops. The doors of these latter places were formed of an
      upper hatch, usually kept open, and a lower hatch, with a bell attached,
      usually kept shut. Whenever a stranger went in, he would hear a whispering
      of astonishment from a back room, after which a woman came forward,
      looking suspiciously at him as an intruder, and advancing slowly enough to
      allow her mouth to get clear of the meal she was partaking of. Meanwhile
      the people in the back room would stop their knives and forks in absorbed
      curiosity as to the reason of the stranger's entry, who by this time feels
      ashamed of his unwarrantable intrusion into this hermit's cell, and thinks
      he must take his hat off. The woman is quite alarmed at seeing that he is
      not one of the fifteen native women and children who patronize her, and
      nervously puts her hand to the side of her face, which she carries
      slanting. The visitor finds himself saying what he wants in an apologetic
      tone, when the woman tells him that they did keep that article once, but
      do not now; that nobody does, and probably never will again; and as he
      turns away she looks relieved that the dilemma of having to provide for a
      stranger has passed off with no worse mishap than disappointing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      A cottage which stood on a high slope above this townlet and its bay
      resounded one morning with the notes of a merry company. Ethelberta had
      managed to find room for herself and her young relations in the house of
      one of the boatmen, whose wife attended upon them all. Captain Flower, the
      husband, assisted her in the dinner preparations, when he slipped about
      the house as lightly as a girl and spoke of himself as cook's mate. The
      house was so small that the sailor's rich voice, developed by shouting in
      high winds during a twenty years' experience in the coasting trade, could
      be heard coming from the kitchen between the chirpings of the children in
      the parlour. The furniture of this apartment consisted mostly of the
      painting of a full-rigged ship, done by a man whom the captain had
      specially selected for the purpose because he had been seven-and-twenty
      years at sea before touching a brush, and thereby offered a sufficient
      guarantee that he understood how to paint a vessel properly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before this picture sat Ethelberta in a light linen dress, and with
      tightly-knotted hair-now again Berta Chickerel as of old-serving out
      breakfast to the rest of the party, and sometimes lifting her eyes to the
      outlook from the window, which presented a happy combination of grange
      scenery with marine. Upon the irregular slope between the house and the
      quay was an orchard of aged trees wherein every apple ripening on the
      boughs presented its rubicund side towards the cottage, because that
      building chanced to lie upwards in the same direction as the sun. Under
      the trees were a few Cape sheep, and over them the stone chimneys of the
      village below: outside these lay the tanned sails of a ketch or smack, and
      the violet waters of the bay, seamed and creased by breezes insufficient
      to raise waves; beyond all a curved wall of cliff, terminating in a
      promontory, which was flanked by tall and shining obelisks of chalk rising
      sheer from the trembling blue race beneath.
    </p>
    <p>
      By one sitting in the room that commanded this prospect, a white butterfly
      among the apple-trees might be mistaken for the sails of a yacht far away
      on the sea; and in the evening when the light was dim, what seemed like a
      fly crawling upon the window-pane would turn out to be a boat in the bay.
    </p>
    <p>
      When breakfast was over, Ethelberta sat leaning on the window-sill
      considering her movements for the day. It was the time fixed for the
      meeting of the Imperial Association at Corvsgate Castle, the celebrated
      ruin five miles off, and the meeting had some fascinations for her. For
      one thing, she had never been present at a gathering of the kind, although
      what was left in any shape from the past was her constant interest,
      because it recalled her to herself and fortified her mind. Persons waging
      a harassing social fight are apt in the interest of the combat to forget
      the smallness of the end in view; and the hints that perishing historical
      remnants afforded her of the attenuating effects of time even upon great
      struggles corrected the apparent scale of her own. She was reminded that
      in a strife for such a ludicrously small object as the entry of
      drawing-rooms, winning, equally with losing, is below the zero of the true
      philosopher's concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      There could never be a more excellent reason than this for going to view
      the meagre stumps remaining from flourishing bygone centuries, and it had
      weight with Ethelberta this very day; but it would be difficult to state
      the whole composition of her motive. The approaching meeting had been one
      of the great themes at Mr. Doncastle's dinner-party, and Lord Mountclere,
      on learning that she was to be at Knollsea, had recommended her attendance
      at some, if not all of the meetings, as a desirable and exhilarating
      change after her laborious season's work in town. It was pleasant to have
      won her way so far in high places that her health of body and mind should
      be thus considered-pleasant, less as personal gratification, than that it
      casually reflected a proof of her good judgment in a course which
      everybody among her kindred had condemned by calling a foolhardy
      undertaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she might go without the restraint of ceremony.
      Unconventionality-almost eccentricity-was de rigueur for one who had been
      first heard of as a poetess; from whose red lips magic romance had since
      trilled for weeks to crowds of listeners, as from a perennial spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Ethelberta went, after a considerable pondering how to get there
      without the needless sacrifice either of dignity or cash. It would be
      inconsiderate to the children to spend a pound on a brougham when as much
      as she could spare was wanted for their holiday. It was almost too far too
      walk. She had, however, decided to walk, when she met a boy with a donkey,
      who offered to lend it to her for three shillings. The animal was rather
      sad-looking, but Ethelberta found she could sit upon the pad without
      discomfort. Considering that she might pull up some distance short of the
      castle, and leave the ass at a cottage before joining her four-wheeled
      friends, she struck the bargain and rode on her way.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was, first by a path on the shore where the tide dragged huskily up
      and down the shingle without disturbing it, and thence up the steep crest
      of land opposite, whereon she lingered awhile to let the ass breathe. On
      one of the spires of chalk into which the hill here had been split was
      perched a cormorant, silent and motionless, with wings spread out to dry
      in the sun after his morning's fishing, their white surface shining like
      mail. Retiring without disturbing him and turning to the left along the
      lofty ridge which ran inland, the country on each side lay beneath her
      like a map, domains behind domains, parishes by the score, harbours,
      fir-woods, and little inland seas mixing curiously together. Thence she
      ambled along through a huge cemetery of barrows, containing human dust
      from prehistoric times.
    </p>
    <p>
      Standing on the top of a giant's grave in this antique land, Ethelberta
      lifted her eyes to behold two sorts of weather pervading Nature at the
      same time. Far below on the right hand it was a fine day, and the silver
      sunbeams lighted up a many-armed inland sea which stretched round an
      island with fir-trees and gorse, and amid brilliant crimson heaths wherein
      white paths and roads occasionally met the eye in dashes and zigzags like
      flashes of lightning. Outside, where the broad Channel appeared, a
      berylline and opalized variegation of ripples, currents, deeps, and
      shallows, lay as fair under the sun as a New Jerusalem, the shores being
      of gleaming sand. Upon the radiant heather bees and butterflies were busy,
      she knew, and the birds on that side were just beginning their autumn
      songs.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the left, quite up to her position, was dark and cloudy weather,
      shading a valley of heavy greens and browns, which at its further side
      rose to meet the sea in tall cliffs, suggesting even here at their back
      how terrible were their aspects seaward in a growling southwest gale. Here
      grassed hills rose like knuckles gloved in dark olive, and little
      plantations between them formed a still deeper and sadder monochrome. A
      zinc sky met a leaden sea on this hand, the low wind groaned and whined,
      and not a bird sang.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ridge along which Ethelberta rode divided these two climates like a
      wall; it soon became apparent that they were wrestling for mastery
      immediately in her pathway. The issue long remained doubtful, and this
      being an imaginative hour with her, she watched as typical of her own
      fortunes how the front of battle swayed-now to the west, flooding her with
      sun, now to the east, covering her with shade: then the wind moved round
      to the north, a blue hole appeared in the overhanging cloud, at about the
      place of the north star; and the sunlight spread on both sides of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The towers of the notable ruin to be visited rose out of the furthermost
      shoulder of the upland as she advanced, its site being the slope and crest
      of a smoothly nibbled mount at the toe of the ridge she had followed. When
      observing the previous uncertainty of the weather on this side Ethelberta
      had been led to doubt if the meeting would be held here to-day, and she
      was now strengthened in her opinion that it would not by the total absence
      of human figures amid the ruins, though the time of appointment was past.
      This disposed of another question which had perplexed her: where to find a
      stable for the ass during the meeting, for she had scarcely liked the idea
      of facing the whole body of lords and gentlemen upon the animal's back.
      She now decided to retain her seat, ride round the ruin, and go home
      again, without troubling further about the movements of the Association or
      acquaintance with the members composing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly Ethelberta crossed the bridge over the moat, and rode under
      the first archway into the outer ward. As she had expected, not a soul was
      here. The arrow-slits, portcullis-grooves, and staircases met her eye as
      familiar friends, for in her childhood she had once paid a visit to the
      spot. Ascending the green incline and through another arch into the second
      ward, she still pressed on, till at last the ass was unable to clamber an
      inch further. Here she dismounted, and tying him to a stone which
      projected like a fang from a raw edge of wall, performed the remainder of
      the ascent on foot. Once among the towers above, she became so interested
      in the windy corridors, mildewed dungeons, and the tribe of daws peering
      invidiously upon her from overhead, that she forgot the flight of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearly three-quarters of an hour passed before she came out from the
      immense walls, and looked from an opening to the front over the wide
      expanse of the outer ward, by which she had ascended.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta was taken aback to see there a file of shining carriages, which
      had arrived during her seclusion in the keep. From these began to burst a
      miscellany of many-coloured draperies, blue, buff, pied, and black; they
      united into one, and crept up the incline like a cloud, which then parted
      into fragments, dived into old doorways, and lost substance behind
      projecting piles. Recognizing in this the ladies and gentlemen of the
      meeting, her first thought was how to escape, for she was suddenly
      overcome with dread to meet them all single-handed as she stood. She drew
      back and hurried round to the side, as the laughter and voices of the
      assembly began to be audible, and, more than ever vexed that she could not
      have fallen in with them in some unobtrusive way, Ethelberta found that
      they were immediately beneath her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Venturing to peep forward again, what was her mortification at finding
      them gathered in a ring, round no object of interest belonging to the
      ruin, but round her faithful beast, who had loosened himself in some way
      from the stone, and stood in the middle of a plat of grass, placidly
      regarding them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being now in the teeth of the Association, there was nothing to do but to
      go on, since, if she did not, the next few steps of their advance would
      disclose her. She made the best of it, and began to descend in the broad
      view of the assembly, from the midst of which proceeded a
      laugh-'Hee-hee-hee!' Ethelberta knew that Lord Mountclere was there.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The poor thing has strayed from its owner,' said one lady, as they all
      stood eyeing the apparition of the ass.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It may belong to some of the villagers,' said the President in a
      historical voice: 'and it may be appropriate to mention that many were
      kept here in olden times: they were largely used as beasts of burden in
      victualling the castle previous to the last siege, in the year sixteen
      hundred and forty-five.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is very weary, and has come a long way, I think,' said a lady; adding,
      in an imaginative tone, 'the humble creature looks so aged and is so
      quaintly saddled that we may suppose it to be only an animated relic, of
      the same date as the other remains.'
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time Lord Mountclere had noticed Ethelberta's presence, and
      straightening himself to ten years younger, he lifted his hat in answer to
      her smile, and came up jauntily. It was a good time now to see what the
      viscount was really like. He appeared to be about sixty-five, and the
      dignified aspect which he wore to a gazer at a distance became depreciated
      to jocund slyness upon nearer view, when the small type could be read
      between the leading lines. Then it could be seen that his upper lip
      dropped to a point in the middle, as if impressing silence upon his too
      demonstrative lower one. His right and left profiles were different, one
      corner of his mouth being more compressed than the other, producing a deep
      line thence downwards to the side of his chin. Each eyebrow rose obliquely
      outwards and upwards, and was thus far above the little eye, shining with
      the clearness of a pond that has just been able to weather the heats of
      summer. Below this was a preternaturally fat jowl, which, by thrusting
      against cheeks and chin, caused the arch old mouth to be almost buried at
      the corners.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few words of greeting passed, and Ethelberta told him how she was
      fearing to meet them all, united and primed with their morning's knowledge
      as they appeared to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, we have not done much yet,' said Lord Mountclere. 'As for myself, I
      have given no thought at all to our day's work. I had not forgotten your
      promise to attend, if you could possibly drive across, and-hee-hee-hee!-I
      have frequently looked towards the hill where the road descends. . . .
      Will you now permit me to introduce some of my party-as many of them as
      you care to know by name? I think they would all like to speak to you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta then found herself nominally made known to ten or a dozen
      ladies and gentlemen who had wished for special acquaintance with her. She
      stood there, as all women stand who have made themselves remarkable by
      their originality, or devotion to any singular cause, as a person freed of
      her hampering and inconvenient sex, and, by virtue of her popularity,
      unfettered from the conventionalities of manner prescribed by custom for
      household womankind. The charter to move abroad unchaperoned, which
      society for good reasons grants only to women of three sorts-the famous,
      the ministering, and the improper-Ethelberta was in a fair way to make
      splendid use of: instead of walking in protected lanes she experienced
      that luxury of isolation which normally is enjoyed by men alone, in
      conjunction with the attention naturally bestowed on a woman young and
      fair. Among the presentations were Mr. and Mrs. Tynn, member and member's
      mainspring for North Wessex; Sir Cyril and Lady Blandsbury; Lady Jane Joy;
      and the Honourable Edgar Mountclere, the viscount's brother. There also
      hovered near her the learned Doctor Yore; Mr. Small, a profound writer,
      who never printed his works; the Reverend Mr. Brook, rector; the Very
      Reverend Dr. Taylor, dean; and the undoubtedly Reverend Mr. Tinkleton,
      Nonconformist, who had slipped into the fold by chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      These and others looked with interest at Ethelberta: the old county
      fathers hard, as at a questionable town phenomenon, the county sons
      tenderly, as at a pretty creature, and the county daughters with great
      admiration, as at a lady reported by their mammas to be no better than she
      should be. It will be seen that Ethelberta was the sort of woman that
      well-rooted local people might like to look at on such a free and friendly
      occasion as an archaeological meeting, where, to gratify a pleasant whim,
      the picturesque form of acquaintance is for the nonce preferred to the
      useful, the spirits being so brisk as to swerve from strict attention to
      the select and sequent gifts of heaven, blood and acres, to consider for
      an idle moment the subversive Mephistophelian endowment, brains.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Our progress in the survey of the castle has not been far as yet,' Lord
      Mountclere resumed; 'indeed, we have only just arrived, the weather this
      morning being so unsettled. When you came up we were engaged in a
      preliminary study of the poor animal you see there: how it could have got
      up here we cannot understand.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He pointed as he spoke to the donkey which had brought Ethelberta thither,
      whereupon she was silent, and gazed at her untoward beast as if she had
      never before beheld him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ass looked at Ethelberta as though he would say, 'Why don't you own
      me, after safely bringing you over those weary hills?' But the pride and
      emulation which had made her what she was would not permit her, as the
      most lovely woman there, to take upon her own shoulders the ridicule that
      had already been cast upon the ass. Had he been young and gaily
      caparisoned, she might have done it; but his age, the clumsy trappings of
      rustic make, and his needy woful look of hard servitude, were too much to
      endure.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Many come and picnic here,' she said serenely, 'and the animal may have
      been left till they return from some walk.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'True,' said Lord Mountclere, without the slightest suspicion of the
      truth. The humble ass hung his head in his usual manner, and it demanded
      little fancy from Ethelberta to imagine that he despised her. And then her
      mind flew back to her history and extraction, to her father-perhaps at
      that moment inventing a private plate-powder in an underground pantry-and
      with a groan at her inconsistency in being ashamed of the ass, she said in
      her heart, 'My God, what a thing am I!'
    </p>
    <p>
      They then all moved on to another part of the castle, the viscount busying
      himself round and round her person like the head scraper at a pig-killing;
      and as they went indiscriminately mingled, jesting lightly or talking in
      earnest, she beheld ahead of her the form of Neigh among the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, there could only be one reason on earth for Neigh's presence-her
      remark that she might attend-for Neigh took no more interest in
      antiquities than in the back of the moon. Ethelberta was a little
      flurried; perhaps he had come to scold her, or to treat her badly in that
      indefinable way of his by which he could make a woman feel as nothing
      without any direct act at all. She was afraid of him, and, determining to
      shun him, was thankful that Lord Mountclere was near, to take off the edge
      of Neigh's manner towards her if he approached.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you know in what part of the ruins the lecture is to be given?' she
      said to the viscount.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Wherever you like,' he replied gallantly. 'Do you propose a place, and I
      will get Dr. Yore to adopt it. Say, shall it be here, or where they are
      standing?'
    </p>
    <p>
      How could Ethelberta refrain from exercising a little power when it was
      put into her hands in this way?
    </p>
    <p>
      'Let it be here,' she said, 'if it makes no difference to the meeting.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It shall be,' said Lord Mountclere.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then the lively old nobleman skipped like a roe to the President and
      to Dr. Yore, who was to read the paper on the castle, and they soon
      appeared coming back to where the viscount's party and Ethelberta were
      beginning to seat themselves. The bulk of the company followed, and Dr.
      Yore began.
    </p>
    <p>
      He must have had a countenance of leather-as, indeed, from his colour he
      appeared to have-to stand unmoved in his position, and read, and look up
      to give explanations, without a change of muscle, under the dozens of
      bright eyes that were there converged upon him, like the sticks of a fan,
      from the ladies who sat round him in a semicircle upon the grass. However,
      he went on calmly, and the women sheltered themselves from the heat with
      their umbrellas and sunshades, their ears lulled by the hum of insects,
      and by the drone of the doctor's voice. The reader buzzed on with the
      history of the castle, tracing its development from a mound with a few
      earthworks to its condition in Norman times; he related monkish marvels
      connected with the spot; its resistance under Matilda to Stephen, its
      probable shape while a residence of King John, and the sad story of the
      Damsel of Brittany, sister of his victim Arthur, who was confined here in
      company with the two daughters of Alexander, king of Scotland. He went on
      to recount the confinement of Edward II. herein, previous to his murder at
      Berkeley, the gay doings in the reign of Elizabeth, and so downward
      through time to the final overthrow of the stern old pile. As he
      proceeded, the lecturer pointed with his finger at the various features
      appertaining to the date of his story, which he told with splendid vigour
      when he had warmed to his work, till his narrative, particularly in the
      conjectural and romantic parts, where it became coloured rather by the
      speaker's imagination than by the pigments of history, gathered together
      the wandering thoughts of all. It was easy for him then to meet those fair
      concentred eyes, when the sunshades were thrown back, and complexions
      forgotten, in the interest of the history. The doctor's face was then no
      longer criticized as a rugged boulder, a dried fig, an oak carving, or a
      walnut shell, but became blotted out like a mountain top in a shining haze
      by the nebulous pictures conjured by his tale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the lecture ended, and questions were asked, and individuals of the
      company wandered at will, the light dresses of the ladies sweeping over
      the hot grass and brushing up thistledown which had hitherto lain
      quiescent, so that it rose in a flight from the skirts of each like a
      comet's tail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of Lord Mountclere's party, including himself and Ethelberta,
      wandered now into a cool dungeon, partly open to the air overhead, where
      long arms of ivy hung between their eyes and the white sky. While they
      were here, Lady Jane Joy and some other friends of the viscount told
      Ethelberta that they were probably coming on to Knollsea.
    </p>
    <p>
      She instantly perceived that getting into close quarters in that way might
      be very inconvenient, considering the youngsters she had under her charge,
      and straightway decided upon a point that she had debated for several
      days-a visit to her aunt in Normandy. In London it had been a mere
      thought, but the Channel had looked so tempting from its brink that the
      journey was virtually fixed as soon as she reached Knollsea, and found
      that a little pleasure steamer crossed to Cherbourg once a week during the
      summer, so that she would not have to enter the crowded routes at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am afraid I shall not see you in Knollsea,' she said. 'I am about to go
      to Cherbourg and then to Rouen.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How sorry I am. When do you leave?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'At the beginning of next week,' said Ethelberta, settling the time there
      and then.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Did I hear you say that you were going to Cherbourg and Rouen?' Lord
      Mountclere inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I think to do so,' said Ethelberta.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am going to Normandy myself,' said a voice behind her, and without
      turning she knew that Neigh was standing there.
    </p>
    <p>
      They next went outside, and Lord Mountclere offered Ethelberta his arm on
      the ground of assisting her down the burnished grass slope. Ethelberta,
      taking pity upon him, took it; but the assistance was all on her side; she
      stood like a statue amid his slips and totterings, some of which taxed her
      strength heavily, and her ingenuity more, to appear as the supported and
      not the supporter. The incident brought Neigh still further from his
      retirement, and she learnt that he was one of a yachting party which had
      put in at Knollsea that morning; she was greatly relieved to find that he
      was just now on his way to London, whence he would probably proceed on his
      journey abroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta adhered as well as she could to her resolve that Neigh should
      not speak with her alone, but by dint of perseverance he did manage to
      address her without being overheard.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Will you give me an answer?' said Neigh. 'I have come on purpose.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I cannot just now. I have been led to doubt you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Doubt me? What new wrong have I done?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Spoken jestingly of my visit to Farnfield.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good &mdash;-! I did not speak or think of you. When I told that incident
      I had no idea who the lady was-I did not know it was you till two days
      later, and I at once held my tongue. I vow to you upon my soul and life
      that what I say is true. How shall I prove my truth better than by my
      errand here?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't speak of this now. I am so occupied with other things. I am going
      to Rouen, and will think of it on my way.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am going there too. When do you go?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I shall be in Rouen next Wednesday, I hope.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'May I ask where?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hotel Beau Sejour.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Will you give me an answer there? I can easily call upon you. It is now a
      month and more since you first led me to hope-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I did not lead you to hope-at any rate clearly.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Indirectly you did. And although I am willing to be as considerate as any
      man ought to be in giving you time to think over the question, there is a
      limit to my patience. Any necessary delay I will put up with, but I won't
      be trifled with. I hate all nonsense, and can't stand it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Indeed. Good morning.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But Mrs. Petherwin-just one word.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have nothing to say.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will meet you at Rouen for an answer. I would meet you in Hades for the
      matter of that. Remember this: next Wednesday, if I live, I shall call
      upon you at Rouen.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not say nay.
    </p>
    <p>
      'May I?' he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      'If you will.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But say it shall be an appointment?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very well.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Mountclere was by this time toddling towards them to ask if they
      would come on to his house, Enckworth Court, not very far distant, to
      lunch with the rest of the party. Neigh, having already arranged to go on
      to town that afternoon, was obliged to decline, and Ethelberta thought fit
      to do the same, idly asking Lord Mountclere if Enckworth Court lay in the
      direction of a gorge that was visible where they stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No; considerably to the left,' he said. 'The opening you are looking at
      would reveal the sea if it were not for the trees that block the way. Ah,
      those trees have a history; they are half-a-dozen elms which I planted
      myself when I was a boy. How time flies!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is unfortunate they stand just so as to cover the blue bit of sea.
      That addition would double the value of the view from here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You would prefer the blue sea to the trees?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'In that particular spot I should; they might have looked just as well,
      and yet have hidden nothing worth seeing. The narrow slit would have been
      invaluable there.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'They shall fall before the sun sets, in deference to your opinion,' said
      Lord Mountclere.
    </p>
    <p>
      'That would be rash indeed,' said Ethelberta, laughing, 'when my opinion
      on such a point may be worth nothing whatever.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Where no other is acted upon, it is practically the universal one,' he
      replied gaily.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then Ethelberta's elderly admirer bade her adieu, and away the whole
      party drove in a long train over the hills towards the valley wherein
      stood Enckworth Court. Ethelberta's carriage was supposed by her friends
      to have been left at the village inn, as were many others, and her
      retiring from view on foot attracted no notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      She watched them out of sight, and she also saw the rest depart-those who,
      their interest in archaeology having begun and ended with this spot, had,
      like herself, declined the hospitable viscount's invitation, and started
      to drive or walk at once home again. Thereupon the castle was quite
      deserted except by Ethelberta, the ass, and the jackdaws, now floundering
      at ease again in and about the ivy of the keep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not wishing to enter Knollsea till the evening shades were falling, she
      still walked amid the ruins, examining more leisurely some points which
      the stress of keeping herself companionable would not allow her to attend
      to while the assemblage was present. At the end of the survey, being
      somewhat weary with her clambering, she sat down on the slope commanding
      the gorge where the trees grew, to make a pencil sketch of the landscape
      as it was revealed between the ragged walls. Thus engaged she weighed the
      circumstances of Lord Mountclere's invitation, and could not be certain if
      it were prudishness or simple propriety in herself which had instigated
      her to refuse. She would have liked the visit for many reasons, and if
      Lord Mountclere had been anybody but a remarkably attentive old widower,
      she would have gone. As it was, it had occurred to her that there was
      something in his tone which should lead her to hesitate. Were any among
      the elderly or married ladies who had appeared upon the ground in a
      detached form as she had done-and many had appeared thus-invited to
      Enckworth; and if not, why were they not? That Lord Mountclere admired her
      there was no doubt, and for this reason it behoved her to be careful. His
      disappointment at parting from her was, in one aspect, simply laughable,
      from its odd resemblance to the unfeigned sorrow of a boy of fifteen at a
      first parting from his first love; in another aspect it caused reflection;
      and she thought again of his curiosity about her doings for the remainder
      of the summer.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      While she sketched and thought thus, the shadows grew longer, and the sun
      low. And then she perceived a movement in the gorge. One of the trees
      forming the curtain across it began to wave strangely: it went further to
      one side, and fell. Where the tree had stood was now a rent in the
      foliage, and through the narrow rent could be seen the distant sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta uttered a soft exclamation. It was not caused by the surprise
      she had felt, nor by the intrinsic interest of the sight, nor by want of
      comprehension. It was a sudden realization of vague things hitherto
      dreamed of from a distance only-a sense of novel power put into her hands
      without request or expectation. A landscape was to be altered to suit her
      whim. She had in her lifetime moved essentially larger mountains, but they
      had seemed of far less splendid material than this; for it was the nature
      of the gratification rather than its magnitude which enchanted the fancy
      of a woman whose poetry, in spite of her necessities, was hardly yet
      extinguished. But there was something more, with which poetry had little
      to do. Whether the opinion of any pretty woman in England was of more
      weight with Lord Mountclere than memories of his boyhood, or whether that
      distinction was reserved for her alone; this was a point that she would
      have liked to know.
    </p>
    <p>
      The enjoyment of power in a new element, an enjoyment somewhat resembling
      in kind that which is given by a first ride or swim, held Ethelberta to
      the spot, and she waited, but sketched no more. Another tree-top swayed
      and vanished as before, and the slit of sea was larger still. Her mind and
      eye were so occupied with this matter that, sitting in her nook, she did
      not observe a thin young man, his boots white with the dust of a long
      journey on foot, who arrived at the castle by the valley-road from
      Knollsea. He looked awhile at the ruin, and, skirting its flank instead of
      entering by the great gateway, climbed up the scarp and walked in through
      a breach. After standing for a moment among the walls, now silent and
      apparently empty, with a disappointed look he descended the slope, and
      proceeded along on his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta, who was in quite another part of the castle, saw the black
      spot diminishing to the size of a fly as he receded along the dusty road,
      and soon after she descended on the other side, where she remounted the
      ass, and ambled homeward as she had come, in no bright mood. What, seeing
      the precariousness of her state, was the day's triumph worth after all,
      unless, before her beauty abated, she could ensure her position against
      the attacks of chance?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       'To be thus is nothing;
    But to be safely thus.'
</pre>
    <p>
      -she said it more than once on her journey that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      On entering the sitting-room of their cot up the hill she found it empty,
      and from a change perceptible in the position of small articles of
      furniture, something unusual seemed to have taken place in her absence.
      The dwelling being of that sort in which whatever goes on in one room is
      audible through all the rest, Picotee, who was upstairs, heard the arrival
      and came down. Picotee's face was rosed over with the brilliance of some
      excitement. 'What do you think I have to tell you, Berta?' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have no idea,' said her sister. 'Surely,' she added, her face
      intensifying to a wan sadness, 'Mr. Julian has not been here?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' said Picotee. 'And we went down to the sands-he, and Myrtle, and
      Georgina, and Emmeline, and I-and Cornelia came down when she had put away
      the dinner. And then we dug wriggles out of the sand with Myrtle's spade:
      we got such a lot, and had such fun; they are in a dish in the kitchen.
      Mr. Julian came to see you; but at last he could wait no longer, and when
      I told him you were at the meeting in the castle ruins he said he would
      try to find you there on his way home, if he could get there before the
      meeting broke up.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then it was he I saw far away on the road-yes, it must have been.' She
      remained in gloomy reverie a few moments, and then said, 'Very well-let it
      be. Picotee, get me some tea: I do not want dinner.'
    </p>
    <p>
      But the news of Christopher's visit seemed to have taken away her appetite
      for tea also, and after sitting a little while she flung herself down upon
      the couch, and told Picotee that she had settled to go and see their aunt
      Charlotte.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am going to write to Sol and Dan to ask them to meet me there,' she
      added. 'I want them, if possible, to see Paris. It will improve them
      greatly in their trades, I am thinking, if they can see the kinds of
      joinery and decoration practised in France. They agreed to go, if I should
      wish it, before we left London. You, of course, will go as my maid.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Picotee gazed upon the sea with a crestfallen look, as if she would rather
      not cross it in any capacity just then.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It would scarcely be worth going to the expense of taking me, would it?'
      she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cause of Picotee's sudden sense of economy was so plain that her
      sister smiled; but young love, however foolish, is to a thinking person
      far too tragic a power for ridicule; and Ethelberta forbore, going on as
      if Picotee had not spoken: 'I must have you with me. I may be seen there:
      so many are passing through Rouen at this time of the year. Cornelia can
      take excellent care of the children while we are gone. I want to get out
      of England, and I will get out of England. There is nothing but vanity and
      vexation here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am sorry you were away when he called,' said Picotee gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, I don't mean that. I wish there were no different ranks in the world,
      and that contrivance were not a necessary faculty to have at all. Well, we
      are going to cross by the little steamer that puts in here, and we are
      going on Monday.' She added in another minute, 'What had Mr. Julian to
      tell us that he came here? How did he find us out?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I mentioned that we were coming here in my letter to Faith. Mr. Julian
      says that perhaps he and his sister may also come for a few days before
      the season is over. I should like to see Miss Julian again. She is such a
      nice girl.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes.' Ethelberta played with her hair, and looked at the ceiling as she
      reclined. 'I have decided after all,' she said, 'that it will be better to
      take Cornelia as my maid, and leave you here with the children. Cornelia
      is stronger as a companion than you, and she will be delighted to go. Do
      you think you are competent to keep Myrtle and Georgina out of harm's
      way?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O yes-I will be exceedingly careful,' said Picotee, with great vivacity.
      'And if there is time I can go on teaching them a little.' Then Picotee
      caught Ethelberta's eye, and colouring red, sank down beside her sister,
      whispering, 'I know why it is! But if you would rather have me with you I
      will go, and not once wish to stay.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta looked as if she knew all about that, and said, 'Of course
      there will be no necessity to tell the Julians about my departure until
      they have fixed the time for coming, and cannot alter their minds.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The sound of the children with Cornelia, and their appearance outside the
      window, pushing between the fuchsia bushes which overhung the path, put an
      end to this dialogue; they entered armed with buckets and spades, a very
      moist and sandy aspect pervading them as far up as the high-water mark of
      their clothing, and began to tell Ethelberta of the wonders of the deep.

      32. A ROOM IN ENCKWORTH COURT
    </h2>
    <h3>
      'Are you sure the report is true?'
    </h3>
    <p>
      'I am sure that what I say is true, my lord; but it is hardly to be called
      a report. It is a secret, known at present to nobody but myself and Mrs.
      Doncastle's maid.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The speaker was Lord Mountclere's trusty valet, and the conversation was
      between him and the viscount in a dressing-room at Enckworth Court, on the
      evening after the meeting of archaeologists at Corvsgate Castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      'H'm-h'm; the daughter of a butler. Does Mrs. Doncastle know of this yet,
      or Mr. Neigh, or any of their friends?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, my lord.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are quite positive?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Quite positive. I was, by accident, the first that Mrs. Menlove named the
      matter to, and I told her it might be much to her advantage if she took
      particular care it should go no further.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mrs. Menlove! Who's she?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The lady's-maid at Mrs. Doncastle's, my lord.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, ah-of course. You may leave me now, Tipman.' Lord Mountclere remained
      in thought for a moment. 'A clever little puss, to hoodwink us all like
      this-hee-hee!' he murmured. 'Her education-how finished; and her beauty-so
      seldom that I meet with such a woman. Cut down my elms to please a
      butler's daughter-what a joke-certainly a good joke! To interest me in her
      on the right side instead of the wrong was strange. But it can be made to
      change sides-hee-hee!-it can be made to change sides! Tipman!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Tipman came forward from the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Will you take care that that piece of gossip you mentioned to me is not
      repeated in this house? I strongly disapprove of talebearing of any sort,
      and wish to hear no more of this. Such stories are never true. Answer
      me-do you hear? Such stories are never true.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I beg pardon, but I think your lordship will find this one true,' said
      the valet quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then where did she get her manners and education? Do you know?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I do not, my lord. I suppose she picked 'em up by her wits.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never mind what you suppose,' said the old man impatiently. 'Whenever I
      ask a question of you tell me what you know, and no more.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Quite so, my lord. I beg your lordship's pardon for supposing.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'H'm-h'm. Have the fashion-books and plates arrived yet?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Le Follet has, my lord; but not the others.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Let me have it at once. Always bring it to me at once. Are there any
      handsome ones this time?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'They are much the same class of female as usual, I think, my lord,' said
      Tipman, fetching the paper and laying it before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, they are,' said the viscount, leaning back and scrutinizing the
      faces of the women one by one, and talking softly to himself in a way that
      had grown upon him as his age increased. 'Yet they are very well: that one
      with her shoulder turned is pure and charming-the brown-haired one will
      pass. All very harmless and innocent, but without character; no soul, or
      inspiration, or eloquence of eye. What an eye was hers! There is not a
      girl among them so beautiful. . . . Tipman! Come and take it away. I don't
      think I will subscribe to these papers any longer-how long have I
      subscribed? Never mind-I take no interest in these things, and I suppose I
      must give them up. What white article is that I see on the floor yonder?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I can see nothing, my lord.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, yes, you can. At the other end of the room. It is a white
      handkerchief. Bring it to me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I beg pardon, my lord, but I cannot see any white handkerchief.
      Whereabouts does your lordship mean?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'There in the corner. If it is not a handkerchief, what is it? Walk along
      till you come to it-that is it; now a little further-now your foot is
      against it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O that-it is not anything. It is the light reflected against the
      skirting, so that it looks like a white patch of something-that is all.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'H'm-hm. My eyes-how weak they are! I am getting old, that's what it is: I
      am an old man.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no, my lord.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, an old man.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, we shall all be old some day, and so will your lordship, I suppose;
      but as yet-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I tell you I am an old man!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, my lord-I did not mean to contradict. An old man in one sense-old in
      a young man's sense, but not in a house-of-parliament or historical sense.
      A little oldish-I meant that, my lord.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I may be an old man in one sense or in another sense in your mind; but
      let me tell you there are men older than I-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, so there are, my lord.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'People may call me what they please, and you may be impertinent enough to
      repeat to me what they say, but let me tell you I am not a very old man
      after all. I am not an old man.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Old in knowledge of the world I meant, my lord, not in years.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, yes. Experience of course I cannot be without. And I like what is
      beautiful. Tipman, you must go to Knollsea; don't send, but go yourself,
      as I wish nobody else to be concerned in this. Go to Knollsea, and find
      out when the steamboat for Cherbourg starts; and when you have done that,
      I shall want you to send Taylor to me. I wish Captain Strong to bring the
      Fawn round into Knollsea Bay. Next week I may want you to go to Cherbourg
      in the yacht with me-if the Channel is pretty calm-and then perhaps to
      Rouen and Paris. But I will speak of that to-morrow.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very good, my lord.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Meanwhile I recommend that you and Mrs. Menlove repeat nothing you may
      have heard concerning the lady you just now spoke of. Here is a slight
      present for Mrs. Menlove; and accept this for yourself.' He handed money.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Your lordship may be sure we will not,' the valet replied.

    <h2>
      33. THE ENGLISH CHANNEL-NORMANDY
    </h2>
    <p>
      On Monday morning the little steamer Speedwell made her appearance round
      the promontory by Knollsea Bay, to take in passengers for the transit to
      Cherbourg. Breezes the freshest that could blow without verging on
      keenness flew over the quivering deeps and shallows; and the sunbeams
      pierced every detail of barrow, path and rabbit-run upon the lofty
      convexity of down and waste which shut in Knollsea from the world to the
      west.
    </p>
    <p>
      They left the pier at eight o'clock, taking at first a short easterly
      course to avoid a sinister ledge of limestones jutting from the water like
      crocodile's teeth, which first obtained notoriety in English history
      through being the spot whereon a formidable Danish fleet went to pieces a
      thousand years ago. At the moment that the Speedwell turned to enter upon
      the direct course, a schooner-yacht, whose sheets gleamed like bridal
      satin, loosed from a remoter part of the bay; continuing to bear off, she
      cut across the steamer's wake, and took a course almost due southerly,
      which was precisely that of the Speedwell. The wind was very favourable
      for the yacht, blowing a few points from north in a steady pressure on her
      quarter, and, having been built with every modern appliance that
      shipwrights could offer, the schooner found no difficulty in getting
      abreast, and even ahead, of the steamer, as soon as she had escaped the
      shelter of the hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      The more or less parallel courses of the vessels continued for some time
      without causing any remark among the people on board the Speedwell. At
      length one noticed the fact, and another; and then it became the general
      topic of conversation in the group upon the bridge, where Ethelberta, her
      hair getting frizzed and her cheeks carnationed by the wind, sat upon a
      camp-stool looking towards the prow.
    </p>
    <p>
      'She is bound for Guernsey,' said one. 'In half-an-hour she will put about
      for a more westerly course, you'll see.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She is not for Guernsey or anywhere that way,' said an acquaintance,
      looking through his glass. 'If she is out for anything more than a morning
      cruise, she is bound for our port. I should not wonder if she is crossing
      to get stocked, as most of them do, to save the duty on her wine and
      provisions.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you know whose yacht it is?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I do not.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta looked at the light leaning figure of the pretty schooner,
      which seemed to skate along upon her bilge and make white shavings of all
      the sea that touched her. She at first imagined that this might be the
      yacht Neigh had arrived in at the end of the previous week, for she knew
      that he came as one of a yachting party, and she had noticed no other boat
      of that sort in the bay since his arrival. But as all his party had gone
      ashore and not yet returned, she was surprised to see the supposed vessel
      here. To add to her perplexity, she could not be positive, now that it
      came to a real nautical query, whether the craft of Neigh's friends had
      one mast or two, for she had caught but a fragmentary view of the topsail
      over the apple-trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is that the yacht which has been lying at Knollsea for the last few
      days?' she inquired of the master of the Speedwell, as soon as she had an
      opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The master warmed beneath his copper-coloured rind. 'O no, miss; that one
      you saw was a cutter-a smaller boat altogether,' he replied. 'Built on the
      sliding-keel principle, you understand, miss-and red below her water-line,
      if you noticed. This is Lord Mountclere's yacht-the Fawn. You might have
      seen her re'ching in round Old-Harry Rock this morning afore we started.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lord Mountclere's?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes-a nobleman of this neighbourhood. But he don't do so much at yachting
      as he used to in his younger days. I believe he's aboard this morning,
      however.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta now became more absorbed than ever in their ocean comrade, and
      watched its motions continually. The schooner was considerably in advance
      of them by this time, and seemed to be getting by degrees out of their
      course. She wondered if Lord Mountclere could be really going to
      Cherbourg: if so, why had he said nothing about the trip to her when she
      spoke of her own approaching voyage thither? The yacht changed its
      character in her eyes; losing the indefinite interest of the unknown, it
      acquired the charm of a riddle on motives, of which the alternatives were,
      had Lord Mountclere's journey anything to do with her own, or had it not?
      Common probability pointed to the latter supposition; but the time of
      starting, the course of the yacht, and recollections of Lord Mountclere's
      homage, suggested the more extraordinary possibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went across to Cornelia. 'The man who handed us on board-didn't I see
      him speaking to you this morning?' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O yes,' said Cornelia. 'He asked if my mistress was the popular Mrs.
      Petherwin?
    </p>
    <p>
      'And you told him, I suppose?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What made you do that, Cornelia?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I thought I might: I couldn't help it. When I went through the toll-gate,
      such a gentlemanly-looking man asked me if he should help me to carry the
      things to the end of the pier; and as we went on together he said he
      supposed me to be Mrs. Petherwin's maid. I said, "Yes." The two men met
      afterwards, so there would ha' been no good in my denying it to one of
      'em.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who was this gentlemanly person?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I asked the other man that, and he told me one of Lord Mountclere's upper
      servants. I knew then there was no harm in having been civil to him. He is
      well-mannered, and talks splendid language.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That yacht you see on our right hand is Lord Mountclere's property. If I
      do not mistake, we shall have her closer by-and-by, and you may meet your
      gentlemanly friend again. Be careful how you talk to him.'
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Ethelberta sat down, thought of the meeting at Corvsgate Castle, of the
dinner-party at Mr. Doncastle's, of the strange position she had there
been in, and then of her father. She suddenly reproached herself for
thoughtlessness; for in her pocket lay a letter from him, which she had
taken from the postman that morning at the moment of coming from the
door, and in the hurry of embarking had forgotten ever since. Opening it
quickly, she read:-

    'MY DEAR ETHELBERTA,-Your letter reached me yesterday, and I called round at Exonbury Crescent in the afternoon, as you wished.  Everything is going on right there, and you have no occasion to be anxious about them.  I do not leave town for another week or two, and by the time I am gone Sol and Dan will have returned from Paris, if your mother and Gwendoline want any help: so that you need not hurry back on their account.

    'I have something else to tell you, which is not quite so satisfactory, and it is this that makes me write at once; but do not be alarmed.  It began in this way.  A few nights after the dinner-party here I was determined to find out if there was any truth in what you had been told about that boy, and having seen Menlove go out as usual after dark, I followed her.  Sure enough, when she had got into the park, up came master Joe, smoking a cigar.  As soon as they had met I went towards them, and Menlove, seeing somebody draw nigh, began to edge off, when the blockhead said, "Never mind, my love, it is only the old man."  Being very provoked with both of them, though she was really the most to blame, I gave him some smart cuts across the shoulders with my cane, and told him to go home, which he did with a flea in his ear, the rascal.  I believe I have cured his courting tricks for some little time.

    'Well, Menlove then walked by me, quite cool, as if she were merely a lady passing by chance at the time, which provoked me still more, knowing the whole truth of it, and I could not help turning upon her and saying, "You, madam, ought to be served the same way."  She replied in very haughty words, and I walked away, saying that I had something better to do than argue with a woman of her character at that hour of the evening.  This so set her up that she followed me home, marched into my pantry, and told me that if I had been more careful about my manners in calling her a bad character, it might have been better both for me and my stuck-up daughter-a daw in eagle's plumes-and so on.  Now it seems that she must have coaxed something out of Joey about you-for what lad in the world could be a match for a woman of her experience and arts!  I hope she will do you no serious damage; but I tell you the whole state of affairs exactly as they are, that you may form your own opinions.  After all, there is no real disgrace, for none of us have ever done wrong, but have worked honestly for a living.  However, I will let you know if anything serious really happens.'
</pre>
    <p>
      This was all that her father said on the matter, the letter concluding
      with messages to the children and directions from their mother with regard
      to their clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta felt very distinctly that she was in a strait; the old
      impression that, unless her position were secured soon, it never would be
      secured, returned with great force. A doubt whether it was worth securing
      would have been very strong ere this, had not others besides herself been
      concerned in her fortunes. She looked up from her letter, and beheld the
      pertinacious yacht; it led her up to a conviction that therein lay a means
      and an opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing further of importance occurred in crossing. Ethelberta's head
      ached after a while, and Cornelia's healthy cheeks of red were found to
      have diminished their colour to the size of a wafer and the quality of a
      stain. The Speedwell entered the breakwater at Cherbourg to find the
      schooner already in the roadstead; and by the time the steamer was brought
      up Ethelberta could see the men on board the yacht clewing up and making
      things snug in a way from which she inferred that they were not going to
      leave the harbour again that day. With the aspect of a fair galleon that
      could easily out-manoeuvre her persevering buccaneer, Ethelberta passed
      alongside. Could it be possible that Lord Mountclere had on her account
      fixed this day for his visit across the Channel?
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I would rather be haunted by him than by Mr. Neigh,' she said; and
      began laying her plans so as to guard against inconvenient surprises.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning Ethelberta was at the railway station, taking tickets for
      herself and Cornelia, when she saw an old yet sly and somewhat merry-faced
      Englishman a little way off. He was attended by a younger man, who
      appeared to be his valet.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will exchange one of these tickets,' she said to the clerk, and having
      done so she went to Cornelia to inform her that it would after all be
      advisable for them to travel separate, adding, 'Lord Mountclere is in the
      station, and I think he is going on by our train. Remember, you are my
      maid again now. Is not that the gentlemanly man who assisted you
      yesterday?' She signified the valet as she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is,' said Cornelia.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the passengers were taking their seats, and Ethelberta was thinking
      whether she might not after all enter a second-class with Cornelia instead
      of sitting solitary in a first because of an old man's proximity, she
      heard a shuffling at her elbow, and the next moment found that he was
      overtly observing her as if he had not done so in secret at all. She at
      once gave him an unsurprised gesture of recognition. 'I saw you some time
      ago; what a singular coincidence,' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'A charming one,' said Lord Mountclere, smiling a half-minute smile, and
      making as if he would take his hat off and would not quite. 'Perhaps we
      must not call it coincidence entirely,' he continued; 'my journey, which I
      have contemplated for some time, was not fixed this week altogether
      without a thought of your presence on the road-hee-hee! Do you go far
      to-day?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'As far as Caen,' said Ethelberta.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah! That's the end of my day's journey, too,' said Lord Mountclere. They
      parted and took their respective places, Lord Mountclere choosing a
      compartment next to the one Ethelberta was entering, and not, as she had
      expected, attempting to join her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now she had instantly fancied when the viscount was speaking that there
      were signs of some departure from his former respectful manner towards
      her; and an enigma lay in that. At their earlier meetings he had never
      ventured upon a distinct coupling of himself and herself as he had done in
      his broad compliment to-day-if compliment it could be called. She was not
      sure that he did not exceed his license in telling her deliberately that
      he had meant to hover near her in a private journey which she was taking
      without reference to him. She did not object to the act, but to the avowal
      of the act; and, being as sensitive as a barometer on signs affecting her
      social condition, it darted upon Ethelberta for one little moment that he
      might possibly have heard a word or two about her being nothing more nor
      less than one of a tribe of thralls; hence his freedom of manner.
      Certainly a plain remark of that sort was exactly what a susceptible peer
      might be supposed to say to a pretty woman of far inferior degree. A rapid
      redness filled her face at the thought that he might have smiled upon her
      as upon a domestic whom he was disposed to chuck under the chin. 'But no,'
      she said. 'He would never have taken the trouble to follow and meet with
      me had he learnt to think me other than a lady. It is extremity of
      devotion-that's all.'
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not Ethelberta's inexperience, but that her conception of self
      precluded such an association of ideas, which led her to dismiss the
      surmise that his attendance could be inspired by a motive beyond that of
      paying her legitimate attentions as a co-ordinate with him and his in the
      social field. Even if he only meant flirtation, she read it as of that
      sort from which courtship with an eye to matrimony differs only in degree.
      Hence, she thought, his interest in her was not likely, under the ordinary
      influences of caste feeling, to continue longer than while he was kept in
      ignorance of her consanguinity with a stock proscribed. She sighed at the
      anticipated close of her full-feathered towering when her ties and bonds
      should be uncovered. She might have seen matters in a different light, and
      sighed more. But in the stir of the moment it escaped her thought that
      ignorance of her position, and a consequent regard for her as a woman of
      good standing, would have prevented his indulgence in any course which was
      open to the construction of being disrespectful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Valognes, Carentan, Isigny, Bayeux, were passed, and the train drew up at
      Caen. Ethelberta's intention had been to stay here for one night, but
      having learnt from Lord Mountclere, as previously described, that this was
      his destination, she decided to go on. On turning towards the carriage
      after a few minutes of promenading at the Caen station, she was surprised
      to perceive that Lord Mountclere, who had alighted as if to leave, was
      still there.
    </p>
    <p>
      They spoke again to each other. 'I find I have to go further,' he suddenly
      said, when she had chatted with him a little time. And beckoning to the
      man who was attending to his baggage, he directed the things to be again
      placed in the train.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time passed, and they changed at the next junction. When Ethelberta
      entered a carriage on the branch line to take her seat for the remainder
      of the journey, there sat the viscount in the same division. He explained
      that he was going to Rouen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta came to a quick resolution. Her audacity, like that of a child
      getting nearer and nearer a parent's side, became wonderfully vigorous as
      she approached her destination; and though there were three good hours of
      travel to Rouen as yet, the heavier part of the journey was past. At her
      aunt's would be a safe refuge, play what pranks she might, and there she
      would to-morrow meet those bravest of defenders Sol and Dan, to whom she
      had sent as much money as she could conveniently spare towards their
      expenses, with directions that they were to come by the most economical
      route, and meet her at the house of her aunt, Madame Moulin, previous to
      their educational trip to Paris, their own contribution being the value of
      the week's work they would have to lose. Thus backed up by Sol and Dan,
      her aunt, and Cornelia, Ethelberta felt quite the reverse of a lonely
      female persecuted by a wicked lord in a foreign country. 'He shall pay for
      his weaknesses, whatever they mean,' she thought; 'and what they mean I
      will find out at once.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am going to Paris,' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You cannot to-night, I think.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'To-morrow, I mean.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I should like to go on to-morrow. Perhaps I may. So that there is a
      chance of our meeting again.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes; but I do not leave Rouen till the afternoon. I first shall go to the
      cathedral, and drive round the city.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Mountclere smiled pleasantly. There seemed a sort of encouragement in
      her words. Ethelberta's thoughts, however, had flown at that moment to the
      approaching situation at her aunt's hotel: it would be extremely
      embarrassing if he should go there.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Where do you stay, Lord Mountclere?' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus directly asked, he could not but commit himself to the name of the
      hotel he had been accustomed to patronize, which was one in the upper part
      of the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mine is not that one,' said Ethelberta frigidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      No further remark was made under this head, and they conversed for the
      remainder of the daylight on scenery and other topics, Lord Mountclere's
      air of festivity lending him all the qualities of an agreeable companion.
      But notwithstanding her resolve, Ethelberta failed, for that day at least,
      to make her mind clear upon Lord Mountclere's intentions. To that end she
      would have liked first to know what were the exact limits set by society
      to conduct under present conditions, if society had ever set any at all,
      which was open to question: since experience had long ago taught her that
      much more freedom actually prevails in the communion of the sexes than is
      put on paper as etiquette, or admitted in so many words as correct
      behaviour. In short, everything turned upon whether he had learnt of her
      position when off the platform at Mayfair Hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wearied with these surmises, and the day's travel, she closed her eyes.
      And then her enamoured companion more widely opened his, and traced the
      beautiful features opposite him. The arch of the brows-like a slur in
      music-the droop of the lashes, the meeting of the lips, and the sweet
      rotundity of the chin-one by one, and all together, they were adored, till
      his heart was like a retort full of spirits of wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a warm evening, and when they arrived at their journey's end
      distant thunder rolled behind heavy and opaque clouds. Ethelberta bade
      adieu to her attentive satellite, called to Cornelia, and entered a cab;
      but before they reached the inn the thunder had increased. Then a cloud
      cracked into flame behind the iron spire of the cathedral, showing in
      relief its black ribs and stanchions, as if they were the bars of a
      blazing cresset held on high.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, we will clamber up there to-morrow,' said Ethelberta.
    </p>
    <p>
      A wondrous stillness pervaded the streets of the city after this, though
      it was not late; and their arrival at M. Moulin's door was quite an event
      for the quay. No rain came, as they had expected, and by the time they
      halted the western sky had cleared, so that the newly-lit lamps on the
      quay, and the evening glow shining over the river, inwove their harmonious
      rays as the warp and woof of one lustrous tissue. Before they had alighted
      there appeared from the archway Madame Moulin in person, followed by the
      servants of the hotel in a manner signifying that they did not receive a
      visitor once a fortnight, though at that moment the clatter of sixty
      knives, forks, and tongues was audible through an open window from the
      adjoining dining-room, to the great interest of a group of idlers outside.
      Ethelberta had not seen her aunt since she last passed through the town
      with Lady Petherwin, who then told her that this landlady was the only
      respectable relative she seemed to have in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Charlotte's face was an English outline filled in with French shades
      under the eyes, on the brows, and round the mouth, by the natural effect
      of years; she resembled the British hostess as little as well could be, no
      point in her causing the slightest suggestion of drops taken for the
      stomach's sake. Telling the two young women she would gladly have met them
      at the station had she known the hour of their arrival, she kissed them
      both without much apparent notice of a difference in their conditions;
      indeed, seeming rather to incline to Cornelia, whose country face and
      homely style of clothing may have been more to her mind than Ethelberta's
      finished travelling-dress, a class of article to which she appeared to be
      well accustomed. Her husband was at this time at the head of the
      table-d'hote, and mentioning the fact as an excuse for his non-appearance,
      she accompanied them upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the strain of keeping up smiles with Lord Mountclere, the rattle and
      shaking, and the general excitements of the chase across the water and
      along the rail, a face in which she saw a dim reflex of her mother's was
      soothing in the extreme, and Ethelberta went up to the staircase with a
      feeling of expansive thankfulness. Cornelia paused to admire the clean
      court and the small caged birds sleeping on their perches, the boxes of
      veronica in bloom, of oleander, and of tamarisk, which freshened the air
      of the court and lent a romance to the lamplight, the cooks in their paper
      caps and white blouses appearing at odd moments from an Avernus behind;
      while the prompt 'v'la!' of teetotums in mob caps, spinning down the
      staircase in answer to the periodic clang of bells, filled her with
      wonder, and pricked her conscience with thoughts of how seldom such
      transcendent nimbleness was attempted by herself in a part so nearly
      similar.

      34. THE HOTEL BEAU SEJOUR AND SPOTS NEAR IT
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
The next day, much to Ethelberta's surprise, there was a letter for her
in her mother's up-hill hand. She neglected all the rest of its contents
for the following engrossing sentences:-

    'Menlove has wormed everything out of poor Joey, we find, and your father is much upset about it.  She had another quarrel with him, and then declared she would expose you and us to Mrs. Doncastle and all your friends.  I think that Menlove is the kind of woman who will stick to her word, and the question for you to consider is, how can you best face out any report of the truth which she will spread, and contradict the lies that she will add to it?  It appears to me to be a dreadful thing, and so it will probably appear to you.  The worst part will be that your sisters and brothers are your servants, and that your father is actually engaged in the house where you dine.  I am dreadful afraid that this will be considered a fine joke for gossips, and will cause no end of laughs in society at your expense.  At any rate, should Menlove spread the report, it would absolutely prevent people from attending your lectures next season, for they would feel like dupes, and be angry with theirselves, and you, and all of us.

    'The only way out of the muddle that I can see for you is to put some scheme of marrying into effect as soon as possible, and before these things are known.  Surely by this time, with all your opportunities, you have been able to strike up an acquaintance with some gentleman or other, so as to make a suitable match.  You see, my dear Berta, marriage is a thing which, once carried out, fixes you more firm in a position than any personal brains can do; for as you stand at present, every loose tooth, and every combed-out hair, and every new wrinkle, and every sleepless night, is so much took away from your chance for the future, depending as it do upon your skill in charming.  I know that you have had some good offers, so do listen to me, and warm up the best man of them again a bit, and get him to repeat his words before your roundness shrinks away, and 'tis too late.

    'Mr. Ladywell has called here to see you; it was just after I had heard that this Menlove might do harm, so I thought I could do no better than send down word to him that you would much like to see him, and were wondering sadly why he had not called lately.  I gave him your address at Rouen, that he might find you, if he chose, at once, and be got to propose, since he is better than nobody.  I believe he said, directly Joey gave him the address, that he was going abroad, and my opinion is that he will come to you, because of the encouragement I gave him.  If so, you must thank me for my foresight and care for you.

    'I heave a sigh of relief sometimes at the thought that I, at any rate, found a husband before the present man-famine began.  Don't refuse him this time, there's a dear, or, mark my words, you'll have cause to rue it-unless you have beforehand got engaged to somebody better than he.  You will not if you have not already, for the exposure is sure to come soon.'
</pre>
    <p>
      'O, this false position!-it is ruining your nature, my too thoughtful
      mother! But I will not accept any of them-I'll brazen it out!' said
      Ethelberta, throwing the letter wherever it chose to fly, and picking it
      up to read again. She stood and thought it all over. 'I must decide to do
      something!' was her sigh again; and, feeling an irresistible need of
      motion, she put on her things and went out to see what resolve the morning
      would bring.
    </p>
    <p>
      No rain had fallen during the night, and the air was now quiet in a warm
      heavy fog, through which old cider-smells, reminding her of Wessex,
      occasionally came from narrow streets in the background. Ethelberta passed
      up the Rue Grand-Pont into the little dusky Rue Saint-Romain, behind the
      cathedral, being driven mechanically along by the fever and fret of her
      thoughts. She was about to enter the building by the transept door, when
      she saw Lord Mountclere coming towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta felt equal to him, or a dozen such, this morning. The looming
      spectres raised by her mother's information, the wearing sense of being
      over-weighted in the race, were driving her to a Hamlet-like fantasticism
      and defiance of augury; moreover, she was abroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am about to ascend to the parapets of the cathedral,' said she, in
      answer to a half inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I should be delighted to accompany you,' he rejoined, in a manner as
      capable of explanation by his knowledge of her secret as was Ethelberta's
      manner by her sense of nearing the end of her maying. But whether this
      frequent glide into her company was meant as ephemeral flirtation, to fill
      the half-hours of his journey, or whether it meant a serious
      love-suit-which were the only alternatives that had occurred to her on the
      subject-did not trouble her now. 'I am bound to be civil to so great a
      lord,' she lightly thought, and expressing no objection to his presence,
      she passed with him through the outbuildings, containing Gothic lumber
      from the shadowy pile above, and ascended the stone staircase. Emerging
      from its windings, they duly came to the long wooden ladder suspended in
      mid-air that led to the parapet of the tower. This being wide enough for
      two abreast, she could hardly do otherwise than wait a moment for the
      viscount, who up to this point had never faltered, and who amused her as
      they went by scraps of his experience in various countries, which, to do
      him justice, he told with vivacity and humour. Thus they reached the end
      of the flight, and entered behind a balustrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The prospect will be very lovely from this point when the fog has blown
      off,' said Lord Mountclere faintly, for climbing and chattering at the
      same time had fairly taken away his breath. He leant against the masonry
      to rest himself. 'The air is clearing already; I fancy I saw a sunbeam or
      two.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It will be lovelier above,' said Ethelberta. 'Let us go to the platform
      at the base of the fleche, and wait for a view there.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'With all my heart,' said her attentive companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      They passed in at a door and up some more stone steps, which landed them
      finally in the upper chamber of the tower. Lord Mountclere sank on a beam,
      and asked smilingly if her ambition was not satisfied with this goal. 'I
      recollect going to the top some years ago,' he added, 'and it did not
      occur to me as being a thing worth doing a second time. And there was no
      fog then, either.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O,' said Ethelberta, 'it is one of the most splendid things a person can
      do! The fog is going fast, and everybody with the least artistic feeling
      in the direction of bird's-eye views makes the ascent every time of coming
      here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of course, of course,' said Lord Mountclere. 'And I am only too happy to
      go to any height with you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Since you so kindly offer, we will go to the very top of the spire-up
      through the fog and into the sunshine,' said Ethelberta.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Mountclere covered a grim misgiving by a gay smile, and away they
      went up a ladder admitting to the base of the huge iron framework above;
      then they entered upon the regular ascent of the cage, towards the
      hoped-for celestial blue, and among breezes which never descended so low
      as the town. The journey was enlivened with more breathless witticisms
      from Lord Mountclere, till she stepped ahead of him again; when he asked
      how many more steps there were.
    </p>
    <p>
      She inquired of the man in the blue blouse who accompanied them.
      'Fifty-five,' she returned to Lord Mountclere a moment later.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went round, and round, and yet around.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How many are there now?' Lord Mountclere demanded this time of the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      'A hundred and ninety, Monsieur,' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But there were only fifty-five ever so long ago!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Two hundred and five, then,' said the man. 'Perhaps the mist prevented
      Mademoiselle hearing me distinctly?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never mind: I would follow were there five thousand more, did
      Mademoiselle bid me!' said the exhausted nobleman gallantly, in English.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hush!' said Ethelberta, with displeasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He doesn't understand a word,' said Lord Mountclere.
    </p>
    <p>
      They paced the remainder of their spiral pathway in silence, and having at
      last reached the summit, Lord Mountclere sank down on one of the steps,
      panting out, 'Dear me, dear me!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta leaned and looked around, and said, 'How extraordinary this is.
      It is sky above, below, everywhere.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He dragged himself together and stepped to her side. They formed as it
      were a little world to themselves, being completely ensphered by the fog,
      which here was dense as a sea of milk. Below was neither town, country,
      nor cathedral-simply whiteness, into which the iron legs of their gigantic
      perch faded to nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      'We have lost our labour; there is no prospect for you, after all, Lord
      Mountclere,' said Ethelberta, turning her eyes upon him. He looked at her
      face as if there were, and she continued, 'Listen; I hear sounds from the
      town: people's voices, and carts, and dogs, and the noise of a
      railway-train. Shall we now descend, and own ourselves disappointed?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Whenever you choose.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Before they had put their intention in practice there appeared to be
      reasons for waiting awhile. Out of the plain of fog beneath, a stone tooth
      seemed to be upheaving itself: then another showed forth. These were the
      summits of the St. Romain and the Butter Towers-at the western end of the
      building. As the fog stratum collapsed other summits manifested their
      presence further off-among them the two spires and lantern of St. Ouen's;
      when to the left the dome of St. Madeline's caught a first ray from the
      peering sun, under which its scaly surface glittered like a fish. Then the
      mist rolled off in earnest, and revealed far beneath them a whole city,
      its red, blue, and grey roofs forming a variegated pattern, small and
      subdued as that of a pavement in mosaic. Eastward in the spacious outlook
      lay the hill of St. Catherine, breaking intrusively into the large level
      valley of the Seine; south was the river which had been the parent of the
      mist, and the Ile Lacroix, gorgeous in scarlet, purple, and green. On the
      western horizon could be dimly discerned melancholy forests, and further
      to the right stood the hill and rich groves of Boisguillaume.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta having now done looking around, the descent was begun and
      continued without intermission till they came to the passage behind the
      parapet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta was about to step airily forward, when there reached her ear
      the voices of persons below. She recognized as one of them the slow
      unaccented tones of Neigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Please wait a minute!' she said in a peremptory manner of confusion
      sufficient to attract Lord Mountclere's attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      A recollection had sprung to her mind in a moment. She had half made an
      appointment with Neigh at her aunt's hotel for this very week, and here
      was he in Rouen to keep it. To meet him while indulging in this vagary
      with Lord Mountclere-which, now that the mood it had been engendered by
      was passing off, she somewhat regretted-would be the height of imprudence.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I should like to go round to the other side of the parapet for a few
      moments,' she said, with decisive quickness. 'Come with me, Lord
      Mountclere.'
    </p>
    <p>
      They went round to the other side. Here she kept the viscount and their
      suisse until she deemed it probable that Neigh had passed by, when she
      returned with her companions and descended to the bottom. They emerged
      into the Rue Saint-Romain, whereupon a woman called from the opposite side
      of the way to their guide, stating that she had told the other English
      gentleman that the English lady had gone into the fleche.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta turned and looked up. She could just discern Neigh's form upon
      the steps of the fleche above, ascending toilsomely in search of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What English gentleman could that have been?' said Lord Mountclere, after
      paying the man. He spoke in a way which showed he had not overlooked her
      confusion. 'It seems that he must have been searching for us, or rather
      for you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Only Mr. Neigh,' said Ethelberta. 'He told me he was coming here. I
      believe he is waiting for an interview with me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'H'm,' said Lord Mountclere.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Business-only business,' said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Shall I leave you? Perhaps the business is important-most important.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Unfortunately it is.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You must forgive me this once: I cannot help-will you give me permission
      to make a difficult remark?' said Lord Mountclere, in an impatient voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      'With pleasure.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, then, the business I meant was-an engagement to be married.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Had it been possible for a woman to be perpetually on the alert she might
      now have supposed that Lord Mountclere knew all about her; a mechanical
      deference must have restrained such an illusion had he seen her in any
      other light than that of a distracting slave. But she answered quietly,
      'So did I.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But how does he know-dear me, dear me! I beg pardon,' said the viscount.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him curiously, as if to imply that he was seriously out of
      his reckoning in respect of her if he supposed that he would be allowed to
      continue this little play at love-making as long as he chose, when she was
      offered the position of wife by a man so good as Neigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stood in silence side by side till, much to her ease, Cornelia
      appeared at the corner waiting. At the last moment he said, in somewhat
      agitated tones, and with what appeared to be a renewal of the respect
      which had been imperceptibly dropped since they crossed the Channel, 'I
      was not aware of your engagement to Mr. Neigh. I fear I have been acting
      mistakenly on that account.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'There is no engagement as yet,' said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Mountclere brightened like a child. 'Then may I have a few words in
      private-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not now-not to-day,' said Ethelberta, with a certain irritation at she
      knew not what. 'Believe me, Lord Mountclere, you are mistaken in many
      things. I mean, you think more of me than you ought. A time will come when
      you will despise me for this day's work, and it is madness in you to go
      further.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Mountclere, knowing what he did know, may have imagined what she
      referred to; but Ethelberta was without the least proof that he had the
      key to her humour. 'Well, well, I'll be responsible for the madness,' he
      said. 'I know you to be-a famous woman, at all events; and that's enough.
      I would say more, but I cannot here. May I call upon you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'When shall I?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If you must, let it be a month hence at my house in town,' she said
      indifferently, the Hamlet mood being still upon her. 'Yes, call upon us
      then, and I will tell you everything that may remain to be told, if you
      should be inclined to listen. A rumour is afloat which will undeceive you
      in much, and depress me to death. And now I will walk back: pray excuse
      me.' She entered the street, and joined Cornelia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Mountclere paced irregularly along, turned the corner, and went
      towards his inn, nearing which his tread grew lighter, till he scarcely
      seemed to touch the ground. He became gleeful, and said to himself,
      nervously palming his hip with his left hand, as if previous to plunging
      it into hot water for some prize: 'Upon my life I've a good mind! Upon my
      life I have!. . . . I must make a straightforward thing of it, and at
      once; or he will have her. But he shall not, and I will-hee-hee!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The fascinated man, screaming inwardly with the excitement, glee, and
      agony of his position, entered the hotel, wrote a hasty note to Ethelberta
      and despatched it by hand, looked to his dress and appearance, ordered a
      carriage, and in a quarter of an hour was being driven towards the Hotel
      Beau Sejour, whither his note had preceded him.

    <h2>
      35. THE HOTEL (continued), AND THE QUAY IN FRONT
    </h2>
    <p>
      Ethelberta, having arrived there some time earlier, had gone straight to
      her aunt, whom she found sitting behind a large ledger in the office,
      making up the accounts with her husband, a well-framed reflective man with
      a grey beard. M. Moulin bustled, waited for her remarks and replies, and
      made much of her in a general way, when Ethelberta said, what she had
      wanted to say instantly, 'Has a gentleman called Mr. Neigh been here?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O yes-I think it is Neigh-there's a card upstairs,' replied her aunt. 'I
      told him you were alone at the cathedral, and I believe he walked that
      way. Besides that one, another has come for you-a Mr. Ladywell, and he is
      waiting.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not for me?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, indeed. I thought he seemed so anxious, under a sort of assumed
      calmness, that I recommended him to remain till you came in.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Goodness, aunt; why did you?' Ethelberta said, and thought how much her
      mother's sister resembled her mother in doings of that sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I thought he had some good reason for seeing you. Are these men
      intruders, then?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no-a woman who attempts a public career must expect to be treated as
      public property: what would be an intrusion on a domiciled gentlewoman is
      a tribute to me. You cannot have celebrity and sex-privilege both.' Thus
      Ethelberta laughed off the awkward conjuncture, inwardly deploring the
      unconscionable maternal meddling which had led to this, though not
      resentfully, for she had too much staunchness of heart to decry a parent's
      misdirected zeal. Had the clanship feeling been universally as strong as
      in the Chickerel family, the fable of the well-bonded fagot might have
      remained unwritten.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ladywell had sent her a letter about getting his picture of herself
      engraved for an illustrated paper, and she had not replied, considering
      that she had nothing to do with the matter, her form and feature having
      been given in the painting as no portrait at all, but as those of an
      ideal. To see him now would be vexatious; and yet it was chilly and formal
      to an ungenerous degree to keep aloof from him, sitting lonely in the same
      house. 'A few weeks hence,' she thought, 'when Menlove's disclosures make
      me ridiculous, he may slight me as a lackey's girl, an upstart, an
      adventuress, and hardly return my bow in the street. Then I may wish I had
      given him no personal cause for additional bitterness.' So, putting off
      the fine lady, Ethelberta thought she would see Ladywell at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ladywell was unaffectedly glad to meet her; so glad, that Ethelberta
      wished heartily, for his sake, there could be warm friendship between
      herself and him, as well as all her lovers, without that insistent
      courtship-and-marriage question, which sent them all scattering like
      leaves in a pestilent blast, at enmity with one another. She was less
      pleased when she found that Ladywell, after saying all there was to say
      about his painting, gently signified that he had been misinformed, as he
      believed, concerning her future intentions, which had led to his absenting
      himself entirely from her; the remark being of course, a natural product
      of her mother's injudicious message to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She cut him short with terse candour. 'Yes,' she said, 'a false report is
      in circulation. I am not yet engaged to be married to any one, if that is
      your meaning.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Ladywell looked cheerful at this frank answer, and said tentatively, 'Am I
      forgotten?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No; you are exactly as you always were in my mind.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then I have been cruelly deceived. I was guided too much by appearances,
      and they were very delusive. I am beyond measure glad I came here to-day.
      I called at your house and learnt that you were here; and as I was going
      out of town, in any indefinite direction, I settled then to come this way.
      What a happy idea it was! To think of you now-and I may be permitted to-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Assuredly you may not. How many times I have told you that!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But I do not wish for any formal engagement,' said Ladywell quickly,
      fearing she might commit herself to some expression of positive denial,
      which he could never surmount. 'I'll wait-I'll wait any length of time.
      Remember, you have never absolutely forbidden my-friendship. Will you
      delay your answer till some time hence, when you have thoroughly
      considered; since I fear it may be a hasty one now?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, indeed; it may be hasty.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You will delay it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'When shall it be?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Say a month hence. I suggest that, because by that time you will have
      found an answer in your own mind: strange things may happen before then.
      "She shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them; and
      she shall seek them, but shall not find them; then shall she say, I will
      go and return to my first"-however, that's no matter.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What-did you-?' Ladywell began, altogether bewildered by this.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is a passage in Hosea which came to my mind, as possibly applicable to
      myself some day,' she answered. 'It was mere impulse.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ha-ha!-a jest-one of your romances broken loose. There is no law for
      impulse: that is why I am here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus fancifully they conversed till the interview concluded. Getting her
      to promise that she would see him again, Ladywell retired to a
      sitting-room on the same landing, in which he had been writing letters
      before she came up. Immediately upon this her aunt, who began to suspect
      that something peculiar was in the wind, came to tell her that Mr. Neigh
      had been inquiring for her again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Send him in,' said Ethelberta.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neigh's footsteps approached, and the well-known figure entered.
      Ethelberta received him smilingly, for she was getting so used to awkward
      juxtapositions that she treated them quite as a natural situation. She
      merely hoped that Ladywell would not hear them talking through the
      partition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neigh scarcely said anything as a beginning: she knew his errand
      perfectly; and unaccountable as it was to her, the strange and
      unceremonious relationship between them, that had originated in the
      peculiar conditions of their first close meeting, was continued now as
      usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Have you been able to bestow a thought on the question between us? I hope
      so,' said Neigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is no use,' said Ethelberta. 'Wait a month, and you will not require
      an answer. You will not mind speaking low, because of a person in the next
      room?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not at all.-Why will that be?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I might say; but let us speak of something else.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't see how we can,' said Neigh brusquely. 'I had no other reason on
      earth for calling here. I wished to get the matter settled, and I could
      not be satisfied without seeing you. I hate writing on matters of this
      sort. In fact I can't do it, and that's why I am here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He was still speaking when an attendant entered with a note.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
'Will you excuse me one moment?' said Ethelberta, stepping to the window
and opening the missive. It contained these words only, in a scrawl so
full of deformities that she could hardly piece its meaning together:-

    'I must see you again to-day unless you absolutely deny yourself to me, which I shall take as a refusal to meet me any more.  I will arrive, punctually, five minutes after you receive this note.  Do pray be alone if you can, and eternally gratify,-Yours,

    'MOUNTCLERE.'
</pre>
    <p>
      'If anything has happened I shall be pleased to wait,' said Neigh, seeing
      her concern when she had closed the note.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no, it is nothing,' said Ethelberta precipitately. 'Yet I think I will
      ask you to wait,' she added, not liking to dismiss Neigh in a hurry; for
      she was not insensible to his perseverance in seeking her over all these
      miles of sea and land; and secondly, she feared that if he were to leave
      on the instant he might run into the arms of Lord Mountclere and Ladywell.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I shall be only too happy to stay till you are at leisure,' said Neigh,
      in the unimpassioned delivery he used whether his meaning were a trite
      compliment or the expression of his most earnest feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I may be rather a long time,' said Ethelberta dubiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My time is yours.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta left the room and hurried to her aunt, exclaiming, 'O, Aunt
      Charlotte, I hope you have rooms enough to spare for my visitors, for they
      are like the fox, the goose, and the corn, in the riddle; I cannot leave
      them together, and I can only be with one at a time. I want the nicest
      drawing-room you have for an interview of a bare two minutes with an old
      gentleman. I am so sorry this has happened, but it is not altogether my
      fault! I only arranged to see one of them; but the other was sent to me by
      mother, in a mistake, and the third met with me on my journey: that's the
      explanation. There's the oldest of them just come.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked through the glass partition, and under the arch of the
      court-gate, as the wheels of the viscount's carriage were heard outside.
      Ethelberta ascended to a room on the first floor, Lord Mountclere was
      shown up, and the door closed upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this time Neigh was very comfortably lounging in an arm-chair in
      Ethelberta's room on the second floor. This was a pleasant enough way of
      passing the minutes with such a tender interview in prospect; and as he
      leant he looked with languid and luxurious interest through the open
      casement at the spars and rigging of some luggers on the Seine, the
      pillars of the suspension bridge, and the scenery of the Faubourg St.
      Sever on the other side of the river. How languid his interest might
      ultimately have become there is no knowing; but there soon arose upon his
      ear the accents of Ethelberta in low distinctness from somewhere outside
      the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes; the scene is pleasant to-day,' she said. 'I like a view over a
      river.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I should think the steamboats are objectionable when they stop here,'
      said another person.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neigh's face closed in to an aspect of perplexity. 'Surely that cannot be
      Lord Mountclere?' he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had he been certain that Ethelberta was only talking to a stranger, Neigh
      would probably have felt their conversation to be no business of his, much
      as he might have been surprised to find her giving audience to another man
      at such a place. But his impression that the voice was that of his
      acquaintance, Lord Mountclere, coupled with doubts as to its possibility,
      was enough to lead him to rise from the chair and put his head out of the
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon a balcony beneath him were the speakers, as he had
      suspected-Ethelberta and the viscount.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking right and left, he saw projecting from the next window the head of
      his friend Ladywell, gazing right and left likewise, apparently just drawn
      out by the same voice which had attracted himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What-you, Neigh!-how strange,' came from Ladywell's lips before he had
      time to recollect that great coolness existed between himself and Neigh on
      Ethelberta's account, which had led to the reduction of their intimacy to
      the most attenuated of nods and good-mornings ever since the
      Harlequin-rose incident at Cripplegate.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes; it is rather strange,' said Neigh, with saturnine evenness. 'Still a
      fellow must be somewhere.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Each then looked over his window-sill downwards, upon the speakers who had
      attracted them thither.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Mountclere uttered something in a low tone which did not reach the
      young men; to which Ethelberta replied, 'As I have said, Lord Mountclere,
      I cannot give you an answer now. I must consider what to do with Mr. Neigh
      and Mr. Ladywell. It is too sudden for me to decide at once. I could not
      do so until I have got home to England, when I will write you a letter,
      stating frankly my affairs and those of my relatives. I shall not consider
      that you have addressed me on the subject of marriage until, having
      received my letter, you-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Repeat my proposal,' said Lord Mountclere.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'My dear Mrs. Petherwin, it is as good as repeated! But I have no right to
      assume anything you don't wish me to assume, and I will wait. How long is
      it that I am to suffer in this uncertainty?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A month. By that time I shall have grown weary of my other two suitors.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A month! Really inflexible?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta had returned inside the window, and her answer was inaudible.
      Ladywell and Neigh looked up, and their eyes met. Both had been reluctant
      to remain where they stood, but they were too fascinated to instantly
      retire. Neigh moved now, and Ladywell did the same. Each saw that the face
      of his companion was flushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Come in and see me,' said Ladywell quickly, before quite withdrawing his
      head. 'I am staying in this room.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will,' said Neigh; and taking his hat he left Ethelberta's apartment
      forthwith.
    </p>
    <p>
      On entering the quarters of his friend he found him seated at a table
      whereon writing materials were strewn. They shook hands in silence, but
      the meaning in their looks was enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Just let me write a note, Ladywell, and I'm your man,' said Neigh then,
      with the freedom of an old acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I was going to do the same thing,' said Ladywell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neigh then sat down, and for a minute or two nothing was to be heard but
      the scratching of a pair of pens, ending on the one side with a more
      boisterous scratch, as the writer shaped 'Eustace Ladywell,' and on the
      other with slow firmness in the characters 'Alfred Neigh.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'There's for you, my fair one,' said Neigh, closing and directing his
      letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yours is for Mrs. Petherwin? So is mine,' said Ladywell, grasping the
      bell-pull. 'Shall I direct it to be put on her table with this one?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Thanks.' And the two letters went off to Ethelberta's sitting-room, which
      she had vacated to receive Lord Mountclere in an empty one beneath.
      Neigh's letter was simply a pleading of a sudden call away which prevented
      his waiting till she should return; Ladywell's, though stating the same
      reason for leaving, was more of an upbraiding nature, and might almost
      have told its reader, were she to take the trouble to guess, that he knew
      of the business of Lord Mountclere with her to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now, let us get out of this place,' said Neigh. He proceeded at once down
      the stairs, followed by Ladywell, who-settling his account at the bureau
      without calling for a bill, and directing his portmanteau to be sent to
      the Right-bank railway station-went with Neigh into the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had not walked fifty yards up the quay when two British workmen, in
      holiday costume, who had just turned the corner of the Rue Jeanne d'Arc,
      approached them. Seeing him to be an Englishman, one of the two addressed
      Neigh, saying, 'Can you tell us the way, sir, to the Hotel Bold Soldier?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Neigh pointed out the place he had just come from to the tall young men,
      and continued his walk with Ladywell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ladywell was the first to break silence. 'I have been considerably misled,
      Neigh,' he said; 'and I imagine from what has just happened that you have
      been misled too.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Just a little,' said Neigh, bringing abstracted lines of meditation into
      his face. 'But it was my own fault: for I ought to have known that these
      stage and platform women have what they are pleased to call Bohemianism so
      thoroughly engrained with their natures that they are no more constant to
      usage in their sentiments than they are in their way of living. Good Lord,
      to think she has caught old Mountclere! She is sure to have him if she
      does not dally with him so long that he gets cool again.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A beautiful creature like her to think of marrying such an infatuated
      idiot as he!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He can give her a title as well as younger men. It will not be the first
      time that such matches have been made.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I can't believe it,' said Ladywell vehemently. 'She has too much poetry
      in her-too much good sense; her nature is the essence of all that's
      romantic. I can't help saying it, though she has treated me cruelly.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She has good looks, certainly. I'll own to that. As for her romance and
      good-feeling, that I leave to you. I think she has treated you no more
      cruelly, as you call it, than she has me, come to that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She told me she would give me an answer in a month,' said Ladywell
      emotionally.
    </p>
    <p>
      'So she told me,' said Neigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And so she told him,' said Ladywell.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And I have no doubt she will keep her word to him in her usual precise
      manner.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But see what she implied to me! I distinctly understood from her that the
      answer would be favourable.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'So did I.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'So does he.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And he is sure to be the one who gets it, since only one of us can. Well,
      I wouldn't marry her for love, money, nor-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Offspring.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Exactly: I would not. "I'll give you an answer in a month"-to all three
      of us! For God's sake let's sit down here and have something to drink.'
    </p>
    <p>
      They drew up a couple of chairs to one of the tables of a wine-shop close
      by, and shouted to the waiter with the vigour of persons going to the
      dogs. Here, behind the horizontal-headed trees that dotted this part of
      the quay, they sat over their bottles denouncing womankind till the sun
      got low down upon the river, and the houses on the further side began to
      be toned by a blue mist. At last they rose from their seats and departed,
      Neigh to dine and consider his route, and Ladywell to take the train for
      Dieppe.
    </p>
    <p>
      While these incidents had been in progress the two workmen had found their
      way into the hotel where Ethelberta was staying. Passing through the
      entrance, they stood at gaze in the court, much perplexed as to the door
      to be made for; the difficulty was solved by the appearance of Cornelia,
      who in expectation of them had been for the last half-hour leaning over
      the sill of her bed-room window, which looked into the interior, amusing
      herself by watching the movements to and fro in the court beneath.
    </p>
    <p>
      After conversing awhile in undertones as if they had no real right there
      at all, Cornelia told them she would call their sister, if an old
      gentleman who had been to see her were gone again. Cornelia then ran away,
      and Sol and Dan stood aloof, till they had seen the old gentleman alluded
      to go to the door and drive off, shortly after which Ethelberta ran down
      to meet them.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Whatever have you got as your luggage?' she said, after hearing a few
      words about their journey, and looking at a curious object like a huge
      extended accordion with bellows of gorgeous-patterned carpeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I thought to myself,' said Sol, ''tis a terrible bother about
      carrying our things. So what did I do but turn to and make a carpet-bag
      that would hold all mine and Dan's too. This, you see, Berta, is a deal
      top and bottom out of three-quarter stuff, stained and varnished. Well,
      then you see I've got carpet sides tacked on with these brass nails, which
      make it look very handsome; and so when my bag is empty 'twill shut up and
      be only a couple of boards under yer arm, and when 'tis open it will hold
      a'most anything you like to put in it. That portmantle didn't cost more
      than three half-crowns altogether, and ten pound wouldn't ha' got anything
      so strong from a portmantle maker, would it, Dan?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, no.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And then you see, Berta,' Sol continued in the same earnest tone, and
      further exhibiting the article, 'I've made this trap-door in the top with
      hinges and padlock complete, so that-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am afraid it is tiring you after your journey to explain all this to
      me,' said Ethelberta gently, noticing that a few Gallic smilers were
      gathering round. 'Aunt has found a nice room for you at the top of the
      staircase in that corner-"Escalier D" you'll see painted at the bottom-and
      when you have been up come across to me at number thirty-four on this
      side, and we'll talk about everything.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Look here, Sol,' said Dan, who had left his brother and gone on to the
      stairs. 'What a rum staircase-the treads all in little blocks, and painted
      chocolate, as I am alive!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am afraid I shall not be able to go on to Paris with you, after all,'
      Ethelberta continued to Sol. 'Something has just happened which makes it
      desirable for me to return at once to England. But I will write a list of
      all you are to see, and where you are to go, so that it will make little
      difference, I hope.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes before this time Ethelberta had been frankly and earnestly
      asked by Lord Mountclere to become his bride; not only so, but he pressed
      her to consent to have the ceremony performed before they returned to
      England. Ethelberta had unquestionably been much surprised; and, barring
      the fact that the viscount was somewhat ancient in comparison with
      herself, the temptation to close with his offer was strong, and would have
      been felt as such by any woman in the position of Ethelberta, now a little
      reckless by stress of circumstances, and tinged with a bitterness of
      spirit against herself and the world generally. But she was experienced
      enough to know what heaviness might result from a hasty marriage, entered
      into with a mind full of concealments and suppressions which, if told,
      were likely to stop the marriage altogether; and after trying to bring
      herself to speak of her family and situation to Lord Mountclere as he
      stood, a certain caution triumphed, and she concluded that it would be
      better to postpone her reply till she could consider which of two courses
      it would be advisable to adopt; to write and explain to him, or to explain
      nothing and refuse him. The third course, to explain nothing and hasten
      the wedding, she rejected without hesitation. With a pervading sense of
      her own obligations in forming this compact it did not occur to her to ask
      if Lord Mountclere might not have duties of explanation equally with
      herself, though bearing rather on the moral than the social aspects of the
      case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her resolution not to go on to Paris was formed simply because Lord
      Mountclere himself was proceeding in that direction, which might lead to
      other unseemly rencounters with him had she, too, persevered in her
      journey. She accordingly gave Sol and Dan directions for their guidance to
      Paris and back, starting herself with Cornelia the next day to return
      again to Knollsea, and to decide finally and for ever what to do in the
      vexed question at present agitating her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never before in her life had she treated marriage in such a terribly cool
      and cynical spirit as she had done that day; she was almost frightened at
      herself in thinking of it. How far any known system of ethics might excuse
      her on the score of those curious pressures which had been brought to bear
      upon her life, or whether it could excuse her at all, she had no spirit to
      inquire. English society appeared a gloomy concretion enough to abide in
      as she contemplated it on this journey home; yet, since its gloominess was
      less an essential quality than an accident of her point of view, that
      point of view she had determined to change.
    </p>
    <p>
      There lay open to her two directions in which to move. She might annex
      herself to the easy-going high by wedding an old nobleman, or she might
      join for good and all the easy-going low, by plunging back to the level of
      her family, giving up all her ambitions for them, settling as the wife of
      a provincial music-master named Julian, with a little shop of fiddles and
      flutes, a couple of old pianos, a few sheets of stale music pinned to a
      string, and a narrow back parlour, wherein she would wait for the
      phenomenon of a customer. And each of these divergent grooves had its
      fascinations, till she reflected with regard to the first that, even
      though she were a legal and indisputable Lady Mountclere, she might be
      despised by my lord's circle, and left lone and lorn. The intermediate
      path of accepting Neigh or Ladywell had no more attractions for her taste
      than the fact of disappointing them had qualms for her conscience; and how
      few these were may be inferred from her opinion, true or false, that two
      words about the spigot on her escutcheon would sweep her lovers'
      affections to the antipodes. She had now and then imagined that her
      previous intermarriage with the Petherwin family might efface much besides
      her surname, but experience proved that the having been wife for a few
      weeks to a minor who died in his father's lifetime, did not weave such a
      tissue of glory about her course as would resist a speedy undoing by
      startling confessions on her station before her marriage, and her
      environments now.

      36. THE HOUSE IN TOWN
    </h2>
    <p>
      Returning by way of Knollsea, where she remained a week or two, Ethelberta
      appeared one evening at the end of September before her house in Exonbury
      Crescent, accompanied by a pair of cabs with the children and luggage; but
      Picotee was left at Knollsea, for reasons which Ethelberta explained when
      the family assembled in conclave. Her father was there, and began telling
      her of a surprising change in Menlove-an unasked-for concession to their
      cause, and a vow of secrecy which he could not account for, unless any
      friend of Ethelberta's had bribed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no-that cannot be,' said she. Any influence of Lord Mountclere to that
      effect was the last thing that could enter her thoughts. 'However, what
      Menlove does makes little difference to me now.' And she proceeded to
      state that she had almost come to a decision which would entirely alter
      their way of living.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I hope it will not be of the sort your last decision was,' said her
      mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No; quite the reverse. I shall not live here in state any longer. We will
      let the house throughout as lodgings, while it is ours; and you and the
      girls must manage it. I will retire from the scene altogether, and stay
      for the winter at Knollsea with Picotee. I want to consider my plans for
      next year, and I would rather be away from town. Picotee is left there,
      and I return in two days with the books and papers I require.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What are your plans to be?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am going to be a schoolmistress-I think I am.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A schoolmistress?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. And Picotee returns to the same occupation, which she ought never to
      have forsaken. We are going to study arithmetic and geography until
      Christmas; then I shall send her adrift to finish her term as
      pupil-teacher, while I go into a training-school. By the time I have to
      give up this house I shall just have got a little country school.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But,' said her mother, aghast, 'why not write more poems and sell 'em?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why not be a governess as you were?' said her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why not go on with your tales at Mayfair Hall?' said Gwendoline.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll answer as well as I can. I have decided to give up romancing because
      I cannot think of any more that pleases me. I have been trying at Knollsea
      for a fortnight, and it is no use. I will never be a governess again: I
      would rather be a servant. If I am a schoolmistress I shall be entirely
      free from all contact with the great, which is what I desire, for I hate
      them, and am getting almost as revolutionary as Sol. Father, I cannot
      endure this kind of existence any longer; I sleep at night as if I had
      committed a murder: I start up and see processions of people, audiences,
      battalions of lovers obtained under false pretences-all denouncing me with
      the finger of ridicule. Mother's suggestion about my marrying I followed
      out as far as dogged resolution would carry me, but during my journey here
      I have broken down; for I don't want to marry a second time among people
      who would regard me as an upstart or intruder. I am sick of ambition. My
      only longing now is to fly from society altogether, and go to any hovel on
      earth where I could be at peace.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What-has anybody been insulting you?' said Mrs. Chickerel.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes; or rather I sometimes think he may have: that is, if a proposal of
      marriage is only removed from being a proposal of a very different kind by
      an accident.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A proposal of marriage can never be an insult,' her mother returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I think otherwise,' said Ethelberta.
    </p>
    <p>
      'So do I,' said her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Unless the man was beneath you, and I don't suppose he was that,' added
      Mrs. Chickerel.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are quite right; he was not that. But we will not talk of this branch
      of the subject. By far the most serious concern with me is that I ought to
      do some good by marriage, or by heroic performance of some kind; while
      going back to give the rudiments of education to remote hamleteers will do
      none of you any good whatever.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never you mind us,' said her father; 'mind yourself.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I shall hardly be minding myself either, in your opinion, by doing that,'
      said Ethelberta dryly. 'But it will be more tolerable than what I am doing
      now. Georgina, and Myrtle, and Emmeline, and Joey will not get the
      education I intended for them; but that must go, I suppose.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How full of vagaries you are,' said her mother. 'Why won't it do to
      continue as you are? No sooner have I learnt up your schemes, and got
      enough used to 'em to see something in 'em, than you must needs bewilder
      me again by starting some fresh one, so that my mind gets no rest at all.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta too keenly felt the justice of this remark, querulous as it
      was, to care to defend herself. It was hopeless to attempt to explain to
      her mother that the oscillations of her mind might arise as naturally from
      the perfection of its balance, like those of a logan-stone, as from
      inherent lightness; and such an explanation, however comforting to its
      subject, was little better than none to simple hearts who only could look
      to tangible outcrops.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Really, Ethelberta,' remonstrated her mother, 'this is very odd. Making
      yourself miserable in trying to get a position on our account is one
      thing, and not necessary; but I think it ridiculous to rush into the other
      extreme, and go wilfully down in the scale. You may just as well exercise
      your wits in trying to swim as in trying to sink.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes; that's what I think,' said her father. 'But of course Berta knows
      best.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I think so too,' said Gwendoline.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And so do I,' said Cornelia. 'If I had once moved about in large circles
      like Ethelberta, I wouldn't go down and be a schoolmistress-not I.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I own it is foolish-suppose it is,' said Ethelberta wearily, and with a
      readiness of misgiving that showed how recent and hasty was the scheme.
      'Perhaps you are right, mother; anything rather than retreat. I wonder if
      you are right! Well, I will think again of it to-night. Do not let us
      speak more about it now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She did think of it that night, very long and painfully. The arguments of
      her relatives seemed ponderous as opposed to her own inconsequent longing
      for escape from galling trammels. If she had stood alone, the sentiment
      that she had begun to build but was not able to finish, by whomsoever it
      might have been entertained, would have had few terrors; but that the
      opinion should be held by her nearest of kin, to cause them pain for life,
      was a grievous thing. The more she thought of it, the less easy seemed the
      justification of her desire for obscurity. From regarding it as a high
      instinct she passed into a humour that gave that desire the appearance of
      a whim. But could she really set in train events, which, if not abortive,
      would take her to the altar with Viscount Mountclere?
    </p>
    <p>
      In one determination she never faltered; to commit her sin thoroughly if
      she committed it at all. Her relatives believed her choice to lie between
      Neigh and Ladywell alone. But once having decided to pass over
      Christopher, whom she had loved, there could be no pausing for Ladywell
      because she liked him, or for Neigh in that she was influenced by him.
      They were both too near her level to be trusted to bear the shock of
      receiving her from her father's hands. But it was possible that though her
      genesis might tinge with vulgarity a commoner's household, susceptible of
      such depreciation, it might show as a picturesque contrast in the family
      circle of a peer. Hence it was just as well to go to the end of her logic,
      where reasons for tergiversation would be most pronounced. This thought of
      the viscount, however, was a secret for her own breast alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearly the whole of that night she sat weighing-first, the question itself
      of marrying Lord Mountclere; and, at other times, whether, for safety, she
      might marry him without previously revealing family particulars hitherto
      held necessary to be revealed-a piece of conduct she had once felt to be
      indefensible. The ingenious Ethelberta, much more prone than the majority
      of women to theorize on conduct, felt the need of some soothing defence of
      the actions involved in any ambiguous course before finally committing
      herself to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took down a well-known treatise on Utilitarianism which she had
      perused once before, and to which she had given her adherence ere any
      instance had arisen wherein she might wish to take it as a guide. Here she
      desultorily searched for argument, and found it; but the application of
      her author's philosophy to the marriage question was an operation of her
      own, as unjustifiable as it was likely in the circumstances.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    'The ultimate end,' she read, 'with reference to and for the sake of which all other things are desirable (whether we are considering our own good or that of other people) is an existence exempt as far as possible from pain, and as rich as possible in enjoyments, both in point of quantity and quality. . . .  This being, according to the utilitarian opinion, the end of human action, is necessarily also the standard of morality.'
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
It was an open question, so far, whether her own happiness should
or should not be preferred to that of others. But that her personal
interests were not to be considered as paramount appeared further on:-

    'The happiness which forms the standard of what is right in conduct is not the agent's own happiness but that of all concerned.  As between his own happiness and that of others, utilitarianism requires him to be as strictly impartial as a disinterested and benevolent spectator.'
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
As to whose happiness was meant by that of 'other people,' 'all
concerned,' and so on, her luminous moralist soon enlightened her:-

    'The occasions on which any person (except one in a thousand) has it in his power to do this on an extended scale-in other words, to be a public benefactor-are but exceptional; and on these occasions alone is he called on to consider public utility; in every other case private utility, the interest or happiness of some few persons, is all he has to attend to.'
</pre>
    <p>
      And that these few persons should be those endeared to her by every
      domestic tie no argument was needed to prove. That their happiness would
      be in proportion to her own well-doing, and power to remove their risks of
      indigence, required no proving either to her now.
    </p>
    <p>
      By a sorry but unconscious misapplication of sound and wide reasoning did
      the active mind of Ethelberta thus find itself a solace. At about the
      midnight hour she felt more fortified on the expediency of marriage with
      Lord Mountclere than she had done at all since musing on it. In respect of
      the second query, whether or not, in that event, to conceal from Lord
      Mountclere the circumstances of her position till it should be too late
      for him to object to them, she found her conscience inconveniently in the
      way of her theory, and the oracle before her afforded no hint. 'Ah-it is a
      point for a casuist!' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      An old treatise on Casuistry lay on the top shelf. She opened it-more from
      curiosity than from guidance this time, it must be observed-at a chapter
      bearing on her own problem, 'The disciplina arcani, or, the doctrine of
      reserve.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Here she read that there were plenty of apparent instances of this in
      Scripture, and that it was formed into a recognized system in the early
      Church. With reference to direct acts of deception, it was argued that
      since there were confessedly cases where killing is no murder, might there
      not be cases where lying is no sin? It could not be right-or, indeed,
      anything but most absurd-to say in effect that no doubt circumstances
      would occur where every sound man would tell a lie, and would be a brute
      or a fool if he did not, and to say at the same time that it is quite
      indefensible in principle. Duty was the key to conduct then, and if in
      such cases duties appeared to clash they would be found not to do so on
      examination. The lesser duty would yield to the greater, and therefore
      ceased to be a duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      This author she found to be not so tolerable; he distracted her. She put
      him aside and gave over reading, having decided on this second point, that
      she would, at any hazard, represent the truth to Lord Mountclere before
      listening to another word from him. 'Well, at last I have done,' she said,
      'and am ready for my role.'
    </p>
    <p>
      In looking back upon her past as she retired to rest, Ethelberta could
      almost doubt herself to be the identical woman with her who had entered on
      a romantic career a few short years ago. For that doubt she had good
      reason. She had begun as a poet of the Satanic school in a sweetened form;
      she was ending as a pseudo-utilitarian. Was there ever such a
      transmutation effected before by the action of a hard environment? It was
      not without a qualm of regret that she discerned how the last infirmity of
      a noble mind had at length nearly departed from her. She wondered if her
      early notes had had the genuine ring in them, or whether a poet who could
      be thrust by realities to a distance beyond recognition as such was a true
      poet at all. Yet Ethelberta's gradient had been regular: emotional poetry,
      light verse, romance as an object, romance as a means, thoughts of
      marriage as an aid to her pursuits, a vow to marry for the good of her
      family; in other words, from soft and playful Romanticism to distorted
      Benthamism. Was the moral incline upward or down?

    <h2>
      37. KNOLLSEA-AN ORNAMENTAL VILLA
    </h2>
    <p>
      Her energies collected and fermented anew by the results of the vigil,
      Ethelberta left town for Knollsea, where she joined Picotee the same
      evening. Picotee produced a letter, which had been addressed to her sister
      at their London residence, but was not received by her there, Mrs.
      Chickerel having forwarded it to Knollsea the day before Ethelberta
      arrived in town.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crinkled writing, in character like the coast-line of Tierra del
      Fuego, was becoming familiar by this time. While reading the note she
      informed Picotee, between a quick breath and a rustle of frills, that it
      was from Lord Mountclere, who wrote on the subject of calling to see her,
      suggesting a day in the following week. 'Now, Picotee,' she continued, 'we
      shall have to receive him, and make the most of him, for I have altered my
      plans since I was last in Knollsea.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Altered them again? What are you going to be now-not a poor person after
      all?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Indeed not. And so I turn and turn. Can you imagine what Lord Mountclere
      is coming for? But don't say what you think. Before I reply to this letter
      we must go into new lodgings, to give them as our address. The first
      business to-morrow morning will be to look for the gayest house we can
      find; and Captain Flower and this little cabin of his must be things we
      have never known.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day after breakfast they accordingly sallied forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Knollsea had recently begun to attract notice in the world. It had this
      year undergone visitation from a score of professional gentlemen and their
      wives, a minor canon, three marine painters, seven young ladies with books
      in their hands, and nine-and-thirty babies. Hence a few lodging-houses, of
      a dash and pretentiousness far beyond the mark of the old cottages which
      formed the original substance of the village, had been erected to meet the
      wants of such as these. To a building of this class Ethelberta now bent
      her steps, and the crush of the season having departed in the persons of
      three-quarters of the above-named visitors, who went away by a coach, a
      van, and a couple of wagonettes one morning, she found no difficulty in
      arranging for a red and yellow streaked villa, which was so bright and
      glowing that the sun seemed to be shining upon it even on a cloudy day,
      and the ruddiest native looked pale when standing by its walls. It was not
      without regret that she renounced the sailor's pretty cottage for this
      porticoed and balconied dwelling; but her lines were laid down clearly at
      last, and thither she removed forthwith.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this brand-new house did Ethelberta pen the letter fixing the time at
      which she would be pleased to see Lord Mountclere.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the hour drew nigh enormous force of will was required to keep her
      perturbation down. She had not distinctly told Picotee of the object of
      the viscount's visit, but Picotee guessed nearly enough. Ethelberta was
      upon the whole better pleased that the initiative had again come from him
      than if the first step in the new campaign had been her sending the
      explanatory letter, as intended and promised. She had thought almost
      directly after the interview at Rouen that to enlighten him by writing a
      confession in cold blood, according to her first intention, would be
      little less awkward for her in the method of telling than in the facts to
      be told.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the last hair was arranged and the last fold adjusted, and she sat down
      to await a new page of her history. Picotee sat with her, under orders to
      go into the next room when Lord Mountclere should call; and Ethelberta
      determined to waste no time, directly he began to make advances, in
      clearing up the phenomena of her existence to him; to the end that no fact
      which, in the event of his taking her to wife, could be used against her
      as an example of concealment, might remain unrelated. The collapse of his
      attachment under the test might, however, form the grand climax of such a
      play as this.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day was rather cold for the season, and Ethelberta sat by a fire; but
      the windows were open, and Picotee was amusing herself on the balcony
      outside. The hour struck: Ethelberta fancied she could hear the wheels of
      a carriage creeping up the steep ascent which led to the drive before the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is it he?' she said quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No,' said Picotee, whose indifference contrasted strangely with the
      restlessness of her who was usually the coolest. 'It is a man shaking down
      apples in the garden over the wall.'
    </p>
    <p>
      They lingered on till some three or four minutes had gone by. 'Surely
      that's a carriage?' said Ethelberta, then.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I think it is,' said Picotee outside, stretching her neck forward as far
      as she could. 'No, it is the men on the beach dragging up their boats;
      they expect wind to-night.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How wearisome! Picotee, you may as well come inside; if he means to call
      he will; but he ought to be here by this time.'
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only once more, and that some time later that she again said
      'Listen!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's not the noise of a carriage; it is the fizz of a rocket. The
      coastguardsmen are practising the life-apparatus to-day, to be ready for
      the autumn wrecks.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah!' said Ethelberta, her face clearing up. Hers had not been a
      sweetheart's impatience, but her mood had intensified during these minutes
      of suspense to a harassing mistrust of her man-compelling power, which
      was, if that were possible, more gloomy than disappointed love. 'I know
      now where he is. That operation with the cradle-apparatus is very
      interesting, and he is stopping to see it. . . . But I shall not wait
      indoors much longer, whatever he may be stopping to see. It is very
      unaccountable, and vexing, after moving into this new house too. We were
      much more comfortable in the old one. In keeping any previous appointment
      in which I have been concerned he has been ridiculously early.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Shall I run round?' said Picotee, 'and if he is not watching them we will
      go out.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very well,' said her sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time of Picotee's absence seemed an age. Ethelberta heard the roar of
      another rocket, and still Picotee did not return. 'What can the girl be
      thinking of?' she mused. . . . 'What a half-and-half policy mine has been!
      Thinking of marrying for position, and yet not making it my rigid plan to
      secure the man the first moment that he made his offer. So I lose the
      comfort of having a soul above worldliness, and my compensation for not
      having it likewise!' A minute or two more and in came Picotee.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What has kept you so long-and how excited you look,' said Ethelberta.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I thought I would stay a little while, as I had never seen a
      rocket-apparatus,' said Picotee, faintly and strangely.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But is he there?' asked her sister impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes-he was. He's gone now!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lord Mountclere?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No. There is no old man there at all. Mr Julian was there.'
    </p>
    <p>
      A little 'Ah!' came from Ethelberta, like a note from a storm-bird at
      night. She turned round and went into the back room. 'Is Mr. Julian going
      to call here?' she inquired, coming forward again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No-he's gone by the steamboat. He was only passing through on his way to
      Sandbourne, where he is gone to settle a small business relating to his
      father's affairs. He was not in Knollsea ten minutes, owing to something
      which detained him on the way.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Did he inquire for me?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No. And only think, Ethelberta-such a remarkable thing has happened,
      though I nearly forgot to tell you. He says that coming along the road he
      was overtaken by a carriage, and when it had just passed him one of the
      horses shied, pushed the other down a slope, and overturned the carriage.
      One wheel came off and trundled to the bottom of the hill by itself.
      Christopher of course ran up, and helped out of the carriage an old
      gentleman-now do you know what's likely?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It was Lord Mountclere. I am glad that's the cause,' said Ethelberta
      involuntarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I imagined you would suppose it to be Lord Mountclere. But Mr. Julian did
      not know the gentleman, and said nothing about who he might be.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Did he describe him?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not much-just a little.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He said he was a sly old dog apparently, to hear how he swore in
      whispers. This affair is what made Mr. Julian so late that he had no time
      to call here. Lord Mountclere's ankle-if it was Lord Mountclere-was badly
      sprained. But the servants were not injured beyond a scratch on the
      coachman's face. Then they got another carriage and drove at once back
      again. It must be he, or else why is he not come? It is a pity, too, that
      Mr. Julian was hindered by this, so that there was no opportunity for him
      to bide a bit in Knollsea.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta was not disposed to believe that Christopher would have called,
      had time favoured him to the utmost. Between himself and her there was
      that kind of division which is more insurmountable than enmity; for
      estrangements produced by good judgment will last when those of feeling
      break down in smiles. Not the lovers who part in passion, but the lovers
      who part in friendship, are those who most frequently part for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Did you tell Mr. Julian that the injured gentleman was possibly Lord
      Mountclere, and that he was coming here?' said Ethelberta.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I made no remark at all-I did not think of him till afterwards.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The inquiry was hardly necessary, for Picotee's words would dry away like
      a brook in the sands when she held conversation with Christopher.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they had anticipated, the sufferer was no other than their intending
      visitor. Next morning there was a note explaining the accident, and
      expressing its writer's suffering from the cruel delay as greater than
      that from the swollen ankle, which was progressing favourably.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing further was heard of Lord Mountclere for more than a week, when
      she received another letter, which put an end to her season of relaxation,
      and once more braced her to the contest. This epistle was very courteously
      written, and in point of correctness, propriety, and gravity, might have
      come from the quill of a bishop. Herein the old nobleman gave a further
      description of the accident, but the main business of the communication
      was to ask her if, since he was not as yet very active, she would come to
      Enckworth Court and delight himself and a small group of friends who were
      visiting there.
    </p>
    <p>
      She pondered over the letter as she walked by the shore that day, and
      after some hesitation decided to go.

    <h2>
      38. ENCKWORTH COURT
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was on a dull, stagnant, noiseless afternoon of autumn that Ethelberta
      first crossed the threshold of Enckworth Court. The daylight was so
      lowered by the impervious roof of cloud overhead that it scarcely reached
      further into Lord Mountclere's entrance-hall than to the splays of the
      windows, even but an hour or two after midday; and indoors the glitter of
      the fire reflected itself from the very panes, so inconsiderable were the
      opposing rays.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enckworth Court, in its main part, had not been standing more than a
      hundred years. At that date the weakened portions of the original
      mediaeval structure were pulled down and cleared away, old jambs being
      carried off for rick-staddles, and the foliated timbers of the hall roof
      making themselves useful as fancy chairs in the summer-houses of rising
      inns. A new block of masonry was built up from the ground of such height
      and lordliness that the remnant of the old pile left standing became as a
      mere cup-bearer and culinary menial beside it. The rooms in this old
      fragment, which had in times past been considered sufficiently dignified
      for dining-hall, withdrawing-room, and so on, were now reckoned barely
      high enough for sculleries, servants' hall, and laundries, the whole of
      which were arranged therein.
    </p>
    <p>
      The modern portion had been planned with such a total disregard of
      association, that the very rudeness of the contrast gave an interest to
      the mass which it might have wanted had perfect harmony been attempted
      between the old nucleus and its adjuncts, a probable result if the
      enlargement had taken place later on in time. The issue was that the
      hooded windows, simple string-courses, and random masonry of the Gothic
      workman, stood elbow to elbow with the equal-spaced ashlar, architraves,
      and fasciae of the Classic addition, each telling its distinct tale as to
      stage of thought and domestic habit without any of those artifices of
      blending or restoration by which the seeker for history in stones will be
      utterly hoodwinked in time to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the left of the door and vestibule which Ethelberta passed through rose
      the principal staircase, constructed of a freestone so milk-white and
      delicately moulded as to be easily conceived in the lamplight as of
      biscuit-ware. Who, unacquainted with the secrets of geometrical
      construction, could imagine that, hanging so airily there, to all
      appearance supported on nothing, were twenty or more tons dead weight of
      stone, that would have made a prison for an elephant if so arranged? The
      art which produced this illusion was questionable, but its success was
      undoubted. 'How lovely!' said Ethelberta, as she looked at the fairy
      ascent. 'His staircase alone is worth my hand!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Passing along by the colonnade, which partly fenced the staircase from the
      visitor, the saloon was reached, an apartment forming a double cube. About
      the left-hand end of this were grouped the drawing-rooms and library;
      while on the right was the dining-hall, with billiard, smoking, and gun
      rooms in mysterious remoteness beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without attempting to trace an analogy between a man and his mansion, it
      may be stated that everything here, though so dignified and magnificent,
      was not conceived in quite the true and eternal spirit of art. It was a
      house in which Pugin would have torn his hair. Those massive blocks of
      red-veined marble lining the hall-emulating in their surface-glitter the
      Escalier de Marbre at Versailles-were cunning imitations in paint and
      plaster by workmen brought from afar for the purpose, at a prodigious
      expense, by the present viscount's father, and recently repaired and
      re-varnished. The dark green columns and pilasters corresponding were
      brick at the core. Nay, the external walls, apparently of massive and
      solid freestone, were only veneered with that material, being, like the
      pillars, of brick within.
    </p>
    <p>
      To a stone mask worn by a brick face a story naturally appertained-one
      which has since done service in other quarters. When the vast addition had
      just been completed King George visited Enckworth. Its owner pointed out
      the features of its grand architectural attempt, and waited for
      commendation.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Brick, brick, brick,' said the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Georgian Lord Mountclere blushed faintly, albeit to his very poll, and
      said nothing more about his house that day. When the king was gone he sent
      frantically for the craftsmen recently dismissed, and soon the green lawns
      became again the colour of a Nine-Elms cement wharf. Thin freestone slabs
      were affixed to the whole series of fronts by copper cramps and dowels,
      each one of substance sufficient to have furnished a poor boy's pocket
      with pennies for a month, till not a speck of the original surface
      remained, and the edifice shone in all the grandeur of massive masonry
      that was not massive at all. But who remembered this save the builder and
      his crew? and as long as nobody knew the truth, pretence looked just as
      well.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was honest in Enckworth Court was that portion of the original
      edifice which still remained, now degraded to subservient uses. Where the
      untitled Mountclere of the White Rose faction had spread his knees over
      the brands, when the place was a castle and not a court, the still-room
      maid now simmered her preserves; and where Elizabethan mothers and
      daughters of that sturdy line had tapestried the love-scenes of Isaac and
      Jacob, boots and shoes were now cleaned and coals stowed away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Mountclere had so far recovered from the sprain as to be nominally
      quite well, under pressure of a wish to receive guests. The sprain had in
      one sense served him excellently. He had now a reason, apart from that of
      years, for walking with his stick, and took care to let the reason be
      frequently known. To-day he entertained a larger number of persons than
      had been assembled within his walls for a great length of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Until after dinner Ethelberta felt as if she were staying at an hotel. Few
      of the people whom she had met at the meeting of the Imperial Association
      greeted her here. The viscount's brother was not present, but Sir Cyril
      Blandsbury and his wife were there, a lively pair of persons, entertaining
      as actors, and friendly as dogs. Beyond these all the faces and figures
      were new to her, though they were handsome and dashing enough to satisfy a
      court chronicler. Ethelberta, in a dress sloped about as high over the
      shoulder as would have drawn approval from Reynolds, and expostulation
      from Lely, thawed and thawed each friend who came near her, and sent him
      or her away smiling; yet she felt a little surprise. She had seldom
      visited at a country-house, and knew little of the ordinary composition of
      a group of visitors within its walls; but the present assemblage seemed to
      want much of that old-fashioned stability and quaint monumental dignity
      she had expected to find under this historical roof. Nobody of her
      entertainer's own rank appeared. Not a single clergyman was there. A
      tendency to talk Walpolean scandal about foreign courts was particularly
      manifest. And although tropical travellers, Indian officers and their
      wives, courteous exiles, and descendants of Irish kings, were infinitely
      more pleasant than Lord Mountclere's landed neighbours would probably have
      been, to such a cosmopolite as Ethelberta a calm Tory or old Whig company
      would have given a greater treat. They would have struck as gratefully
      upon her senses as sylvan scenery after crags and cliffs, or silence after
      the roar of a cataract.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was evening, and all these personages at Enckworth Court were merry,
      snug, and warm within its walls. Dinner-time had passed, and everything
      had gone on well, when Mrs. Tara O'Fanagan, who had a gold-clamped tooth,
      which shone every now and then, asked Ethelberta if she would amuse them
      by telling a story, since nobody present, except Lord Mountclere, had ever
      heard one from her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing that Ethelberta had been working at that art as a profession, it
      can hardly be said that the question was conceived with tact, though it
      was put with grace. Lord Mountclere evidently thought it objectionable,
      for he looked unhappy. To only one person in the brilliant room did the
      request appear as a timely accident, and that was to Ethelberta herself.
      Her honesty was always making war upon her manoeuvres, and shattering
      their delicate meshes, to her great inconvenience and delay. Thus there
      arose those devious impulses and tangential flights which spoil the works
      of every would-be schemer who instead of being wholly machine is half
      heart. One of these now was to show herself as she really was, not only to
      Lord Mountclere, but to his friends assembled, whom, in her ignorance, she
      respected more than they deserved, and so get rid of that self-reproach
      which had by this time reached a morbid pitch, through her
      over-sensitiveness to a situation in which a large majority of women and
      men would have seen no falseness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Full of this curious intention, she quietly assented to the request, and
      laughingly bade them put themselves in listening order.
    </p>
    <p>
      'An old story will suit us,' said the lady who had importuned her. 'We
      have never heard one.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No; it shall be quite new,' she replied. 'One not yet made public; though
      it soon will be.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The narrative began by introducing to their notice a girl of the poorest
      and meanest parentage, the daughter of a serving-man, and the fifth of ten
      children. She graphically recounted, as if they were her own, the strange
      dreams and ambitious longings of this child when young, her attempts to
      acquire education, partial failures, partial successes, and constant
      struggles; instancing how, on one of these occasions, the girl concealed
      herself under a bookcase of the library belonging to the mansion in which
      her father served as footman, and having taken with her there, like a
      young Fawkes, matches and a halfpenny candle, was going to sit up all
      night reading when the family had retired, until her father discovered and
      prevented her scheme. Then followed her experiences as nursery-governess,
      her evening lessons under self-selected masters, and her ultimate rise to
      a higher grade among the teaching sisterhood. Next came another epoch. To
      the mansion in which she was engaged returned a truant son, between whom
      and the heroine an attachment sprang up. The master of the house was an
      ambitious gentleman just knighted, who, perceiving the state of their
      hearts, harshly dismissed the homeless governess, and rated the son, the
      consequence being that the youthful pair resolved to marry secretly, and
      carried their resolution into effect. The runaway journey came next, and
      then a moving description of the death of the young husband, and the
      terror of the bride.
    </p>
    <p>
      The guests began to look perplexed, and one or two exchanged whispers.
      This was not at all the kind of story that they had expected; it was quite
      different from her usual utterances, the nature of which they knew by
      report. Ethelberta kept her eye upon Lord Mountclere. Soon, to her
      amazement, there was that in his face which told her that he knew the
      story and its heroine quite well. When she delivered the sentence ending
      with the professedly fictitious words: 'I thus was reduced to great
      distress, and vainly cast about me for directions what to do,' Lord
      Mountclere's manner became so excited and anxious that it acted
      reciprocally upon Ethelberta; her voice trembled, she moved her lips but
      uttered nothing. To bring the story up to the date of that very evening
      had been her intent, but it was beyond her power. The spell was broken;
      she blushed with distress and turned away, for the folly of a disclosure
      here was but too apparent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though every one saw that she had broken down, none of them appeared to
      know the reason why, or to have the clue to her performance. Fortunately
      Lord Mountclere came to her aid.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Let the first part end here,' he said, rising and approaching her. 'We
      have been well entertained so far. I could scarcely believe that the story
      I was listening to was utterly an invention, so vividly does Mrs.
      Petherwin bring the scenes before our eyes. She must now be exhausted; we
      will have the remainder to-morrow.'
    </p>
    <p>
      They all agreed that this was well, and soon after fell into groups, and
      dispersed about the rooms. When everybody's attention was thus occupied
      Lord Mountclere whispered to Ethelberta tremulously, 'Don't tell more: you
      think too much of them: they are no better than you! Will you meet me in
      the little winter garden two minutes hence? Pass through that door, and
      along the glass passage.' He himself left the room by an opposite door.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had not set three steps in the warm snug octagon of glass and plants
      when he appeared on the other side.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You knew it all before!' she said, looking keenly at him. 'Who told you,
      and how long have you known it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Before yesterday or last week,' said Lord Mountclere. 'Even before we met
      in France. Why are you so surprised?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta had been surprised, and very greatly, to find him, as it were,
      secreted in the very rear of her position. That nothing she could tell was
      new to him was a good deal to think of, but it was little beside the
      recollection that he had actually made his first declaration in the face
      of that knowledge of her which she had supposed so fatal to all her
      matrimonial ambitions.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And now only one point remains to be settled,' he said, taking her hand.
      'You promised at Rouen that at our next interview you would honour me with
      a decisive reply-one to make me happy for ever.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But my father and friends?' said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Are nothing to be concerned about. Modern developments have shaken up the
      classes like peas in a hopper. An annuity, and a comfortable cottage-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'My brothers are workmen.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Manufacture is the single vocation in which a man's prospects may be said
      to be illimitable. Hee-hee!-they may buy me up before they die! And now
      what stands in the way? It would take fifty alliances with fifty families
      so little disreputable as yours, darling, to drag mine down.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta had anticipated the scene, and settled her course; what had to
      be said and done here was mere formality; yet she had been unable to go
      straight to the assent required. However, after these words of
      self-depreciation, which were let fall as much for her own future ease of
      conscience as for his present warning, she made no more ado.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I shall think it a great honour to be your wife,' she said simply.

    <h2>
      39. KNOLLSEA-MELCHESTER
    </h2>
    <p>
      The year was now moving on apace, but Ethelberta and Picotee chose to
      remain at Knollsea, in the brilliant variegated brick and stone villa to
      which they had removed in order to be in keeping with their ascending
      fortunes. Autumn had begun to make itself felt and seen in bolder and less
      subtle ways than at first. In the morning now, on coming downstairs, in
      place of a yellowish-green leaf or two lying in a corner of the lowest
      step, which had been the only previous symptoms around the house, she saw
      dozens of them playing at corkscrews in the wind, directly the door was
      opened. Beyond, towards the sea, the slopes and scarps that had been
      muffled with a thick robe of cliff herbage, were showing their chill grey
      substance through the withered verdure, like the background of velvet
      whence the pile has been fretted away. Unexpected breezes broomed and
      rasped the smooth bay in evanescent patches of stippled shade, and,
      besides the small boats, the ponderous lighters used in shipping stone
      were hauled up the beach in anticipation of the equinoctial attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days after Ethelberta's reception at Enckworth, an improved
      stanhope, driven by Lord Mountclere himself, climbed up the hill until it
      was opposite her door. A few notes from a piano softly played reached his
      ear as he descended from his place: on being shown in to his betrothed, he
      could perceive that she had just left the instrument. Moreover, a tear was
      visible in her eye when she came near him.
    </p>
    <p>
      They discoursed for several minutes in the manner natural between a
      defenceless young widow and an old widower in Lord Mountclere's position
      to whom she was plighted-a great deal of formal considerateness making
      itself visible on her part, and of extreme tenderness on his. While thus
      occupied, he turned to the piano, and casually glanced at a piece of music
      lying open upon it. Some words of writing at the top expressed that it was
      the composer's original copy, presented by him, Christopher Julian, to the
      author of the song. Seeing that he noticed the sheet somewhat lengthily,
      Ethelberta remarked that it had been an offering made to her a long time
      ago-a melody written to one of her own poems.
    </p>
    <p>
      'In the writing of the composer,' observed Lord Mountclere, with interest.
      'An offering from the musician himself-very gratifying and touching. Mr.
      Christopher Julian is the name I see upon it, I believe? I knew his
      father, Dr. Julian, a Sandbourne man, if I recollect.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' said Ethelberta placidly. But it was really with an effort. The
      song was the identical one which Christopher sent up to her from
      Sandbourne when the fire of her hope burnt high for less material ends;
      and the discovery of the sheet among her music that day had started eddies
      of emotion for some time checked.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am sorry you have been grieved,' said Lord Mountclere, with gloomy
      restlessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Grieved?' said Ethelberta.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Did I not see a tear there? or did my eyes deceive me?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You might have seen one.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah! a tear, and a song. I think-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You naturally think that a woman who cries over a man's gift must be in
      love with the giver?' Ethelberta looked him serenely in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Mountclere's jealous suspicions were considerably shaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not at all,' he said hastily, as if ashamed. 'One who cries over a song
      is much affected by its sentiment.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you expect authors to cry over their own words?' she inquired, merging
      defence in attack. 'I am afraid they don't often do that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You would make me uneasy.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'On the contrary, I would reassure you. Are you not still doubting?' she
      asked, with a pleasant smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I cannot doubt you!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Swear, like a faithful knight.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I swear, my fairy, my flower!'
    </p>
    <p>
      After this the old man appeared to be pondering; indeed, his thoughts
      could hardly be said to be present when he uttered the words. For though
      the tabernacle was getting shaky by reason of years and merry living, so
      that what was going on inside might often be guessed without by the
      movement of the hangings, as in a puppet-show with worn canvas, he could
      be quiet enough when scheming any plot of particular neatness, which had
      less emotion than impishness in it. Such an innocent amusement he was
      pondering now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before leaving her, he asked if she would accompany him to a morning
      instrumental concert at Melchester, which was to take place in the course
      of that week for the benefit of some local institution.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Melchester,' she repeated faintly, and observed him as searchingly as it
      was possible to do without exposing herself to a raking fire in return.
      Could he know that Christopher was living there, and was this said in
      prolongation of his recent suspicion? But Lord Mountclere's face gave no
      sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You forget one fatal objection,' said she; 'the secrecy in which it is
      imperative that the engagement between us should be kept.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am not known in Melchester without my carriage; nor are you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'We may be known by somebody on the road.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then let it be arranged in this way. I will not call here to take you up,
      but will meet you at the station at Anglebury; and we can go on together
      by train without notice. Surely there can be no objection to that? It
      would be mere prudishness to object, since we are to become one so
      shortly.' He spoke a little impatiently. It was plain that he particularly
      wanted her to go to Melchester.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I merely meant that there was a chance of discovery in our going out
      together. And discovery means no marriage.' She was pale now, and sick at
      heart, for it seemed that the viscount must be aware that Christopher
      dwelt at that place, and was about to test her concerning him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why does it mean no marriage?' said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My father might, and almost certainly would, object to it. Although he
      cannot control me, he might entreat me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why would he object?' said Lord Mountclere uneasily, and somewhat
      haughtily.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't know.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But you will be my wife-say again that you will.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He breathed. 'He will not object-hee-hee!' he said. 'O no-I think you will
      be mine now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have said so. But look to me all the same.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You malign yourself, dear one. But you will meet me at Anglebury, as I
      wish, and go on to Melchester with me?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I shall be pleased to-if my sister may accompany me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah-your sister. Yes, of course.'
    </p>
    <p>
      They settled the time of the journey, and when the visit had been
      stretched out as long as it reasonably could be with propriety, Lord
      Mountclere took his leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was again seated on the driving-phaeton which he had brought that
      day, Lord Mountclere looked gleeful, and shrewd enough in his own opinion
      to outwit Mephistopheles. As soon as they were ascending a hill, and he
      could find time to free his hand, he pulled off his glove, and drawing
      from his pocket a programme of the Melchester concert referred to,
      contemplated therein the name of one of the intended performers. The name
      was that of Mr. C. Julian. Replacing it again, he looked ahead, and some
      time after murmured with wily mirth, 'An excellent test-a lucky thought!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing of importance occurred during the intervening days. At two o'clock
      on the appointed afternoon Ethelberta stepped from the train at Melchester
      with the viscount, who had met her as proposed; she was followed behind by
      Picotee.
    </p>
    <p>
      The concert was to be held at the Town-hall half-an-hour later. They
      entered a fly in waiting, and secure from recognition, were driven
      leisurely in that direction, Picotee silent and absorbed with her own
      thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      'There's the Cathedral,' said Lord Mountclere humorously, as they caught a
      view of one of its towers through a street leading into the Close.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It boasts of a very fine organ.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And the organist is a clever young man.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Mountclere paused a moment or two. 'By the way, you may remember that
      he is the Mr. Julian who set your song to music!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I recollect it quite well.' Her heart was horrified and she thought Lord
      Mountclere must be developing into an inquisitor, which perhaps he was.
      But none of this reached her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      They turned in the direction of the Hall, were set down, and entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The large assembly-room set apart for the concert was upstairs, and it was
      possible to enter it in two ways: by the large doorway in front of the
      landing, or by turning down a side passage leading to council-rooms and
      subsidiary apartments of small size, which were allotted to performers in
      any exhibition; thus they could enter from one of these directly upon the
      platform, without passing through the audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Will you seat yourselves here?' said Lord Mountclere, who, instead of
      entering by the direct door, had brought the young women round into this
      green-room, as it may be called. 'You see we have come in privately
      enough; when the musicians arrive we can pass through behind them, and
      step down to our seats from the front.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The players could soon be heard tuning in the next room. Then one came
      through the passage-room where the three waited, and went in, then
      another, then another. Last of all came Julian.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta sat facing the door, but Christopher, never in the least
      expecting her there, did not recognize her till he was quite inside. When
      he had really perceived her to be the one who had troubled his soul so
      many times and long, the blood in his face-never very much-passed off and
      left it, like the shade of a cloud. Between them stood a table covered
      with green baize, which, reflecting upwards a band of sunlight shining
      across the chamber, flung upon his already white features the virescent
      hues of death. The poor musician, whose person, much to his own
      inconvenience, constituted a complete breviary of the gentle emotions,
      looked as if he were going to fall down in a faint.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta flung at Lord Mountclere a look which clipped him like pincers:
      he never forgot it as long as he lived.
    </p>
    <p>
      'This is your pretty jealous scheme-I see it!' she hissed to him, and
      without being able to control herself went across to Julian.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a slight gasp came from behind the door where Picotee had been
      sitting. Ethelberta and Lord Mountclere looked that way: and behold,
      Picotee had nearly swooned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta's show of passion went as quickly as it had come, for she felt
      that a splendid triumph had been put into her hands. 'Now do you see the
      truth?' she whispered to Lord Mountclere without a drachm of feeling;
      pointing to Christopher and then to Picotee-as like as two snowdrops now.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I do, I do,' murmured the viscount hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      They both went forward to help Christopher in restoring the fragile
      Picotee: he had set himself to that task as suddenly as he possibly could
      to cover his own near approach to the same condition. Not much help was
      required, the little girl's indisposition being quite momentary, and she
      sat up in the chair again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Are you better?' said Ethelberta to Christopher.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Quite well-quite,' he said, smiling faintly. 'I am glad to see you. I
      must, I think, go into the next room now.' He bowed and walked out
      awkwardly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Are you better, too?' she said to Picotee.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Quite well,' said Picotee.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are quite sure you know between whom the love lies now-eh?'
      Ethelberta asked in a sarcastic whisper of Lord Mountclere.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am-beyond a doubt,' murmured the anxious nobleman; he feared that look
      of hers, which was not less dominant than irresistible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some additional moments given to thought on the circumstances rendered
      Ethelberta still more indignant and intractable. She went out at the door
      by which they had entered, along the passage, and down the stairs. A
      shuffling footstep followed, but she did not turn her head. When they
      reached the bottom of the stairs the carriage had gone, their exit not
      being expected till two hours later. Ethelberta, nothing daunted, swept
      along the pavement and down the street in a turbulent prance, Lord
      Mountclere trotting behind with a jowl reduced to a mere nothing by his
      concern at the discourtesy into which he had been lured by jealous
      whisperings.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My dearest-forgive me; I confess I doubted you-but I was beside myself,'
      came to her ears from over her shoulder. But Ethelberta walked on as
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Mountclere sighed like a poet over a ledger. 'An old man-who is not
      very old-naturally torments himself with fears of losing-no, no-it was an
      innocent jest of mine-you will forgive a joke-hee-hee?' he said again, on
      getting no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You had no right to mistrust me!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I do not-you did not blench. You should have told me before that it was
      your sister and not yourself who was entangled with him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You brought me to Melchester on purpose to confront him!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, I did.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Are you not ashamed?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am satisfied. It is better to know the truth by any means than to die
      of suspense; better for us both-surely you see that?'
    </p>
    <p>
      They had by this time got to the end of a long street, and into a deserted
      side road by which the station could be indirectly reached. Picotee
      appeared in the distance as a mere distracted speck of girlhood, following
      them because not knowing what else to do in her sickness of body and mind.
      Once out of sight here, Ethelberta began to cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ethelberta,' said Lord Mountclere, in an agony of trouble, 'don't be
      vexed! It was an inconsiderate trick-I own it. Do what you will, but do
      not desert me now! I could not bear it-you would kill me if you were to
      leave me. Anything, but be mine.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta continued her way, and drying her eyes entered the station,
      where, on searching the time-tables, she found there would be no train for
      Anglebury for the next two hours. Then more slowly she turned towards the
      town again, meeting Picotee and keeping in her company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Mountclere gave up the chase, but as he wished to get into the town
      again, he followed in the same direction. When Ethelberta had proceeded as
      far as the Red Lion Hotel, she turned towards it with her companion, and
      being shown to a room, the two sisters shut themselves in. Lord Mountclere
      paused and entered the White Hart, the rival hotel to the Red Lion, which
      stood in an adjoining street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having secluded himself in an apartment here, walked from window to window
      awhile, and made himself generally uncomfortable, he sat down to the
      writing materials on the table, and concocted a note:-
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    'WHITE HART HOTEL.

    'MY DEAR MRS. PETHERWIN,-You do not mean to be so cruel as to break your plighted word to me?  Remember, there is no love without much jealousy, and lovers are ever full of sighs and misgiving.  I have owned to as much contrition as can reasonably be expected.  I could not endure the suspicion that you loved another.-Yours always,

    'MOUNTCLERE.'
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
This he sent, watching from the window its progress along the street. He
awaited anxiously for an answer, and waited long. It was nearly twenty
minutes before he could hear a messenger approaching the door. Yes-she
had actually sent a reply; he prized it as if it had been the first
encouragement he had ever in his life received from woman:-

    'MY LORD' (wrote Ethelberta),-'I am not prepared at present to enter into the question of marriage at all. The incident which has occurred affords me every excuse for withdrawing my promise, since it was given under misapprehensions on a point that materially affects my happiness.

    'E. PETHERWIN.'
</pre>
    <p>
      'Ho-ho-ho-Miss Hoity-toity!' said Lord Mountclere, trotting up and down.
      But, remembering it was her June against his November, this did not last
      long, and he frantically replied:-
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    'MY DARLING,-I cannot release you-I must do anything to keep my treasure.  Will you not see me for a few minutes, and let bygones go to the winds?'
</pre>
    <p>
      Was ever a thrush so safe in a cherry net before!
    </p>
    <p>
      The messenger came back with the information that Mrs. Petherwin had taken
      a walk to the Close, her companion alone remaining at the hotel. There
      being nothing else left for the viscount to do, he put on his hat, and
      went out on foot in the same direction. He had not walked far when he saw
      Ethelberta moving slowly along the High Street before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta was at this hour wandering without any fixed intention beyond
      that of consuming time. She was very wretched, and very indifferent: the
      former when thinking of her past, the latter when thinking of the days to
      come. While she walked thus unconscious of the streets, and their groups
      of other wayfarers, she saw Christopher emerge from a door not many paces
      in advance, and close it behind him: he stood for a moment on the step
      before descending into the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not, even had she wished it, easily check her progress without
      rendering the chance of his perceiving her still more certain. But she did
      not wish any such thing, and it made little difference, for he had already
      seen her in taking his survey round, and came down from the door to her
      side. It was impossible for anything formal to pass between them now.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are not at the concert, Mr. Julian?' she said. 'I am glad to have a
      better opportunity of speaking to you, and of asking for your sister.
      Unfortunately there is not time for us to call upon her to-day.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Thank you, but it makes no difference,' said Julian, with somewhat sad
      reserve. 'I will tell her I have met you; she is away from home just at
      present.' And finding that Ethelberta did not rejoin immediately he
      observed, 'The chief organist, old Dr. Breeve, has taken my place at the
      concert, as it was arranged he should do after the opening part. I am now
      going to the Cathedral for the afternoon service. You are going there
      too?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I thought of looking at the interior for a moment.'
    </p>
    <p>
      So they went on side by side, saying little; for it was a situation in
      which scarcely any appropriate thing could be spoken. Ethelberta was the
      less reluctant to walk in his company because of the provocation to
      skittishness that Lord Mountclere had given, a provocation which she still
      resented. But she was far from wishing to increase his jealousy; and yet
      this was what she was doing, Lord Mountclere being a perturbed witness
      from behind of all that was passing now.
    </p>
    <p>
      They turned the corner of the short street of connection which led under
      an archway to the Cathedral Close, the old peer dogging them still.
      Christopher seemed to warm up a little, and repeated the invitation. 'You
      will come with your sister to see us before you leave?' he said. 'We have
      tea at six.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'We shall have left Melchester before that time. I am now only waiting for
      the train.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You two have not come all the way from Knollsea alone?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Part of the way,' said Ethelberta evasively.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And going back alone?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No. Only for the last five miles. At least that was the arrangement-I am
      not quite sure if it holds good.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You don't wish me to see you safely in the train?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is not necessary: thank you very much. We are well used to getting
      about the world alone, and from Melchester to Knollsea is no serious
      journey, late or early. . . . Yet I think I ought, in honesty, to tell you
      that we are not entirely by ourselves in Melchester to-day.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I remember I saw your friend-relative-in the room at the Town-hall. It
      did not occur to my mind for the moment that he was any other than a
      stranger standing there.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He is not a relative,' she said, with perplexity. 'I hardly know,
      Christopher, how to explain to you my position here to-day, because of
      some difficulties that have arisen since we have been in the town, which
      may alter it entirely. On that account I will be less frank with you than
      I should like to be, considering how long we have known each other. It
      would be wrong, however, if I were not to tell you that there has been a
      possibility of my marriage with him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The elderly gentleman?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. And I came here in his company, intending to return with him. But
      you shall know all soon. Picotee shall write to Faith.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I always think the Cathedral looks better from this point than from the
      point usually chosen by artists,' he said, with nervous quickness,
      directing her glance upwards to the silent structure, now misty and
      unrelieved by either high light or deep shade. 'We get the grouping of the
      chapels and choir-aisles more clearly shown-and the whole culminates to a
      more perfect pyramid from this spot-do you think so?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. I do.'
    </p>
    <p>
      A little further, and Christopher stopped to enter, when Ethelberta bade
      him farewell. 'I thought at one time that our futures might have been
      different from what they are apparently becoming,' he said then, regarding
      her as a stall-reader regards the brilliant book he cannot afford to buy.
      'But one gets weary of repining about that. I wish Picotee and yourself
      could see us oftener; I am as confirmed a bachelor now as Faith is an old
      maid. I wonder if-should the event you contemplate occur-you and he will
      ever visit us, or we shall ever visit you!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher was evidently imagining the elderly gentleman to be some
      retired farmer, or professional man already so intermixed with the
      metamorphic classes of society as not to be surprised or inconvenienced by
      her beginnings; one who wished to secure Ethelberta as an ornament to his
      parlour fire in a quiet spirit, and in no intoxicated mood regardless of
      issues. She could scarcely reply to his supposition; and the parting was
      what might have been predicted from a conversation so carefully
      controlled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta, as she had intended, now went on further, and entering the
      nave began to inspect the sallow monuments which lined the grizzled pile.
      She did not perceive amid the shadows an old gentleman who had crept into
      the mouldy place as stealthily as a worm into a skull, and was keeping
      himself carefully beyond her observation. She continued to regard feature
      after feature till the choristers had filed in from the south side, and
      peals broke forth from the organ on the black oaken mass at the junction
      of nave and choir, shaking every cobweb in the dusky vaults, and
      Ethelberta's heart no less. She knew the fingers that were pressing out
      those rolling sounds, and knowing them, became absorbed in tracing their
      progress. To go towards the organ-loft was an act of unconsciousness, and
      she did not pause till she stood almost beneath it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta was awakened from vague imaginings by the close approach of the
      old gentleman alluded to, who spoke with a great deal of agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have been trying to meet with you,' said Lord Mountclere. 'Come, let us
      be friends again!-Ethelberta, I MUST not lose you! You cannot mean that
      the engagement shall be broken off?' He was far too desirous to possess
      her at any price now to run a second risk of exasperating her, and forbore
      to make any allusion to the recent pantomime between herself and
      Christopher that he had beheld, though it might reasonably have filled him
      with dread and petulance.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I do not mean anything beyond this,' said she, 'that I entirely withdraw
      from it on the faintest sign that you have not abandoned such miserable
      jealous proceedings as those you adopted to-day.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have quite abandoned them. Will you come a little further this way, and
      walk in the aisle? You do still agree to be mine?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If it gives you any pleasure, I do.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, yes. I implore that the marriage may be soon-very soon.' The
      viscount spoke hastily, for the notes of the organ which were plunging
      into their ears ever and anon from the hands of his young rival seemed
      inconveniently and solemnly in the way of his suit.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, Lord Mountclere?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Say in a few days?-it is the only thing that will satisfy me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am absolutely indifferent as to the day. If it pleases you to have it
      early I am willing.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dare I ask that it may be this week?' said the delighted old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I could not say that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But you can name the earliest day?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I cannot now. We had better be going from here, I think.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cathedral was filling with shadows, and cold breathings came round the
      piers, for it was November, when night very soon succeeds noon in spots
      where noon is sobered to the pallor of eve. But the service was not yet
      over, and before quite leaving the building Ethelberta cast one other
      glance towards the organ and thought of him behind it. At this moment her
      attention was arrested by the form of her sister Picotee, who came in at
      the north door, closed the lobby-wicket softly, and went lightly forward
      to the choir. When within a few yards of it she paused by a pillar, and
      lingered there looking up at the organ as Ethelberta had done. No sound
      was coming from the ponderous mass of tubes just then; but in a short
      space a whole crowd of tones spread from the instrument to accompany the
      words of a response. Picotee started at the burst of music as if taken in
      a dishonest action, and moved on in a manner intended to efface the
      lover's loiter of the preceding moments from her own consciousness no less
      than from other people's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you see that?' said Ethelberta. 'That little figure is my dearest
      sister. Could you but ensure a marriage between her and him she listens
      to, I would do anything you wish!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That is indeed a gracious promise,' said Lord Mountclere. 'And would you
      agree to what I asked just now?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'When?' A gleeful spark accompanied this.
    </p>
    <p>
      'As you requested.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'This week? The day after to-morrow?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If you will. But remember what lies on your side of the contract. I fancy
      I have given you a task beyond your powers.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, darling, we are at one at last,' said Lord Mountclere, rubbing his
      hand against his side. 'And if my task is heavy and I cannot guarantee the
      result, I can make it very probable. Marry me on Friday-the day after
      to-morrow-and I will do all that money and influence can effect to bring
      about their union.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You solemnly promise? You will never cease to give me all the aid in your
      power until the thing is done?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I do solemnly promise-on the conditions named.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very good. You will have ensured my fulfilment of my promise before I can
      ensure yours; but I take your word.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You will marry me on Friday! Give me your hand upon it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave him her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is it a covenant?' he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is,' said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Mountclere warmed from surface to centre as if he had drunk of
      hippocras, and, after holding her hand for some moments, raised it gently
      to his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Two days and you are mine,' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'That I believe I never shall be.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never shall be? Why, darling?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't know. Some catastrophe will prevent it. I shall be dead perhaps.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You distress me. Ah,-you meant me-you meant that I should be dead,
      because you think I am old! But that is a mistake-I am not very old!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I thought only of myself-nothing of you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, I know. Dearest, it is dismal and chilling here-let us go.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta mechanically moved with him, and felt there was no retreating
      now. In the meantime the young ladykin whom the solemn vowing concerned
      had lingered round the choir screen, as if fearing to enter, yet loth to
      go away. The service terminated, the heavy books were closed, doors were
      opened, and the feet of the few persons who had attended evensong began
      pattering down the paved alleys. Not wishing Picotee to know that the
      object of her secret excursion had been discovered, Ethelberta now stepped
      out of the west doorway with the viscount before Picotee had emerged from
      the other; and they walked along the path together until she overtook
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I fear it becomes necessary for me to stay in Melchester to-night,' said
      Lord Mountclere. 'I have a few matters to attend to here, as the result of
      our arrangements. But I will first accompany you as far as Anglebury, and
      see you safely into a carriage there that shall take you home. To-morrow I
      will drive to Knollsea, when we will make the final preparations.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta would not have him go so far and back again, merely to attend
      upon her; hence they parted at the railway, with due and correct
      tenderness; and when the train had gone, Lord Mountclere returned into the
      town on the special business he had mentioned, for which there remained
      only the present evening and the following morning, if he were to call
      upon her in the afternoon of the next day-the day before the wedding-now
      so recklessly hastened on his part, and so coolly assented to on hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time that the two young people had started it was nearly dark. Some
      portions of the railway stretched through little copses and plantations
      where, the leaf-shedding season being now at its height, red and golden
      patches of fallen foliage lay on either side of the rails; and as the
      travellers passed, all these death-stricken bodies boiled up in the
      whirlwind created by the velocity, and were sent flying right and left of
      them in myriads, a clean-fanned track being left behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Picotee was called from the observation of these phenomena by a remark
      from her sister: 'Picotee, the marriage is to be very early indeed. It is
      to be the day after to-morrow-if it can. Nevertheless I don't believe in
      the fact-I cannot.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Did you arrange it so? Nobody can make you marry so soon.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I agreed to the day,' murmured Ethelberta languidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How can it be? The gay dresses and the preparations and the people-how
      can they be collected in the time, Berta? And so much more of that will be
      required for a lord of the land than for a common man. O, I can't think it
      possible for a sister of mine to marry a lord!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And yet it has been possible any time this last month or two, strange as
      it seems to you. . . . It is to be not only a plain and simple wedding,
      without any lofty appliances, but a secret one-as secret as if I were some
      under-age heiress to an Indian fortune, and he a young man of nothing a
      year.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Has Lord Mountclere said it must be so private? I suppose it is on
      account of his family.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No. I say so; and it is on account of my family. Father might object to
      the wedding, I imagine, from what he once said, or he might be much
      disturbed about it; so I think it better that he and the rest should know
      nothing till all is over. You must dress again as my sister to-morrow,
      dear. Lord Mountclere is going to pay us an early visit to conclude
      necessary arrangements.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, the life as a lady at Enckworth Court! The flowers, the woods, the
      rooms, the pictures, the plate, and the jewels! Horses and carriages
      rattling and prancing, seneschals and pages, footmen hopping up and
      hopping down. It will be glory then!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'We might hire our father as one of my retainers, to increase it,' said
      Ethelberta drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Picotee's countenance fell. 'How shall we manage all about that? 'Tis
      terrible, really!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The marriage granted, those things will right themselves by time and
      weight of circumstances. You take a wrong view in thinking of glories of
      that sort. My only hope is that my life will be quite private and simple,
      as will best become my inferiority and Lord Mountclere's staidness. Such a
      splendid library as there is at Enckworth, Picotee-quartos, folios,
      history, verse, Elzevirs, Caxtons-all that has been done in literature
      from Moses down to Scott-with such companions I can do without all other
      sorts of happiness.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And you will not go to town from Easter to Lammastide, as other noble
      ladies do?' asked the younger girl, rather disappointed at this aspect of
      a viscountess's life.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't know.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But you will give dinners, and travel, and go to see his friends, and
      have them to see you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't know.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Will you not be, then, as any other peeress; and shall not I be as any
      other peeress's sister?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That, too, I do not know. All is mystery. Nor do I even know that the
      marriage will take place. I feel that it may not; and perhaps so much the
      better, since the man is a stranger to me. I know nothing whatever of his
      nature, and he knows nothing of mine.'

      40. MELCHESTER (continued)
    </h2>
    <p>
      The commotion wrought in Julian's mind by the abrupt incursion of
      Ethelberta into his quiet sphere was thorough and protracted. The witchery
      of her presence he had grown strong enough to withstand in part; but her
      composed announcement that she had intended to marry another, and, as far
      as he could understand, was intending it still, added a new chill to the
      old shade of disappointment which custom was day by day enabling him to
      endure. During the whole interval in which he had produced those diapason
      blasts, heard with such inharmonious feelings by the three auditors
      outside the screen, his thoughts had wandered wider than his notes in
      conjectures on the character and position of the gentleman seen in
      Ethelberta's company. Owing to his assumption that Lord Mountclere was but
      a stranger who had accidentally come in at the side door, Christopher had
      barely cast a glance upon him, and the wide difference between the years
      of the viscount and those of his betrothed was not so particularly
      observed as to raise that point to an item in his objections now. Lord
      Mountclere was dressed with all the cunning that could be drawn from the
      metropolis by money and reiterated dissatisfaction; he prided himself on
      his upright carriage; his stick was so thin that the most malevolent could
      not insinuate that it was of any possible use in walking; his teeth had
      put on all the vigour and freshness of a second spring. Hence his look was
      the slowest of possible clocks in respect of his age, and his manner was
      equally as much in the rear of his appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher was now over five-and-twenty. He was getting so well
      accustomed to the spectacle of a world passing him by and splashing him
      with its wheels that he wondered why he had ever minded it. His habit of
      dreaming instead of doing had led him up to a curious discovery. It is no
      new thing for a man to fathom profundities by indulging humours: the
      active, the rapid, the people of splendid momentum, have been surprised to
      behold what results attend the lives of those whose usual plan for
      discharging their active labours has been to postpone them indefinitely.
      Certainly, the immediate result in the present case was, to all but
      himself, small and invisible; but it was of the nature of highest things.
      What he had learnt was that a woman who has once made a permanent
      impression upon a man cannot altogether deny him her image by denying him
      her company, and that by sedulously cultivating the acquaintance of this
      Creature of Contemplation she becomes to him almost a living soul. Hence a
      sublimated Ethelberta accompanied him everywhere-one who never teased him,
      eluded him, or disappointed him: when he smiled she smiled, when he was
      sad she sorrowed. He may be said to have become the literal duplicate of
      that whimsical unknown rhapsodist who wrote of his own similar situation-
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    'By absence this good means I gain,
       That I can catch her,
       Where none can watch her,
    In some close corner of my brain:
       There I embrace and kiss her;
       And so I both enjoy and miss her.'
</pre>
    <p>
      This frame of mind naturally induced an amazing abstraction in the
      organist, never very vigilant at the best of times. He would stand and
      look fixedly at a frog in a shady pool, and never once think of
      batrachians, or pause by a green bank to split some tall blade of grass
      into filaments without removing it from its stalk, passing on ignorant
      that he had made a cat-o'-nine-tails of a graceful slip of vegetation. He
      would hear the cathedral clock strike one, and go the next minute to see
      what time it was. 'I never seed such a man as Mr. Julian is,' said the
      head blower. 'He'll meet me anywhere out-of-doors, and never wink or nod.
      You'd hardly expect it. I don't find fault, but you'd hardly expect it,
      seeing how I play the same instrument as he do himself, and have done it
      for so many years longer than he. How I have indulged that man, too! If
      'tis Pedals for two martel hours of practice I never complain; and he has
      plenty of vagaries. When 'tis hot summer weather there's nothing will do
      for him but Choir, Great, and Swell altogether, till yer face is in a
      vapour; and on a frosty winter night he'll keep me there while he tweedles
      upon the Twelfth and Sixteenth till my arms be scrammed for want of
      motion. And never speak a word out-of-doors.' Somebody suggested that
      perhaps Christopher did not notice his coadjutor's presence in the street;
      and time proved to the organ-blower that the remark was just.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever Christopher caught himself at these vacuous tricks he would be
      struck with admiration of Ethelberta's wisdom, foresight, and self-command
      in refusing to wed such an incapable man: he felt that he ought to be
      thankful that a bright memory of her was not also denied to him, and
      resolved to be content with it as a possession, since it was as much of
      her as he could decently maintain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wrapped thus in a humorous sadness he passed the afternoon under notice,
      and in the evening went home to Faith, who still lived with him, and
      showed no sign of ever being likely to do otherwise. Their present place
      and mode of life suited her well. She revived at Melchester like an exotic
      sent home again. The leafy Close, the climbing buttresses, the pondering
      ecclesiastics, the great doors, the singular keys, the whispered talk,
      echoes of lonely footsteps, the sunset shadow of the tall steeple,
      reaching further into the town than the good bishop's teaching, and the
      general complexion of a spot where morning had the stillness of evening
      and spring some of the tones of autumn, formed a proper background to a
      person constituted as Faith, who, like Miss Hepzibah Pyncheon's chicken,
      possessed in miniature all the antiquity of her progenitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      After tea Christopher went into the streets, as was frequently his custom,
      less to see how the world crept on there than to walk up and down for
      nothing at all. It had been market-day, and remnants of the rural
      population that had visited the town still lingered at corners, their toes
      hanging over the edge of the pavement, and their eyes wandering about the
      street.
    </p>
    <p>
      The angle which formed the turning-point of Christopher's promenade was
      occupied by a jeweller's shop, of a standing which completely outshone
      every other shop in that or any trade throughout the town. Indeed, it was
      a staple subject of discussion in Melchester how a shop of such
      pretensions could find patronage sufficient to support its existence in a
      place which, though well populated, was not fashionable. It had not long
      been established there, and was the enterprise of an incoming man whose
      whole course of procedure seemed to be dictated by an intention to
      astonish the native citizens very considerably before he had done. Nearly
      everything was glass in the frontage of this fairy mart, and its contents
      glittered like the hammochrysos stone. The panes being of plate-glass, and
      the shop having two fronts, a diagonal view could be had through it from
      one to the other of the streets to which it formed a corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      This evening, as on all evenings, a flood of radiance spread from the
      window-lamps into the thick autumn air, so that from a distance that
      corner appeared as the glistening nucleus of all the light in the town.
      Towards it idle men and women unconsciously bent their steps, and closed
      in upon the panes like night-birds upon the lantern of a lighthouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Christopher reached the spot there stood close to the pavement a
      plain close carriage, apparently waiting for some person who was
      purchasing inside. Christopher would hardly have noticed this had he not
      also perceived, pressed against the glass of the shop window, an unusual
      number of local noses belonging to overgrown working lads, tosspots, an
      idiot, the ham-smoker's assistant with his sleeves rolled up, a
      scot-and-lot freeholder, three or four seamstresses, the young woman who
      brought home the washing, and so on. The interest of these gazers in some
      proceedings within, which by reason of the gaslight were as public as if
      carried on in the open air, was very great.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, that's what he's a buying o'-haw, haw!' said one of the young men,
      as the shopman removed from the window a gorgeous blue velvet tray of
      wedding-rings, and laid it on the counter.
    </p>
    <p>
      ''Tis what you may come to yerself, sooner or later, God have mercy upon
      ye; and as such no scoffing matter,' said an older man. 'Faith, I'd as
      lief cry as laugh to see a man in that corner.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He's a gent getting up in years too. He must hev been through it a few
      times afore, seemingly, to sit down and buy the tools so cool as that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, no. See what the shyest will do at such times. You bain't yerself
      then; no man living is hisself then.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'True,' said the ham-smoker's man. ''Tis a thought to look at that a chap
      will take all this trouble to get a woman into his house, and a
      twelvemonth after would as soon hear it thunder as hear her sing!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The policeman standing near was a humane man, through having a young
      family he could hardly keep, and he hesitated about telling them to move
      on. Christopher had before this time perceived that the articles were laid
      down before an old gentleman who was seated in the shop, and that the
      gentleman was none other than he who had been with Ethelberta in the
      concert-room. The discovery was so startling that, constitutionally
      indisposed as he was to stand and watch, he became as glued to the spot as
      the other idlers. Finding himself now for the first time directly
      confronting the preliminaries of Ethelberta's marriage to a stranger, he
      was left with far less equanimity than he could have supposed possible to
      the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      'So near the time!' he said, and looked hard at Lord Mountclere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher had now a far better opportunity than before for observing
      Ethelberta's betrothed. Apart from any bias of jealousy, disappointment,
      or mortification, he was led to judge that this was not quite the man to
      make Ethelberta happy. He had fancied her companion to be a man under
      fifty; he was now visibly sixty or more. And it was not the sort of
      sexagenarianism beside which a young woman's happiness can sometimes
      contrive to keep itself alive in a quiet sleepy way. Suddenly it occurred
      to him that this was the man whom he had helped in the carriage accident
      on the way to Knollsea. He looked again.
    </p>
    <p>
      By no means undignified, the face presented that combination of slyness
      and jocundity which we are accustomed to imagine of the canonical
      jolly-dogs in mediaeval tales. The gamesome Curate of Meudon might have
      supplied some parts of the countenance; cunning Friar Tuck the remainder.
      Nothing but the viscount's constant habit of going to church every Sunday
      morning when at his country residence kept unholiness out of his features,
      for though he lived theologically enough on the Sabbath, as it became a
      man in his position to do, he was strikingly mundane all the rest of the
      week, always preferring the devil to God in his oaths. And nothing but
      antecedent good-humour prevented the short fits of crossness incident to
      his passing infirmities from becoming established. His look was
      exceptionally jovial now, and the corners of his mouth twitched as the
      telegraph-needles of a hundred little erotic messages from his heart to
      his brain. Anybody could see that he was a merry man still, who loved good
      company, warming drinks, nymph-like shapes, and pretty words, in spite of
      the disagreeable suggestions he received from the pupils of his eyes, and
      the joints of his lively limbs, that imps of mischief were busy sapping
      and mining in those regions, with the view of tumbling him into a certain
      cool cellar under the church aisle.
    </p>
    <p>
      In general, if a lover can find any ground at all for serenity in the tide
      of an elderly rival's success, he finds it in the fact itself of that
      ancientness. The other side seems less a rival than a makeshift. But
      Christopher no longer felt this, and the significant signs before his eyes
      of the imminence of Ethelberta's union with this old hero filled him with
      restless dread. True, the gentleman, as he appeared illuminated by the
      jeweller's gas-jets, seemed more likely to injure Ethelberta by indulgence
      than by severity, while her beauty lasted; but there was a nameless
      something in him less tolerable than this.
    </p>
    <p>
      The purchaser having completed his dealings with the goldsmith, was
      conducted to the door by the master of the shop, and into the carriage,
      which was at once driven off up the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher now much desired to know the name of the man whom a nice chain
      of circumstantial evidence taught him to regard as the happy winner where
      scores had lost. He was grieved that Ethelberta's confessed reserve should
      have extended so far as to limit her to mere indefinite hints of marriage
      when they were talking almost on the brink of the wedding-day. That the
      ceremony was to be a private one-which it probably would be because of the
      disparity of ages-did not in his opinion justify her secrecy. He had shown
      himself capable of a transmutation as valuable as it is rare in men, the
      change from pestering lover to staunch friend, and this was all he had got
      for it. But even an old lover sunk to an indifferentist might have been
      tempted to spend an unoccupied half-hour in discovering particulars now,
      and Christopher had not lapsed nearly so far as to absolute unconcern.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening, however, nothing came in his way to enlighten him. But the
      next day, when skirting the Close on his ordinary duties, he saw the same
      carriage standing at a distance, and paused to behold the same old
      gentleman come from a well-known office and re-enter the vehicle-Lord
      Mountclere, in fact, in earnest pursuit of the business of yesternight,
      having just pocketed a document in which romance, rashness, law, and
      gospel are so happily made to work together that it may safely be regarded
      as the neatest compromise which has ever been invented since Adam sinned.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time Julian perceived that the brougham was one belonging to the
      White Hart Hotel, which Lord Mountclere was using partly from the
      necessities of these hasty proceedings, and also because, by so doing, he
      escaped the notice that might have been bestowed upon his own equipage, or
      men-servants, the Mountclere hammer-cloths being known in Melchester.
      Christopher now walked towards the hotel, leisurely, yet with anxiety. He
      inquired of a porter what people were staying there that day, and was
      informed that they had only one person in the house, Lord Mountclere, whom
      sudden and unexpected business had detained in Melchester since the
      previous day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher lingered to hear no more. He retraced the street much more
      quickly than he had come; and he only said, 'Lord Mountclere-it must never
      be!'
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as he entered the house, Faith perceived that he was greatly
      agitated. He at once told her of his discovery, and she exclaimed, 'What a
      brilliant match!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O Faith,' said Christopher, 'you don't know! You are far from knowing. It
      is as gloomy as midnight. Good God, can it be possible?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Faith bHANDlinked in alarm, without speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Did you never hear anything of Lord Mountclere when we lived at
      Sandbourne?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I knew the name-no more.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, no-of course you did not. Well, though I never saw his face, to my
      knowledge, till a short time ago, I know enough to say that, if earnest
      representations can prevent it, this marriage shall not be. Father knew
      him, or about him, very well; and he once told me-what I cannot tell you.
      Fancy, I have seen him three times-yesterday, last night, and this
      morning-besides helping him on the road some weeks ago, and never once
      considered that he might be Lord Mountclere. He is here almost in
      disguise, one may say; neither man nor horse is with him; and his object
      accounts for his privacy. I see how it is-she is doing this to benefit her
      brothers and sisters, if possible; but she ought to know that if she is
      miserable they will never be happy. That's the nature of women-they take
      the form for the essence, and that's what she is doing now. I should think
      her guardian angel must have quitted her when she agreed to a marriage
      which may tear her heart out like a claw.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are too warm about it, Kit-it cannot be so bad as that. It is not the
      thing, but the sensitiveness to the thing, which is the true measure of
      its pain. Perhaps what seems so bad to you falls lightly on her mind. A
      campaigner in a heavy rain is not more uncomfortable than we are in a
      slight draught; and Ethelberta, fortified by her sapphires and gold cups
      and wax candles, will not mind facts which look like spectres to us
      outside. A title will turn troubles into romances, and she will shine as
      an interesting viscountess in spite of them.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The discussion with Faith was not continued, Christopher stopping the
      argument by saying that he had a good mind to go off at once to Knollsea,
      and show her her danger. But till the next morning Ethelberta was
      certainly safe; no marriage was possible anywhere before then. He passed
      the afternoon in a state of great indecision, constantly reiterating, 'I
      will go!'

    <h2>
      41. WORKSHOPS-AN INN-THE STREET
    </h2>
    <p>
      On an extensive plot of ground, lying somewhere between the Thames and the
      Kensington squares, stood the premises of Messrs. Nockett and Perch,
      builders and contractors. The yard with its workshops formed part of one
      of those frontier lines between mangy business and garnished domesticity
      that occur in what are called improving neighbourhoods. We are accustomed
      to regard increase as the chief feature in a great city's progress, its
      well-known signs greeting our eyes on every outskirt. Slush-ponds may be
      seen turning into basement-kitchens; a broad causeway of shattered
      earthenware smothers plots of budding gooseberry-bushes and vegetable
      trenches, foundations following so closely upon gardens that the
      householder may be expected to find cadaverous sprouts from overlooked
      potatoes rising through the chinks of his cellar floor. But the other
      great process, that of internal transmutation, is not less curious than
      this encroachment of grey upon green. Its first erections are often only
      the milk-teeth of a suburb, and as the district rises in dignity they are
      dislodged by those which are to endure. Slightness becomes supplanted by
      comparative solidity, commonness by novelty, lowness and irregularity by
      symmetry and height.
    </p>
    <p>
      An observer of the precinct which has been named as an instance in point
      might have stood under a lamp-post and heard simultaneously the peal of
      the visitor's bell from the new terrace on the right hand, and the stroke
      of tools from the musty workshops on the left. Waggons laden with deals
      came up on this side, and landaus came down on the other-the former to
      lumber heavily through the old-established contractors' gates, the latter
      to sweep fashionably into the square.
    </p>
    <p>
      About twelve o'clock on the day following Lord Mountclere's exhibition of
      himself to Christopher in the jeweller's shop at Melchester, and almost at
      the identical time when the viscount was seen to come from the office for
      marriage-licences in the same place, a carriage drove nearly up to the
      gates of Messrs. Nockett and Co.'s yard. A gentleman stepped out and
      looked around. He was a man whose years would have been pronounced as
      five-and-forty by the friendly, fifty by the candid, fifty-two or three by
      the grim. He was as handsome a study in grey as could be seen in town,
      there being far more of the raven's plumage than of the gull's in the
      mixture as yet; and he had a glance of that practised sort which can
      measure people, weigh them, repress them, encourage them to sprout and
      blossom as a March sun encourages crocuses, ask them questions, give them
      answers-in short, a glance that could do as many things as an American
      cooking-stove or a multum-in-parvo pocket-knife. But, as with most men of
      the world, this was mere mechanism: his actual emotions were kept so far
      within his person that they were rarely heard or seen near his features.
    </p>
    <p>
      On reading the builders' names over the gateway he entered the yard, and
      asked at the office if Solomon Chickerel was engaged on the premises. The
      clerk was going to be very attentive, but finding the visitor had come
      only to speak to a workman, his tense attitude slackened a little, and he
      merely signified the foot of a Flemish ladder on the other side of the
      yard, saying, 'You will find him, sir, up there in the joiner's shop.'
    </p>
    <p>
      When the man in the black coat reached the top he found himself at the end
      of a long apartment as large as a chapel and as low as a malt-room, across
      which ran parallel carpenters' benches to the number of twenty or more, a
      gangway being left at the side for access throughout. Behind every bench
      there stood a man or two, planing, fitting, or chiselling, as the case
      might be. The visitor paused for a moment, as if waiting for some
      cessation of their violent motions and uproar till he could make his
      errand known. He waited ten seconds, he waited twenty; but, beyond that a
      quick look had been thrown upon him by every pair of eyes, the muscular
      performances were in no way interrupted: every one seemed oblivious of his
      presence, and absolutely regardless of his wish. In truth, the texture of
      that salmon-coloured skin could be seen to be aristocratic without a
      microscope, and the exceptious artizan has an offhand way when contrasts
      are made painfully strong by an idler of this kind coming, gloved and
      brushed, into the very den where he is sweating and muddling in his
      shirt-sleeves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman from the carriage then proceeded down the workshop, wading
      up to his knees in a sea of shavings, and bruising his ankles against
      corners of board and sawn-off blocks, that lay hidden like reefs beneath.
      At the ninth bench he made another venture.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sol Chickerel?' said the man addressed, as he touched his plane-iron upon
      the oilstone. 'He's one of them just behind.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Damn it all, can't one of you show me?' the visitor angrily observed, for
      he had been used to more attention than this. 'Here, point him out.' He
      handed the man a shilling.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No trouble to do that,' said the workman; and he turned and signified Sol
      by a nod without moving from his place.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger entered Sol's division, and, nailing him with his eye, said
      at once: 'I want to speak a few words with you in private. Is not a Mrs.
      Petherwin your sister?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Sol started suspiciously. 'Has anything happened to her?' he at length
      said hurriedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no. It is on a business matter that I have called. You need not mind
      owning the relationship to me-the secret will be kept. I am the brother of
      one whom you may have heard of from her-Lord Mountclere.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have not. But if you will wait a minute, sir-' He went to a little
      glazed box at the end of the shop, where the foreman was sitting, and,
      after speaking a few words to this person, Sol led Mountclere to the door,
      and down the ladder.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I suppose we cannot very well talk here, after all?' said the gentleman,
      when they reached the yard, and found several men moving about therein.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Perhaps we had better go to some room-the nearest inn will answer the
      purpose, won't it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Excellently.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'There's the "Green Bushes" over the way. They have a very nice private
      room upstairs.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, that will do.' And passing out of the yard, the man with the glance
      entered the inn with Sol, where they were shown to the parlour as
      requested.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the waiter was gone for some wine, which Mountclere ordered, the
      more ingenuous of the two resumed the conversation by saying, awkwardly:
      'Yes, Mrs. Petherwin is my sister, as you supposed, sir; but on her
      account I do not let it be known.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Indeed,' said Mountclere. 'Well, I came to see you in order to speak of a
      matter which I thought you might know more about than I do, for it has
      taken me quite by surprise. My brother, Lord Mountclere, is, it seems, to
      be privately married to Mrs. Petherwin to-morrow.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is that really the fact?' said Sol, becoming quite shaken. 'I had no
      thought that such a thing could be possible!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is imminent.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Father has told me that she has lately got to know some nobleman; but I
      never supposed there could be any meaning in that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You were altogether wrong,' said Mountclere, leaning back in his chair
      and looking at Sol steadily. 'Do you feel it to be a matter upon which you
      will congratulate her?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A very different thing!' said Sol vehemently. 'Though he is your brother,
      sir, I must say this, that I would rather she married the poorest man I
      know.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'From what my father has told me of him, he is not-a more desirable
      brother-in-law to me than I shall be in all likelihood to him. What
      business has a man of that character to marry Berta, I should like to
      ask?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's what I say,' returned Mountclere, revealing his satisfaction at
      Sol's estimate of his noble brother: it showed that he had calculated well
      in coming here. 'My brother is getting old, and he has lived strangely:
      your sister is a highly respectable young lady.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And he is not respectable, you mean? I know he is not. I worked near
      Enckworth once.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I cannot say that,' returned Mountclere. Possibly a certain fraternal
      feeling repressed a direct assent: and yet this was the only
      representation which could be expected to prejudice the young man against
      the wedding, if he were such an one as the visitor supposed Sol to be-a
      man vulgar in sentiment and ambition, but pure in his anxiety for his
      sister's happiness. 'At any rate, we are agreed in thinking that this
      would be an unfortunate marriage for both,' added Mountclere.
    </p>
    <p>
      'About both I don't know. It may be a good thing for him. When do you say
      it is to be, sir-to-morrow?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't know what to do!' said Sol, walking up and down. 'If half what I
      have heard is true, I would lose a winter's work to prevent her marrying
      him. What does she want to go mixing in with people who despise her for?
      Now look here, Mr. Mountclere, since you have been and called me out to
      talk this over, it is only fair that you should tell me the exact truth
      about your brother. Is it a lie, or is it true, that he is not fit to be
      the husband of a decent woman?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That is a curious inquiry,' said Mountclere, whose manner and aspect,
      neutral as a winter landscape, had little in common with Sol's warm and
      unrestrained bearing. 'There are reasons why I think your sister will not
      be happy with him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then it is true what they say,' said Sol, bringing down his fist upon the
      table. 'I know your meaning well enough. What's to be done? If I could
      only see her this minute, she might be kept out of it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You think your presence would influence your sister-if you could see her
      before the wedding?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I think it would. But who's to get at her?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am going, so you had better come on with me-unless it would be best for
      your father to come.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Perhaps it might,' said the bewildered Sol. 'But he will not be able to
      get away; and it's no use for Dan to go. If anybody goes I must! If she
      has made up her mind nothing can be done by writing to her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I leave at once to see Lord Mountclere,' the other continued. 'I feel
      that as my brother is evidently ignorant of the position of Mrs.
      Petherwin's family and connections, it is only fair in me, as his nearest
      relative, to make them clear to him before it is too late.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You mean that if he knew her friends were working-people he would not
      think of her as a wife? 'Tis a reasonable thought. But make your mind
      easy: she has told him. I make a great mistake if she has for a moment
      thought of concealing that from him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She may not have deliberately done so. But-and I say this with no
      ill-feeling-it is a matter known to few, and she may have taken no steps
      to undeceive him. I hope to bring him to see the matter clearly.
      Unfortunately the thing has been so secret and hurried that there is
      barely time. I knew nothing until this morning-never dreamt of such a
      preposterous occurrence.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Preposterous! If it should come to pass, she would play her part as his
      lady as well as any other woman, and better. I wish there was no more
      reason for fear on my side than there is on yours! Things have come to a
      sore head when she is not considered lady enough for such as he. But
      perhaps your meaning is, that if your brother were to have a son, you
      would lose your heir-presumptive title to the cor'net of Mountclere? Well,
      'twould be rather hard for ye, now I come to think o't-upon my life,
      'twould.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The suggestion is as delicate as the &mdash;- atmosphere of this vile
      room. But let your ignorance be your excuse, my man. It is hardly worth
      while for us to quarrel when we both have the same object in view: do you
      think so?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's true-that's true. When do you start, sir?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'We must leave almost at once,' said Mountclere, looking at his watch. 'If
      we cannot catch the two o'clock train, there is no getting there
      to-night-and to-morrow we could not possibly arrive before one.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I wish there was time for me to go and tidy myself a bit,' said Sol,
      anxiously looking down at his working clothes. 'I suppose you would not
      like me to go with you like this?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Confound the clothes! If you cannot start in five minutes, we shall not
      be able to go at all.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very well, then-wait while I run across to the shop, then I am ready. How
      do we get to the station?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'My carriage is at the corner waiting. When you come out I will meet you
      at the gates.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Sol then hurried downstairs, and a minute or two later Mr. Mountclere
      followed, looking like a man bent on policy at any price. The carriage was
      brought round by the time that Sol reappeared from the yard. He entered
      and sat down beside Mountclere, not without a sense that he was spoiling
      good upholstery; the coachman then allowed the lash of his whip to alight
      with the force of a small fly upon the horses, which set them up in an
      angry trot. Sol rolled on beside his new acquaintance with the shamefaced
      look of a man going to prison in a van, for pedestrians occasionally gazed
      at him, full of what seemed to himself to be ironical surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am afraid I ought to have changed my clothes after all,' he said,
      writhing under a perception of the contrast between them. 'Not knowing
      anything about this, I ain't a bit prepared. If I had got even my
      second-best hat, it wouldn't be so bad.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It makes no difference,' said Mountclere inanimately.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Or I might have brought my portmantle, with some things.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It really is not important.'
    </p>
    <p>
      On reaching the station they found there were yet a few minutes to spare,
      which Sol made use of in writing a note to his father, to explain what had
      occurred.

      42. THE DONCASTLES' RESIDENCE, AND OUTSIDE THE SAME
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mrs. Doncastle's dressing-bell had rung, but Menlove, the lady's maid,
      having at the same time received a letter by the evening post, paused to
      read it before replying to the summons:-
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    'ENCKWORTH COURT, Wednesday.

    DARLING LOUISA,-I can assure you that I am no more likely than yourself to form another attachment, as you will perceive by what follows.  Before we left town I thought that to be able to see you occasionally was sufficient for happiness, but down in this lonely place the case is different.  In short, my dear, I ask you to consent to a union with me as soon as you possibly can.  Your prettiness has won my eyes and lips completely, sweet, and I lie awake at night to think of the golden curls you allowed to escape from their confinement on those nice times of private clothes, when we walked in the park and slipped the bonds of service, which you were never born to any more than I. . . .

    'Had not my own feelings been so strong, I should have told you at the first dash of my pen that what I expected is coming to pass at last-the old dog is going to be privately married to Mrs. P.  Yes, indeed, and the wedding is coming off to-morrow, secret as the grave.  All her friends will doubtless leave service on account of it.  What he does now makes little difference to me, of course, as I had already given warning, but I shall stick to him like a Briton in spite of it.  He has to-day made me a present, and a further five pounds for yourself, expecting you to hold your tongue on every matter connected with Mrs. P.'s friends, and to say nothing to any of them about this marriage until it is over.  His lordship impressed this upon me very strong, and familiar as a brother, and of course we obey his instructions to the letter; for I need hardly say that unless he keeps his promise to help me in setting up the shop, our nuptials cannot be consumed.  His help depends upon our obedience, as you are aware. . . .'
</pre>
    <p>
      This, and much more, was from her very last lover, Lord Mountclere's
      valet, who had been taken in hand directly she had convinced herself of
      Joey's hopeless youthfulness. The missive sent Mrs. Menlove's spirits
      soaring like spring larks; she flew upstairs in answer to the bell with a
      joyful, triumphant look, which the illuminated figure of Mrs. Doncastle in
      her dressing-room could not quite repress. One could almost forgive
      Menlove her arts when so modest a result brought such vast content.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Doncastle seemed inclined to make no remark during the dressing, and
      at last Menlove could repress herself no longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I should like to name something to you, m'm.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I shall be wishing to leave soon, if it is convenient.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very well, Menlove,' answered Mrs. Doncastle, as she serenely surveyed
      her right eyebrow in the glass. 'Am I to take this as a formal notice?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If you please; but I could stay a week or two beyond the month if
      suitable. I am going to be married-that's what it is, m'm.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O! I am glad to hear it, though I am sorry to lose you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is Lord Mountclere's valet-Mr. Tipman-m'm.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Indeed.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Menlove went on building up Mrs. Doncastle's hair awhile in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I suppose you heard the other news that arrived in town to-day, m'm?' she
      said again. 'Lord Mountclere is going to be married to-morrow.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'To-morrow? Are you quite sure?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O yes, m'm. Mr. Tipman has just told me so in his letter. He is going to
      be married to Mrs. Petherwin. It is to be quite a private wedding.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Doncastle made no remark, and she remained in the same still position
      as before; but a countenance expressing transcendent surprise was
      reflected to Menlove by the glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this sight Menlove's tongue so burned to go further, and unfold the
      lady's relations with the butler downstairs, that she would have lost a
      month's wages to be at liberty to do it. The disclosure was almost too
      magnificent to be repressed. To deny herself so exquisite an indulgence
      required an effort which nothing on earth could have sustained save the
      one thing that did sustain it-the knowledge that upon her silence hung the
      most enormous desideratum in the world, her own marriage. She said no
      more, and Mrs. Doncastle went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an ordinary family dinner that day, but their nephew Neigh happened
      to be present. Just as they were sitting down Mrs. Doncastle said to her
      husband: 'Why have you not told me of the wedding to-morrow?-or don't you
      know anything about it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Wedding?' said Mr. Doncastle.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lord Mountclere is to be married to Mrs. Petherwin quite privately.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good God!' said some person.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Doncastle did not speak the words; they were not spoken by Neigh: they
      seemed to float over the room and round the walls, as if originating in
      some spiritualistic source. Yet Mrs. Doncastle, remembering the symptoms
      of attachment between Ethelberta and her nephew which had appeared during
      the summer, looked towards Neigh instantly, as if she thought the words
      must have come from him after all; but Neigh's face was perfectly calm;
      he, together with her husband, was sitting with his eyes fixed in the
      direction of the sideboard; and turning to the same spot she beheld
      Chickerel standing pale as death, his lips being parted as if he did not
      know where he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Did you speak?' said Mrs. Doncastle, looking with astonishment at the
      butler.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Chickerel, what's the matter-are you ill?' said Mr. Doncastle
      simultaneously. 'Was it you who said that?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I did, sir,' said Chickerel in a husky voice, scarcely above a whisper.
      'I could not help it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She is my daughter, and it shall be known at once!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who is your daughter?'
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused a few moments nervously. 'Mrs. Petherwin,' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon this announcement Neigh looked at poor Chickerel as if he saw through
      him into the wall. Mrs. Doncastle uttered a faint exclamation and leant
      back in her chair: the bare possibility of the truth of Chickerel's claims
      to such paternity shook her to pieces when she viewed her intimacies with
      Ethelberta during the past season-the court she had paid her, the
      arrangements she had entered into to please her; above all, the
      dinner-party which she had contrived and carried out solely to gratify
      Lord Mountclere and bring him into personal communication with the general
      favourite; thus making herself probably the chief though unconscious
      instrument in promoting a match by which her butler was to become
      father-in-law to a peer she delighted to honour. The crowd of perceptions
      almost took away her life; she closed her eyes in a white shiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you mean to say that the lady who sat here at dinner at the same time
      that Lord Mountclere was present, is your daughter?' asked Doncastle.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, sir,' said Chickerel respectfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How did she come to be your daughter?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I- Well, she is my daughter, sir.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Did you educate her?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not altogether, sir. She was a very clever child. Lady Petherwin took a
      deal of trouble about her education. They were both left widows about the
      same time: the son died, then the father. My daughter was only seventeen
      then. But though she's older now, her marriage with Lord Mountclere means
      misery. He ought to marry another woman.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is very extraordinary,' Mr. Doncastle murmured. 'If you are ill you
      had better go and rest yourself, Chickerel. Send in Thomas.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Chickerel, who seemed to be much disturbed, then very gladly left the
      room, and dinner proceeded. But such was the peculiarity of the case,
      that, though there was in it neither murder, robbery, illness, accident,
      fire, or any other of the tragic and legitimate shakers of human nerves,
      two of the three who were gathered there sat through the meal without the
      least consciousness of what viands had composed it. Impressiveness depends
      as much upon propinquity as upon magnitude; and to have honoured unawares
      the daughter of the vilest Antipodean miscreant and murderer would have
      been less discomfiting to Mrs. Doncastle than it was to make the same
      blunder with the daughter of a respectable servant who happened to live in
      her own house. To Neigh the announcement was as the catastrophe of a story
      already begun, rather than as an isolated wonder. Ethelberta's words had
      prepared him for something, though the nature of that thing was unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Chickerel ought not to have kept us in ignorance of this-of course he
      ought not!' said Mrs. Doncastle, as soon as they were left alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't see why not,' replied Mr. Doncastle, who took the matter very
      coolly, as was his custom.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then she herself should have let it be known.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nor does that follow. You didn't tell Mrs. Petherwin that your
      grandfather narrowly escaped hanging for shooting his rival in a duel.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of course not. There was no reason why I should give extraneous
      information.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nor was there any reason why she should. As for Chickerel, he doubtless
      felt how unbecoming it would be to make personal remarks upon one of your
      guests-Ha-ha-ha! Well, well-Ha-ha-ha-ha!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I know this,' said Mrs. Doncastle, in great anger, 'that if my father had
      been in the room, I should not have let the fact pass unnoticed, and
      treated him like a stranger!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Would you have had her introduce Chickerel to us all round? My dear
      Margaret, it was a complicated position for a woman.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then she ought not to have come!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'There may be something in that, though she was dining out at other houses
      as good as ours. Well, I should have done just as she did, for the joke of
      the thing. Ha-ha-ha!-it is very good-very. It was a case in which the
      appetite for a jest would overpower the sting of conscience in any
      well-constituted being-that, my dear, I must maintain.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I say she should not have come!' answered Mrs. Doncastle firmly. 'Of
      course I shall dismiss Chickerel.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of course you will do no such thing. I have never had a butler in the
      house before who suited me so well. It is a great credit to the man to
      have such a daughter, and I am not sure that we do not derive some lustre
      of a humble kind from his presence in the house. But, seriously, I wonder
      at your short-sightedness, when you know the troubles we have had through
      getting new men from nobody knows where.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Neigh, perceiving that the breeze in the atmosphere might ultimately
      intensify to a palpable black squall, seemed to think it would be well to
      take leave of his uncle and aunt as soon as he conveniently could;
      nevertheless, he was much less discomposed by the situation than by the
      active cause which had led to it. When Mrs. Doncastle arose, her husband
      said he was going to speak to Chickerel for a minute or two, and Neigh
      followed his aunt upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Doncastle joined them. 'I have been talking to Chickerel,' he
      said. 'It is a very curious affair-this marriage of his daughter and Lord
      Mountclere. The whole situation is the most astounding I have ever met
      with. The man is quite ill about the news. He has shown me a letter which
      has just reached him from his son on the same subject. Lord Mountclere's
      brother and this young man have actually gone off together to try to
      prevent the wedding, and Chickerel has asked to be allowed to go himself,
      if he can get soon enough to the station to catch the night mail. Of
      course he may go if he wishes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What a funny thing!' said the lady, with a wretchedly factitious smile.
      'The times have taken a strange turn when the angry parent of the comedy,
      who goes post-haste to prevent the undutiful daughter's rash marriage, is
      a gentleman from below stairs, and the unworthy lover a peer of the
      realm!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Neigh spoke for almost the first time. 'I don't blame Chickerel in
      objecting to Lord Mountclere. I should object to him myself if I had a
      daughter. I never liked him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why?' said Mrs. Doncastle, lifting her eyelids as if the act were a heavy
      task.
    </p>
    <p>
      'For reasons which don't generally appear.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' said Mr. Doncastle, in a low tone. 'Still, we must not believe all
      we hear.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is Chickerel going?' said Neigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He leaves in five or ten minutes,' said Doncastle.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a few further words Neigh mentioned that he was unable to stay
      longer that evening, and left them. When he had reached the outside of the
      door he walked a little way up the pavement and back again, as if
      reluctant to lose sight of the street, finally standing under a lamp-post
      whence he could command a view of Mr. Doncastle's front. Presently a man
      came out in a great-coat and with a small bag in his hand; Neigh at once
      recognizing the person as Chickerel, went up to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr. Doncastle tells me you are going on a sudden journey. At what time
      does your train leave?' Neigh asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I go by the ten o'clock, sir: I hope it is a third-class,' said
      Chickerel; 'though I am afraid it may not be.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is as much as you will do to get to the station,' said Neigh, turning
      the face of his watch to the light. 'Here, come into my cab-I am driving
      that way.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Thank you, sir,' said Chickerel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neigh called a cab at the first opportunity, and they entered and drove
      along together. Neither spoke during the journey. When they were driving
      up to the station entrance Neigh looked again to see the hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You have not a minute to lose,' he said, in repressed anxiety. 'And your
      journey will be expensive: instead of walking from Anglebury to Knollsea,
      you had better drive-above all, don't lose time. Never mind what class the
      train is. Take this from me, since the emergency is great.' He handed
      something to Chickerel folded up small.
    </p>
    <p>
      The butler took it without inquiry, and stepped out hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I sincerely hope she- Well, good-night, Chickerel,' continued Neigh,
      ending his words abruptly. The cab containing him drove again towards the
      station-gates, leaving Chickerel standing on the kerb.
    </p>
    <p>
      He passed through the booking-office, and looked at the paper Neigh had
      put into his hand. It was a five-pound note.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chickerel mused on the circumstance as he took his ticket and got into the
      train.

    <h2>
      43. THE RAILWAY-THE SEA-THE SHORE BEYOND
    </h2>
    <p>
      By this time Sol and the Honourable Edgar Mountclere had gone far on their
      journey into Wessex. Enckworth Court, Mountclere's destination, though
      several miles from Knollsea, was most easily accessible by the same route
      as that to the village, the latter being the place for which Sol was
      bound.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the few words that passed between them on the way, Mountclere became
      more stubborn than ever in a belief that this was a carefully laid trap of
      the fair Ethelberta's to ensnare his brother without revealing to him her
      family ties, which it therefore behoved him to make clear, with the utmost
      force of representation, before the fatal union had been contracted. Being
      himself the viscount's only remaining brother and near relative, the
      disinterestedness of his motives may be left to imagination; that there
      was much real excuse for his conduct must, however, be borne in mind.
      Whether his attempt would prevent the union was another question: he
      believed that, conjoined with his personal influence over the viscount,
      and the importation of Sol as a firebrand to throw between the betrothed
      pair, it might do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      About half-an-hour before sunset the two individuals, HANDlinked by their
      differences, reached the point of railway at which the branch to
      Sandbourne left the main line. They had taken tickets for Sandbourne,
      intending to go thence to Knollsea by the steamer that plied between the
      two places during the summer months-making this a short and direct route.
      But it occurred to Mountclere on the way that, summer being over, the
      steamer might possibly have left off running, the wind might be too high
      for a small boat, and no large one might be at hand for hire: therefore it
      would be safer to go by train to Anglebury, and the remaining sixteen
      miles by driving over the hills, even at a great loss of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accident, however, determined otherwise. They were in the station at the
      junction, inquiring of an official if the Speedwell had ceased to sail,
      when a countryman who had just come up from Sandbourne stated that, though
      the Speedwell had left off for the year, there was that day another
      steamer at Sandbourne. This steamer would of necessity return to Knollsea
      that evening, partly because several people from that place had been on
      board, and also because the Knollsea folk were waiting for groceries and
      draperies from London: there was not an ounce of tea or a hundredweight of
      coal in the village, owing to the recent winds, which had detained the
      provision parcels at Sandbourne, and kept the colliers up-channel until
      the change of weather this day. To introduce necessaries by a roundabout
      land journey was not easy when they had been ordered by the other and
      habitual route. The boat returned at six o'clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      So on they went to Sandbourne, driving off to the pier directly they
      reached that place, for it was getting towards night. The steamer was
      there, as the man had told them, much to the relief of Sol, who, being
      extremely anxious to enter Knollsea before a late hour, had known that
      this was the only way in which it could be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some unforeseen incident delayed the boat, and they walked up and down the
      pier to wait. The prospect was gloomy enough. The wind was north-east; the
      sea along shore was a chalky-green, though comparatively calm, this part
      of the coast forming a shelter from wind in its present quarter. The
      clouds had different velocities, and some of them shone with a coppery
      glare, produced by rays from the west which did not enter the inferior
      atmosphere at all. It was reflected on the distant waves in patches, with
      an effect as if the waters were at those particular spots stained with
      blood. This departed, and what daylight was left to the earth came from
      strange and unusual quarters of the heavens. The zenith would be bright,
      as if that were the place of the sun; then all overhead would close, and a
      whiteness in the east would give the appearance of morning; while a bank
      as thick as a wall barricaded the west, which looked as if it had no
      acquaintance with sunsets, and would blush red no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Any other passengers?' shouted the master of the steamboat. 'We must be
      off: it may be a dirty night.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Sol and Mountclere went on board, and the pier receded in the dusk.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Shall we have any difficulty in getting into Knollsea Bay?' said
      Mountclere.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not if the wind keeps where it is for another hour or two.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I fancy it is shifting to the east'ard,' said Sol.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain looked as if he had thought the same thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I hope I shall be able to get home to-night,' said a Knollsea woman. 'My
      little children be left alone. Your mis'ess is in a bad way, too-isn't
      she, skipper?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And you've got the doctor from Sandbourne aboard, to tend her?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then you'll be sure to put into Knollsea, if you can?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. Don't be alarmed, ma'am. We'll do what we can. But no one must
      boast.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The skipper's remark was the result of an observation that the wind had at
      last flown to the east, the single point of the compass whence it could
      affect Knollsea Bay. The result of this change was soon perceptible. About
      midway in their transit the land elbowed out to a bold chalk promontory;
      beyond this stretched a vertical wall of the same cliff, in a line
      parallel with their course. In fair weather it was possible and customary
      to steer close along under this hoary facade for the distance of a mile,
      there being six fathoms of water within a few boats' lengths of the
      precipice. But it was an ugly spot at the best of times, landward no less
      than seaward, the cliff rounding off at the top in vegetation, like a
      forehead with low-grown hair, no defined edge being provided as a warning
      to unwary pedestrians on the downs above.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the wind sprung up stronger, white clots could be discerned at the
      water level of the cliff, rising and falling against the black band of
      shaggy weed that formed a sort of skirting to the base of the wall. They
      were the first-fruits of the new east blast, which shaved the face of the
      cliff like a razor-gatherings of foam in the shape of heads, shoulders,
      and arms of snowy whiteness, apparently struggling to rise from the deeps,
      and ever sinking back to their old levels again. They reminded an observer
      of a drowning scene in a picture of the Deluge. At some points the face of
      rock was hollowed into gaping caverns, and the water began to thunder into
      these with a leap that was only topped by the rebound seaward again. The
      vessel's head was kept a little further to sea, but beyond that everything
      went on as usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      The precipice was still in view, and before it several huge columns of
      rock appeared, detached from the mass behind. Two of these were
      particularly noticeable in the grey air-one vertical, stout and square;
      the other slender and tapering. They were individualized as husband and
      wife by the coast men. The waves leapt up their sides like a pack of
      hounds; this, however, though fearful in its boisterousness, was nothing
      to the terrible games that sometimes went on round the knees of those
      giants in stone. Yet it was sufficient to cause the course of the frail
      steamboat to be altered yet a little more-from south-west-by-south to
      south-by-west-to give the breakers a still wider berth.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I wish we had gone by land, sir; 'twould have been surer play,' said Sol
      to Mountclere, a cat-and-dog friendship having arisen between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' said Mountclere. 'Knollsea is an abominable place to get into with
      an east wind blowing, they say.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Another circumstance conspired to make their landing more difficult, which
      Mountclere knew nothing of. With the wind easterly, the highest sea
      prevailed in Knollsea Bay from the slackening of flood-tide to the first
      hour of ebb. At that time the water outside stood without a current, and
      ridges and hollows chased each other towards the beach unchecked. When the
      tide was setting strong up or down Channel its flow across the mouth of
      the bay thrust aside, to some extent, the landward plunge of the waves.
    </p>
    <p>
      We glance for a moment at the state of affairs on the land they were
      nearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the time of year to know the truth about the inner nature and
      character of Knollsea; for to see Knollsea smiling to the summer sun was
      to see a courtier before a king; Knollsea was not to be known by such
      simple means. The half-dozen detached villas used as lodging-houses in the
      summer, standing aloof from the cots of the permanent race, rose in the
      dusk of this gusty evening, empty, silent, damp, and dark as tombs. The
      gravel walks leading to them were invaded by leaves and tufts of grass. As
      the darkness thickened the wind increased, and each blast raked the iron
      railings before the houses till they hummed as if in a song of derision.
      Certainly it seemed absurd at this time of year that human beings should
      expect comfort in a spot capable of such moods as these.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, one of the houses looked cheerful, and that was the dwelling to
      which Ethelberta had gone. Its gay external colours might as well have
      been black for anything that could be seen of them now, but an unblinded
      window revealed inside it a room bright and warm. It was illuminated by
      firelight only. Within, Ethelberta appeared against the curtains, close to
      the glass. She was watching through a binocular a faint light which had
      become visible in the direction of the bluff far away over the bay.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Here is the Spruce at last, I think,' she said to her sister, who was by
      the fire. 'I hope they will be able to land the things I have ordered.
      They are on board I know.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The wind continued to rise till at length something from the lungs of the
      gale alighted like a feather upon the pane, and remained there sticking.
      Seeing the substance, Ethelberta opened the window to secure it. The fire
      roared and the pictures kicked the walls; she closed the sash, and brought
      to the light a crisp fragment of foam.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How suddenly the sea must have risen,' said Picotee.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant entered the room. 'Please, mis'ess says she is afraid you
      won't have your things to-night, 'm. They say the steamer can't land, and
      mis'ess wants to know if she can do anything?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is of no consequence,' said Ethelberta. 'They will come some time,
      unless they go to the bottom.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl left the room. 'Shall we go down to the shore and see what the
      night is like?' said Ethelberta. 'This is the last opportunity I shall
      have.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is it right for us to go, considering you are to be married to-morrow?'
      said Picotee, who had small affection for nature in this mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her sister laughed. 'Let us put on our cloaks-nobody will know us. I am
      sorry to leave this grim and primitive place, even for Enckworth Court.'
    </p>
    <p>
      They wrapped themselves up, and descended the hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      On drawing near the battling line of breakers which marked the meeting of
      sea and land they could perceive within the nearly invisible horizon an
      equilateral triangle of lights. It was formed of three stars, a red on the
      one side, a green on the other, and a white on the summit. This, composed
      of mast-head and side lamps, was all that was visible of the Spruce, which
      now faced end-on about half-a-mile distant, and was still nearing the
      pier. The girls went further, and stood on the foreshore, listening to the
      din. Seaward appeared nothing distinct save a black horizontal band
      embodying itself out of the grey water, strengthening its blackness, and
      enlarging till it looked like a nearing wall. It was the concave face of a
      coming wave. On its summit a white edging arose with the aspect of a lace
      frill; it broadened, and fell over the front with a terrible concussion.
      Then all before them was a sheet of whiteness, which spread with amazing
      rapidity, till they found themselves standing in the midst of it, as in a
      field of snow. Both felt an insidious chill encircling their ankles, and
      they rapidly ran up the beach.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You girls, come away there, or you'll be washed off: what need have ye
      for going so near?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta recognized the stentorian voice as that of Captain Flower, who,
      with a party of boatmen, was discovered to be standing near, under the
      shelter of a wall. He did not know them in the gloom, and they took care
      that he should not. They retreated further up the beach, when the hissing
      fleece of froth slid again down the shingle, dragging the pebbles under it
      with a rattle as of a beast gnawing bones.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spot whereon the men stood was called 'Down-under-wall;' it was a nook
      commanding a full view of the bay, and hither the nautical portion of the
      village unconsciously gravitated on windy afternoons and nights, to
      discuss past disasters in the reticent spirit induced by a sense that they
      might at any moment be repeated. The stranger who should walk the shore on
      roaring and sobbing November eves when there was not light sufficient to
      guide his footsteps, and muse on the absoluteness of the solitude, would
      be surprised by a smart 'Good-night' being returned from this corner in
      company with the echo of his tread. In summer the six or eight perennial
      figures stood on the breezy side of the wall-in winter and in rain to
      leeward; but no weather was known to dislodge them.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I had no sooner come ashore than the wind began to fly round,' said the
      previous speaker; 'and it must have been about the time they were off
      Old-Harry Point. "She'll put back for certain," I said; and I had no more
      thought o' seeing her than John's set-net that was carried round the point
      o' Monday.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Poor feller: his wife being in such a state makes him anxious to land if
      'a can: that's what 'tis, plain enough.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why that?' said Flower.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The doctor's aboard, 'a believe: "I'll have the most understanding man in
      Sandbourne, cost me little or much," he said.'
    </p>
    <p>
      ''Tis all over and she's better,' said the other. 'I called half-an-hour
      afore dark.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Flower, being an experienced man, knew how the judgment of a ship's master
      was liable to be warped by family anxieties, many instances of the same
      having occurred in the history of navigation. He felt uneasy, for he knew
      the deceit and guile of this bay far better than did the master of the
      Spruce, who, till within a few recent months, had been a stranger to the
      place. Indeed, it was the bay which had made Flower what he was, instead
      of a man in thriving retirement. The two great ventures of his life had
      been blown ashore and broken up within that very semicircle. The sturdy
      sailor now stood with his eyes fixed on the triangle of lights which
      showed that the steamer had not relinquished her intention of bringing up
      inside the pier if possible; his right hand was in his pocket, where it
      played with a large key which lay there. It was the key of the lifeboat
      shed, and Flower was coxswain. His musing was on the possibility of a use
      for it this night.
    </p>
    <p>
      It appeared that the captain of the Spruce was aiming to pass in under the
      lee of the pier; but a strong current of four or five knots was running
      between the piles, drifting the steamer away at every attempt as soon as
      she slowed. To come in on the other side was dangerous, the hull of the
      vessel being likely to crash against and overthrow the fragile erection,
      with damage to herself also. Flower, who had disappeared for a few
      minutes, now came back.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is just possible I can make 'em hear with the trumpet, now they be to
      leeward,' he said, and proceeded with two or three others to grope his way
      out upon the pier, which consisted simply of a row of rotten piles covered
      with rotten planking, no balustrade of any kind existing to keep the
      unwary from tumbling off. At the water level the piles were eaten away by
      the action of the sea to about the size of a man's wrist, and at every
      fresh influx the whole structure trembled like a spider's web. In this lay
      the danger of making fast, for a strong pull from a headfast rope might
      drag the erection completely over. Flower arrived at the end, where a
      lantern hung.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Spruce ahoy!' he blared through the speaking trumpet two or three times.
    </p>
    <p>
      There seemed to be a reply of some sort from the steamer.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Tuesday's gale hev loosened the pier, Cap'n Ounce; the bollards be too
      weak to make fast to: must land in boats if ye will land, but dangerous;
      yer wife is out of danger, and 'tis a boy-y-y-y!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta and Picotee were at this time standing on the beach a hundred
      and fifty yards off. Whether or not the master of the steamer received the
      information volunteered by Flower, the two girls saw the triangle of lamps
      get narrow at its base, reduce themselves to two in a vertical line, then
      to one, then to darkness. The Spruce had turned her head from Knollsea.
    </p>
    <p>
      'They have gone back, and I shall not have my wedding things after all!'
      said Ethelberta. 'Well, I must do without them.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You see, 'twas best to play sure,' said Flower to his comrades, in a tone
      of complacency. 'They might have been able to do it, but 'twas risky. The
      shop-folk be out of stock, I hear, and the visiting lady up the hill is
      terribly in want of clothes, so 'tis said. But what's that? Ounce ought to
      have put back afore.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the lantern which hung at the end of the jetty was taken down, and
      the darkness enfolded all around from view. The bay became nothing but a
      voice, the foam an occasional touch upon the face, the Spruce an
      imagination, the pier a memory. Everything lessened upon the senses but
      one; that was the wind. It mauled their persons like a hand, and caused
      every scrap of their raiment to tug westward. To stand with the face to
      sea brought semi-suffocation, from the intense pressure of air.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boatmen retired to their position under the wall, to lounge again in
      silence. Conversation was not considered necessary: their sense of each
      other's presence formed a kind of conversation. Meanwhile Picotee and
      Ethelberta went up the hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      'If your wedding were going to be a public one, what a misfortune this
      delay of the packages would be,' said Picotee.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' replied the elder.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I think the bracelet the prettiest of all the presents he brought
      to-day-do you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is the most valuable.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lord Mountclere is very kind, is he not? I like him a great deal better
      than I did-do you, Berta?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, very much better,' said Ethelberta, warming a little. 'If he were
      not so suspicious at odd moments I should like him exceedingly. But I must
      cure him of that by a regular course of treatment, and then he'll be very
      nice.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'For an old man. He likes you better than any young man would take the
      trouble to do. I wish somebody else were old too.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He will be some day.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, but-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never mind: time will straighten many crooked things.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you think Lord Mountclere has reached home by this time?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I should think so: though I believe he had to call at the parsonage
      before leaving Knollsea.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Had he? What for?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, of course somebody must-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O yes. Do you think anybody in Knollsea knows it is going to be except us
      and the parson?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I suppose the clerk knows.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I wonder if a lord has ever been married so privately before.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Frequently: when he marries far beneath him, as in this case. But even if
      I could have had it, I should not have liked a showy wedding. I have had
      no experience as a bride except in the private form of the ceremony.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Berta, I am sometimes uneasy about you even now and I want to ask you one
      thing, if I may. Are you doing this for my sake? Would you have married
      Mr. Julian if it had not been for me?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is difficult to say exactly. It is possible that if I had had no
      relations at all, I might have married him. And I might not.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't intend to marry.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'In that case you will live with me at Enckworth. However, we will leave
      such details till the ground-work is confirmed. When we get indoors will
      you see if the boxes have been properly corded, and are quite ready to be
      sent for? Then come in and sit by the fire, and I'll sing some songs to
      you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sad ones, you mean.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, they shall not be sad.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Perhaps they may be the last you will ever sing to me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'They may be. Such a thing has occurred.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But we will not think so. We'll suppose you are to sing many to me yet.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. There's good sense in that, Picotee. In a world where the blind only
      are cheerful we should all do well to put out our eyes. There, I did not
      mean to get into this state: forgive me, Picotee. It is because I have had
      a thought-why I cannot tell-that as much as this man brings to me in rank
      and gifts he may take out of me in tears.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Berta!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But there's no reason in it-not any; for not in a single matter does what
      has been supply us with any certain ground for knowing what will be in the
      world. I have seen marriages where happiness might have been said to be
      ensured, and they have been all sadness afterwards; and I have seen those
      in which the prospect was black as night, and they have led on to a time
      of sweetness and comfort. And I have seen marriages neither joyful nor
      sorry, that have become either as accident forced them to become, the
      persons having no voice in it at all. Well, then, why should I be afraid
      to make a plunge when chance is as trustworthy as calculation?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If you don't like him well enough, don't have him, Berta. There's time
      enough to put it off even now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no. I would not upset a well-considered course on the haste of an
      impulse. Our will should withstand our misgivings. Now let us see if all
      has been packed, and then we'll sing.'
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening, while the wind was wheeling round and round the dwelling,
      and the calm eye of the lighthouse afar was the single speck perceptible
      of the outside world from the door of Ethelberta's temporary home, the
      music of songs mingled with the stroke of the wind across the iron
      railings, and was swept on in the general tide of the gale, and the noise
      of the rolling sea, till not the echo of a tone remained.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour before this singing, an old gentleman might have been seen to
      alight from a little one-horse brougham, and enter the door of Knollsea
      parsonage. He was bent upon obtaining an entrance to the vicar's study
      without giving his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it happened that the vicar's wife was sitting in the front room,
      making a pillow-case for the children's bed out of an old surplice which
      had been excommunicated the previous Easter; she heard the newcomer's
      voice through the partition, started, and went quickly to her husband, who
      was where he ought to have been, in his study. At her entry he looked up
      with an abstracted gaze, having been lost in meditation over a little
      schooner which he was attempting to rig for their youngest boy. At a word
      from his wife on the suspected name of the visitor, he resumed his earlier
      occupation of inserting a few strong sentences, full of the observation of
      maturer life, between the lines of a sermon written during his first years
      of ordination, in order to make it available for the coming Sunday. His
      wife then vanished with the little ship in her hand, and the visitor
      appeared. A talk went on in low tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a ten minutes' stay he departed as secretly as he had come. His
      errand was the cause of much whispered discussion between the vicar and
      his wife during the evening, but nothing was said concerning it to the
      outside world.

    <h2>
      44. SANDBOURNE-A LONELY HEATH-THE 'RED LION'-THE HIGHWAY
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was half-past eleven before the Spruce, with Mountclere and Sol
      Chickerel on board, had steamed back again to Sandbourne. The direction
      and increase of the wind had made it necessary to keep the vessel still
      further to sea on their return than in going, that they might clear
      without risk the windy, sousing, thwacking, basting, scourging Jack Ketch
      of a corner called Old-Harry Point, which lay about halfway along their
      track, and stood, with its detached posts and stumps of white rock, like a
      skeleton's lower jaw, grinning at British navigation. Here strong currents
      and cross currents were beginning to interweave their scrolls and meshes,
      the water rising behind them in tumultuous heaps, and slamming against the
      fronts and angles of cliff, whence it flew into the air like clouds of
      flour. Who could now believe that this roaring abode of chaos smiled in
      the sun as gently as an infant during the summer days not long gone by,
      every pinnacle, crag, and cave returning a doubled image across the glassy
      sea?
    </p>
    <p>
      They were now again at Sandbourne, a point in their journey reached more
      than four hours ago. It became necessary to consider anew how to
      accomplish the difficult remainder. The wind was not blowing much beyond
      what seamen call half a gale, but there had been enough unpleasantness
      afloat to make landsmen glad to get ashore, and this dissipated in a
      slight measure their vexation at having failed in their purpose. Still,
      Mountclere loudly cursed their confidence in that treacherously short
      route, and Sol abused the unknown Sandbourne man who had brought the news
      of the steamer's arrival to them at the junction. The only course left
      open to them now, short of giving up the undertaking, was to go by the
      road along the shore, which, curving round the various little creeks and
      inland seas between their present position and Knollsea, was of no less
      length than thirty miles. There was no train back to the junction till the
      next morning, and Sol's proposition that they should drive thither in hope
      of meeting the mail-train, was overruled by Mountclere.
    </p>
    <p>
      'We will have nothing more to do with chance,' he said. 'We may miss the
      train, and then we shall have gone out of the way for nothing. More than
      that, the down mail does not stop till it gets several miles beyond the
      nearest station for Knollsea; so it is hopeless.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If there had only been a telegraph to the confounded place!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Telegraph-we might as well telegraph to the devil as to an old booby and
      a damned scheming young widow. I very much question if we shall do
      anything in the matter, even if we get there. But I suppose we had better
      go on now?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You can do as you like. I shall go on, if I have to walk every step o't.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's not necessary. I think the best posting-house at this end of the
      town is Tempett's-we must knock them up at once. Which will you do-attempt
      supper here, or break the back of our journey first, and get on to
      Anglebury? We may rest an hour or two there, unless you feel really in
      want of a meal.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No. I'll leave eating to merrier men, who have no sister in the hands of
      a cursed old Vandal.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very well,' said Mountclere. 'We'll go on at once.'
    </p>
    <p>
      An additional half-hour elapsed before they were fairly started, the
      lateness and abruptness of their arrival causing delay in getting a
      conveyance ready: the tempestuous night had apparently driven the whole
      town, gentle and simple, early to their beds. And when at length the
      travellers were on their way the aspect of the weather grew yet more
      forbidding. The rain came down unmercifully, the booming wind caught it,
      bore it across the plain, whizzed it against the carriage like a sower
      sowing his seed. It was precisely such weather, and almost at the same
      season, as when Picotee traversed the same moor, stricken with her great
      disappointment at not meeting Christopher Julian.
    </p>
    <p>
      Further on for several miles the drive lay through an open heath, dotted
      occasionally with fir plantations, the trees of which told the tale of
      their species without help from outline or colour; they spoke in those
      melancholy moans and sobs which give to their sound a solemn sadness
      surpassing even that of the sea. From each carriage-lamp the long rays
      stretched like feelers into the air, and somewhat cheered the way, until
      the insidious damp that pervaded all things above, around, and underneath,
      overpowered one of them, and rendered every attempt to rekindle it
      ineffectual. Even had the two men's dislike to each other's society been
      less, the general din of the night would have prevented much talking; as
      it was, they sat in a rigid reticence that was almost a third personality.
      The roads were laid hereabouts with a light sandy gravel, which, though
      not clogging, was soft and friable. It speedily became saturated, and the
      wheels ground heavily and deeply into its substance.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, after crossing from ten to twelve miles of these eternal heaths
      under the eternally drumming storm, they could discern eyelets of light
      winking to them in the distance from under a nebulous brow of pale haze.
      They were looking on the little town of Havenpool. Soon after this
      cross-roads were reached, one of which, at right angles to their present
      direction, led down on the left to that place. Here the man stopped, and
      informed them that the horses would be able to go but a mile or two
      further.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very well, we must have others that can,' said Mountclere. 'Does our way
      lie through the town?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, sir-unless we go there to change horses, which I thought to do. The
      direct road is straight on. Havenpool lies about three miles down there on
      the left. But the water is over the road, and we had better go round. We
      shall come to no place for two or three miles, and then only to Flychett.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What's Flychett like?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A trumpery small bit of a village.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Still, I think we had better push on,' said Sol. 'I am against running
      the risk of finding the way flooded about Havenpool.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'So am I,' returned Mountclere.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I know a wheelwright in Flychett,' continued Sol, 'and he keeps a
      beer-house, and owns two horses. We could hire them, and have a bit of
      sommat in the shape of victuals, and then get on to Anglebury. Perhaps the
      rain may hold up by that time. Anything's better than going out of our
      way.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. And the horses can last out to that place,' said Mountclere. 'Up and
      on again, my man.'
    </p>
    <p>
      On they went towards Flychett. Still the everlasting heath, the black
      hills bulging against the sky, the barrows upon their round summits like
      warts on a swarthy skin. The storm blew huskily over bushes of heather and
      furze that it was unable materially to disturb, and the travellers
      proceeded as before. But the horses were now far from fresh, and the time
      spent in reaching the next village was quite half as long as that taken up
      by the previous heavy portion of the drive. When they entered Flychett it
      was about three.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now, where's the inn?' said Mountclere, yawning.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Just on the knap,' Sol answered. ''Tis a little small place, and we must
      do as well as we can.'
    </p>
    <p>
      They pulled up before a cottage, upon the whitewashed front of which could
      be seen a square board representing the sign. After an infinite labour of
      rapping and shouting, a casement opened overhead, and a woman's voice
      inquired what was the matter. Sol explained, when she told them that the
      horses were away from home.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now we must wait till these are rested,' growled Mountclere. 'A pretty
      muddle!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It cannot be helped,' answered Sol; and he asked the woman to open the
      door. She replied that her husband was away with the horses and van, and
      that they could not come in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sol was known to her, and he mentioned his name; but the woman only began
      to abuse him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Come, publican, you'd better let us in, or we'll have the law for't,'
      rejoined Sol, with more spirit. 'You don't dare to keep nobility waiting
      like this.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nobility!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'My mate hev the title of Honourable, whether or no; so let's have none of
      your slack,' said Sol.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't be a fool, young chopstick,' exclaimed Mountclere. 'Get the door
      opened.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will-in my own way,' said Sol testily. 'You mustn't mind my trading
      upon your quality, as 'tis a case of necessity. This is a woman nothing
      will bring to reason but an appeal to the higher powers. If every man of
      title was as useful as you are to-night, sir, I'd never call them lumber
      again as long as I live.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How singular!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'There's never a bit of rubbish that won't come in use if you keep it
      seven years.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If my utility depends upon keeping you company, may I go to h&mdash;- for
      lacking every atom of the virtue.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hear, hear! But it hardly is becoming in me to answer up to a man so much
      older than I, or I could say more. Suppose we draw a line here for the
      present, sir, and get indoors?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do what you will, in Heaven's name.'
    </p>
    <p>
      A few more words to the woman resulted in her agreeing to admit them if
      they would attend to themselves afterwards. This Sol promised, and the key
      of the door was let down to them from the bedroom window by a string. When
      they had entered, Sol, who knew the house well, busied himself in lighting
      a fire, the driver going off with a lantern to the stable, where he found
      standing-room for the two horses. Mountclere walked up and down the
      kitchen, mumbling words of disgust at the situation, the few of this kind
      that he let out being just enough to show what a fearfully large number he
      kept in.
    </p>
    <p>
      'A-calling up people at this time of morning!' the woman occasionally
      exclaimed down the stairs. 'But folks show no mercy upon their flesh and
      blood-not one bit or mite.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now never be stomachy, my good soul,' cried Sol from the fireplace, where
      he stood blowing the fire with his breath. 'Only tell me where the
      victuals bide, and I'll do all the cooking. We'll pay like
      princes-especially my mate.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'There's but little in house,' said the sleepy woman from her bedroom.
      'There's pig's fry, a side of bacon, a conger eel, and pickled onions.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Conger eel?' said Sol to Mountclere.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, thank you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Pig's fry?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, thank you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, then, tell me where the bacon is,' shouted Sol to the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You must find it,' came again down the stairs. ''Tis somewhere up in
      chimley, but in which part I can't mind. Really I don't know whether I be
      upon my head or my heels, and my brain is all in a spin, wi' being rafted
      up in such a larry!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Bide where you be, there's a dear,' said Sol. 'We'll do it all. Just tell
      us where the tea-caddy is, and the gridiron, and then you can go to sleep
      again.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman appeared to take his advice, for she gave the information, and
      silence soon reigned upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      When one piece of bacon had been with difficulty cooked over the newly-lit
      fire, Sol said to Mountclere, with the rasher on his fork: 'Now look here,
      sir, I think while I am making the tea, you ought to go on griddling some
      more of these, as you haven't done nothing at all?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I do the paying. . . . Well, give me the bacon.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And when you have done yours, I'll cook the man's, as the poor feller's
      hungry, I make no doubt.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mountclere, fork in hand, then began with his rasher, tossing it about the
      gridiron in masterly style, Sol attending to the tea. He was attracted
      from this occupation by a brilliant flame up the chimney, Mountclere
      exclaiming, 'Now the cursed thing is on fire!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Blow it out-hard-that's it! Well now, sir, do you come and begin upon
      mine, as you must be hungry. I'll finish the griddling. Ought we to mind
      the man sitting down in our company, as there's no other room for him? I
      hear him coming in.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no-not at all. Put him over at that table.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And I'll join him. You can sit here by yourself, sir.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The meal was despatched, and the coachman again retired, promising to have
      the horses ready in about an hour and a half. Sol and Mountclere made
      themselves comfortable upon either side of the fireplace, since there was
      no remedy for the delay: after sitting in silence awhile, they nodded and
      slept.
    </p>
    <p>
      How long they would have remained thus, in consequence of their fatigues,
      there is no telling, had not the mistress of the cottage descended the
      stairs about two hours later, after peeping down upon them at intervals of
      five minutes during their sleep, lest they should leave without her
      knowledge. It was six o'clock, and Sol went out for the man, whom he found
      snoring in the hay-loft. There was now real necessity for haste, and in
      ten minutes they were again on their way.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Day dawned upon the 'Red Lion' inn at Anglebury with a timid and watery
      eye. From the shadowy archway came a shining lantern, which was seen to be
      dangling from the hand of a little bow-legged old man-the hostler, John.
      Having reached the front, he looked around to measure the daylight, opened
      the lantern, and extinguished it by a pinch of his fingers. He paused for
      a moment to have the customary word or two with his neighbour the milkman,
      who usually appeared at this point at this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It sounds like the whistle of the morning train,' the milkman said as he
      drew near, a scream from the further end of the town reaching their ears.
      'Well, I hope, now the wind's in that quarter, we shall ha'e a little more
      fine weather-hey, hostler?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What be ye a talking o'?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Can hear the whistle plain, I say.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O ay. I suppose you do. But faith, 'tis a poor fist I can make at hearing
      anything. There, I could have told all the same that the wind was in the
      east, even if I had not seed poor Thomas Tribble's smoke blowing across
      the little orchard. Joints be a true weathercock enough when past
      three-score. These easterly rains, when they do come, which is not often,
      come wi' might enough to squail a man into his grave.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, we must look for it, hostler. . . . Why, what mighty ekkypage is
      this, come to town at such a purbHANDlinking time of day?'
    </p>
    <p>
      ''Tis what time only can tell-though 'twill not be long first,' the
      hostler replied, as the driver of the pair of horses and carriage
      containing Sol and Mountclere slackened pace, and drew rein before the
      inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fresh horses were immediately called for, and while they were being put in
      the two travellers walked up and down.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is now a quarter to seven o'clock,' said Mountclere; 'and the question
      arises, shall I go on to Knollsea, or branch off at Corvsgate Castle for
      Enckworth? I think the best plan will be to drive first to Enckworth, set
      me down, and then get him to take you on at once to Knollsea. What do you
      say?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'When shall I reach Knollsea by that arrangement?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'By half-past eight o'clock. We shall be at Enckworth before eight, which
      is excellent time.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very well, sir, I agree to that,' said Sol, feeling that as soon as one
      of the two birds had been caught, the other could not mate without their
      knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The carriage and horses being again ready, away they drove at once, both
      having by this time grown too restless to spend in Anglebury a minute more
      than was necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hostler and his lad had taken the jaded Sandbourne horses to the
      stable, rubbed them down, and fed them, when another noise was heard
      outside the yard; the omnibus had returned from meeting the train.
      Relinquishing the horses to the small stable-lad, the old hostler again
      looked out from the arch.
    </p>
    <p>
      A young man had stepped from the omnibus, and he came forward. 'I want a
      conveyance of some sort to take me to Knollsea, at once. Can you get a
      horse harnessed in five minutes?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll make shift to do what I can master, not promising about the minutes.
      The truest man can say no more. Won't ye step into the bar, sir, and give
      your order? I'll let ye know as soon as 'tis ready.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher turned into a room smelling strongly of the night before, and
      stood by the newly-kindled fire to wait. He had just come in haste from
      Melchester. The upshot of his excitement about the wedding, which, as the
      possible hour of its solemnization drew near, had increased till it bore
      him on like a wind, was this unpremeditated journey. Lying awake the
      previous night, the hangings of his bed pulsing to every beat of his
      heart, he decided that there was one last and great service which it
      behoved him, as an honest man and friend, to say nothing of lover, to
      render to Ethelberta at this juncture. It was to ask her by some means
      whether or not she had engaged with open eyes to marry Lord Mountclere;
      and if not, to give her a word or two of enlightenment. That done, she
      might be left to take care of herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      His plan was to obtain an interview with Picotee, and learn from her
      accurately the state of things. Should he, by any possibility, be mistaken
      in his belief as to the contracting parties, a knowledge of the mistake
      would be cheaply purchased by the journey. Should he not, he would send up
      to Ethelberta the strong note of expostulation which was already written,
      and waiting in his pocket. To intrude upon her at such a time was
      unseemly; and to despatch a letter by a messenger before evidence of its
      necessity had been received was most undesirable. The whole proceeding at
      best was clumsy; yet earnestness is mostly clumsy; and how could he let
      the event pass without a protest? Before daylight on that autumn morning
      he had risen, told Faith of his intention, and started off.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the vehicle was ready, Christopher hastened to the door and
      stepped up. The little stable-boy led the horse a few paces on the way
      before relinquishing his hold; at the same moment a respectably dressed
      man on foot, with a small black bag in his hand, came up from the opposite
      direction, along the street leading from the railway. He was a thin,
      elderly man, with grey hair; that a great anxiety pervaded him was as
      plainly visible as were his features. Without entering the inn, he came up
      at once to old John.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Have you anything going to Knollsea this morning that I can get a lift
      in?' said the pedestrian-no other than Ethelberta's father.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nothing empty, that I know of.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Or carrier?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A matter of fifteen shillings, then, I suppose?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes-no doubt. But yond there's a young man just now starting; he might
      not take it ill if ye were to ask him for a seat, and go halves in the
      hire of the trap. Shall I call out?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, do.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The hostler bawled to the stable-boy, who put the question to Christopher.
      There was room for two in the dogcart, and Julian had no objection to save
      the shillings of a fellow-traveller who was evidently not rich. When
      Chickerel mounted to his seat, Christopher paused to look at him as we
      pause in some enactment that seems to have been already before us in a
      dream long ago. Ethelberta's face was there, as the landscape is in the
      map, the romance in the history, the aim in the deed: denuded, rayless,
      and sorry, but discernible.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the moment, however, this did not occur to Julian. He took the whip,
      the boy loosed his hold upon the horse, and they proceeded on their way.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What slap-dash jinks may there be going on at Knollsea, then, my sonny?'
      said the hostler to the lad, as the dogcart and the backs of the two men
      diminished on the road. 'You be a Knollsea boy: have anything reached your
      young ears about what's in the wind there, David Straw?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, nothing: except that 'tis going to be Christmas day in five weeks:
      and then a hide-bound bull is going to be killed if he don't die afore the
      time, and gi'ed away by my lord in three-pound junks, as a reward to good
      people who never curse and sing bad songs, except when they be drunk;
      mother says perhaps she will have some, and 'tis excellent if well stewed,
      mother says.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A very fair chronicle for a boy to give, but not what I asked for. When
      you try to answer a old man's question, always bear in mind what it was
      that old man asked. A hide-bound bull is good when well stewed, I make no
      doubt-for they who like it; but that's not it. What I said was, do you
      know why three fokes, a rich man, a middling man, and a poor man, should
      want horses for Knollsea afore seven o'clock in the morning on a
      bHANDlinking day in Fall, when everything is as wet as a dishclout,
      whereas that's more than often happens in fine summer weather?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No-I don't know, John hostler.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then go home and tell your mother that ye be no wide-awake boy, and that
      old John, who went to school with her father afore she was born or thought
      o', says so. . . . Chok' it all, why should I think there's sommat going
      on at Knollsea? Honest travelling have been so rascally abused since I was
      a boy in pinners, by tribes of nobodies tearing from one end of the
      country to t'other, to see the sun go down in salt water, or the moon play
      jack-lantern behind some rotten tower or other, that, upon my song, when
      life and death's in the wind there's no telling the difference!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I like their sixpences ever so much.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Young sonny, don't you answer up to me when you baint in the
      story-stopping my words in that fashion. I won't have it, David. Now up in
      the tallet with ye, there's a good boy, and down with another lock or two
      of hay-as fast as you can do it for me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy vanished under the archway, and the hostler followed at his heels.
      Meanwhile the carriage bearing Mr. Mountclere and Sol was speeding on its
      way to Enckworth. When they reached the spot at which the road forked into
      two, they left the Knollsea route, and keeping thence under the hills for
      the distance of five or six miles, drove into Lord Mountclere's park. In
      ten minutes the house was before them, framed in by dripping trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mountclere jumped out, and entered without ceremony. Sol, being anxious to
      know if Lord Mountclere was there, ordered the coachman to wait a few
      moments. It was now nearly eight o'clock, and the smoke which ascended
      from the newly-lit fires of the Court painted soft blue tints upon the
      brown and golden leaves of lofty boughs adjoining.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, Ethelberta!' said Sol, as he regarded the fair prospect.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gravel of the drive had been washed clean and smooth by the night's
      rain, but there were fresh wheelmarks other than their own upon the track.
      Yet the mansion seemed scarcely awake, and stillness reigned everywhere
      around.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not more than three or four minutes had passed when the door was opened
      for Mountclere, and he came hastily from the doorsteps.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I must go on with you,' he said, getting into the vehicle. 'He's gone.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Where-to Knollsea?' said Sol.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' said Mountclere. 'Now, go ahead to Knollsea!' he shouted to the
      man. 'To think I should be fooled like this! I had no idea that he would
      be leaving so soon! We might perhaps have been here an hour earlier by
      hard striving. But who was to dream that he would arrange to leave it at
      such an unearthly time of the morning at this dark season of the year?
      Drive-drive!' he called again out of the window, and the pace was
      increased.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have come two or three miles out of my way on account of you,' said Sol
      sullenly. 'And all this time lost. I don't see why you wanted to come here
      at all. I knew it would be a waste of time.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Damn it all, man,' said Mountclere; 'it is no use for you to be angry
      with me!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I think it is, for 'tis you have brought me into this muddle,' said Sol,
      in no sweeter tone. 'Ha, ha! Upon my life I should be inclined to laugh,
      if I were not so much inclined to do the other thing, at Berta's trick of
      trying to make close family allies of such a cantankerous pair as you and
      I! So much of one mind as we be, so alike in our ways of living, so close
      connected in our callings and principles, so matched in manners and
      customs! 'twould be a thousand pities to part us-hey, Mr. Mountclere!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mountclere faintly laughed with the same hideous merriment at the same
      idea, and then both remained in a withering silence, meant to express the
      utter contempt of each for the other, both in family and in person. They
      passed the Lodge, and again swept into the highroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Drive on!' said Mountclere, putting his head again out of the window, and
      shouting to the man. 'Drive like the devil!' he roared again a few minutes
      afterwards, in fuming dissatisfaction with their rate of progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Baint I doing of it?' said the driver, turning angrily round. 'I ain't
      going to ruin my governor's horses for strangers who won't pay double for
      'em-not I. I am driving as fast as I can. If other folks get in the way
      with their traps I suppose I must drive round 'em, sir?'
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a slight crash.
    </p>
    <p>
      'There!' continued the coachman. 'That's what comes of my turning round!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Sol looked out on the other side, and found that the forewheel of their
      carriage had become locked in the wheel of a dogcart they had overtaken,
      the road here being very narrow. Their coachman, who knew he was to blame
      for this mishap, felt the advantage of taking time by the forelock in a
      case of accusation, and began swearing at his victim as if he were the
      sinner. Sol jumped out, and looking up at the occupants of the other
      conveyance, saw against the sky the back elevation of his father and
      Christopher Julian, sitting upon a little seat which they overhung, like
      two big puddings upon a small dish.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Father-what, you going?' said Sol. 'Is it about Berta that you've come?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, I got your letter,' said Chickerel, 'and I felt I should like to
      come-that I ought to come, to save her from what she'll regret. Luckily,
      this gentleman, a stranger to me, has given me a lift from Anglebury, or I
      must have hired.' He pointed to Christopher.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But he's Mr. Julian!' said Sol.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are Mrs. Petherwin's father?-I have travelled in your company without
      knowing it!' exclaimed Christopher, feeling and looking both astonished
      and puzzled. At first, it had appeared to him that, in direct antagonism
      to his own purpose, her friends were favouring Ethelberta's wedding; but
      it was evidently otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, that's father,' said Sol. 'Father, this is Mr. Julian. Mr. Julian,
      this gentleman here is Lord Mountclere's brother-and, to cut the story
      short, we all wish to stop the wedding.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then let us get on, in Heaven's name!' said Mountclere. 'You are the
      lady's father?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am,' said Chickerel.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then you had better come into this carriage. We shall go faster than the
      dogcart. Now, driver, are the wheels right again?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Chickerel hastily entered with Mountclere, Sol joined them, and they sped
      on. Christopher drove close in their rear, not quite certain whether he
      did well in going further, now that there were plenty of people to attend
      to the business, but anxious to see the end. The other three sat in
      silence, with their eyes upon their knees, though the clouds were
      dispersing, and the morning grew bright. In about twenty minutes the
      square unembattled tower of Knollsea Church appeared below them in the
      vale, its summit just touching the distant line of sea upon sky. The
      element by which they had been victimized on the previous evening now
      smiled falsely to the low morning sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      They descended the road to the village at a little more mannerly pace than
      that of the earlier journey, and saw the rays glance upon the hands of the
      church clock, which marked five-and-twenty minutes to nine.

    <h2>
      45. KNOLLSEA-THE ROAD THENCE-ENCKWORTH
    </h2>
    <p>
      All eyes were directed to the church-gate, as the travellers descended the
      hill. No wedding carriages were there, no favours, no slatternly group of
      women brimming with interest, no aged pauper on two sticks, who comes
      because he has nothing else to do till dying time, no nameless female
      passing by on the other side with a laugh of indifference, no ringers
      taking off their coats as they vanish up a turret, no hobbledehoys on
      tiptoe outside the chancel windows-in short, none whatever of the
      customary accessories of a country wedding was anywhere visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Thank God!' said Chickerel.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Wait till you know he deserves it,' said Mountclere.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nothing's done yet between them.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is not likely that anything is done at this time of day. But I have
      decided to go to the church first. You will probably go to your relative's
      house at once?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Sol looked to his father for a reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, I too shall go to the church first, just to assure myself,' said
      Chickerel. 'I shall then go on to Mrs Petherwin's.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The carriage was stopped at the corner of a steep incline leading down to
      the edifice. Mountclere and Chickerel alighted and walked on towards the
      gates, Sol remaining in his place. Christopher was some way off,
      descending the hill on foot, having halted to leave his horse and trap at
      a small inn at the entrance to the village.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Chickerel and Mountclere reached the churchyard gate they found it
      slightly open. The church-door beyond it was also open, but nobody was
      near the spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      'We have arrived not a minute too soon, however,' said Mountclere.
      'Preparations have apparently begun. It was to be an early wedding, no
      doubt.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Entering the building, they looked around; it was quite empty. Chickerel
      turned towards the chancel, his eye being attracted by a red
      kneeling-cushion, placed at about the middle of the altar-railing, as if
      for early use. Mountclere strode to the vestry, somewhat at a loss how to
      proceed in his difficult task of unearthing his brother, obtaining a
      private interview with him, and then, by the introduction of Sol and
      Chickerel, causing a general convulsion.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ha! here's somebody,' he said, observing a man in the vestry. He advanced
      with the intention of asking where Lord Mountclere was to be found.
      Chickerel came forward in the same direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Are you the parish clerk?' said Mountclere to the man, who was dressed up
      in his best clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I hev the honour of that calling,' the man replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two large books were lying before him on the vestry table, one of them
      being open. As the clerk spoke he looked slantingly on the page, as a
      person might do to discover if some writing were dry. Mountclere and
      Chickerel gazed on the same page. The book was the marriage-register.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Too late!' said Chickerel.
    </p>
    <p>
      There plainly enough stood the signatures of Lord Mountclere and
      Ethelberta. The viscount's was very black, and had not yet dried. Her
      strokes were firm, and comparatively thick for a woman's, though paled by
      juxtaposition with her husband's muddled characters. In the space for
      witnesses' names appeared in trembling lines as fine as silk the autograph
      of Picotee, the second name being that of a stranger, probably the clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, yes-we are too late, it seems,' said Mountclere coolly. 'Who could
      have thought they'd marry at eight!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Chickerel stood like a man baked hard and dry. Further than his first two
      words he could say nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      'They must have set about it early, upon my soul,' Mountclere continued.
      'When did the wedding take place?' he asked of the clerk sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It was over about five minutes before you came in,' replied that luminary
      pleasantly, as he played at an invisible game of pitch-and-toss with some
      half-sovereigns in his pocket. 'I received orders to have the church ready
      at five minutes to eight this morning, though I knew nothing about such a
      thing till bedtime last night. It was very private and plain, not that I
      should mind another such a one, sir;' and he secretly pitched and tossed
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Sol had found himself too restless to sit waiting in the
      carriage for more than a minute after the other two had left it. He
      stepped out at the same instant that Christopher came past, and together
      they too went on to the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Father, ought we not to go on at once to Ethelberta's, instead of
      waiting?' said Sol, on reaching the vestry, still in ignorance. ''Twas no
      use in coming here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No use at all,' said Chickerel, as if he had straw in his throat. 'Look
      at this. I would almost sooner have had it that in leaving this church I
      came from her grave-well, no, perhaps not that, but I fear it is a bad
      thing.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Sol then saw the names in the register, Christopher saw them, and the man
      closed the book. Christopher could not well command himself, and he
      retired.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I knew it. I always said that pride would lead Berta to marry an unworthy
      man, and so it has!' said Sol bitterly. 'What shall we do now? I'll see
      her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do no such thing, young man,' said Mountclere. 'The best course is to
      leave matters alone. They are married. If you are wise, you will try to
      think the match a good one, and be content to let her keep her position
      without inconveniencing her by your intrusions or complaints. It is
      possible that the satisfaction of her ambition will help her to endure any
      few surprises to her propriety that may occur. She is a clever young
      woman, and has played her cards adroitly. I only hope she may never repent
      of the game! A-hem. Good morning.' Saying this, Mountclere slightly bowed
      to his relations, and marched out of the church with dignity; but it was
      told afterwards by the coachman, who had no love for Mountclere, that when
      he stepped into the fly, and was as he believed unobserved, he was quite
      overcome with fatuous rage, his lips frothing like a mug of hot ale.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What an impertinent gentleman 'tis,' said Chickerel. 'As if we had tried
      for her to marry his brother!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He knows better than that,' said Sol. 'But he'll never believe that Berta
      didn't lay a trap for the old fellow. He thinks at this moment that Lord
      Mountclere has never been told of us and our belongings.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I wonder if she has deceived him in anything,' murmured Chickerel. 'I can
      hardly suppose it. But she is altogether beyond me. However, if she has
      misled him on any point she will suffer for it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You need not fear that, father. It isn't her way of working. Why couldn't
      she have known that when a title is to be had for the asking, the owner
      must be a shocking one indeed?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The title is well enough. Any poor scrubs in our place must be fools not
      to think the match a very rare and astonishing honour, as far as the
      position goes. But that my brave girl will be miserable is a part of the
      honour I can't stomach so well. If he had been any other lord in the
      kingdom, we might have been merry indeed. I believe he will ruin her
      happiness-yes, I do-not by any personal snubbing or rough conduct, but by
      other things, causing her to be despised; and that is a thing she can't
      endure.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She's not to be despised without a deal of trouble-we must remember that.
      And if he insults her by introducing new favourites, as they say he did
      his first wife, I'll call upon him and ask his meaning, and take her
      away.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nonsense-we shall never know what he does, or how she feels; she will
      never let out a word. However unhappy she may be, she will always deny
      it-that's the unfortunate part of such marriages.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'An old chap like that ought to leave young women alone, damn him!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The clerk came nearer. 'I am afraid I cannot allow bad words to be spoke
      in this sacred pile,' he said. 'As far as my personal self goes, I should
      have no objection to your cussing as much as you like, but as a official
      of the church my conscience won't allow it to be done.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Your conscience has allowed something to be done that cussing and
      swearing are godly worship to.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The prettiest maid is left out of harness, however,' said the clerk. 'The
      little witness was the chicken to my taste-Lord forgive me for saying it,
      and a man with a wife and family!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Sol and his father turned to withdraw, and soon forgot the remark, but it
      was frequently recalled by Christopher.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you think of trying to see Ethelberta before you leave?' said Sol.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Certainly not,' said Chickerel. 'Mr. Mountclere's advice was good in
      that. The more we keep out of the way the more good we are doing her. I
      shall go back to Anglebury by the carrier, and get on at once to London.
      You will go with me, I suppose?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The carrier does not leave yet for an hour or two.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I shall walk on, and let him overtake me. If possible, I will get one
      glimpse of Enckworth Court, Berta's new home; there may be time, if I
      start at once.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will walk with you,' said Sol.
    </p>
    <p>
      'There is room for one with me,' said Christopher. 'I shall drive back
      early in the afternoon.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Thank you,' said Sol. 'I will endeavour to meet you at Corvsgate.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus it was arranged. Chickerel could have wished to search for Picotee,
      and learn from her the details of this mysterious matter. But it was
      particularly painful to him to make himself busy after the event; and to
      appear suddenly and uselessly where he was plainly not wanted to appear
      would be an awkwardness which the pleasure of seeing either daughter could
      scarcely counterbalance. Hence he had resolved to return at once to town,
      and there await the news, together with the detailed directions as to his
      own future movements, carefully considered and laid down, which were sure
      to be given by the far-seeing Ethelberta.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sol and his father walked on together, Chickerel to meet the carrier just
      beyond Enckworth, Sol to wait for Christopher at Corvsgate. His wish to
      see, in company with his father, the outline of the seat to which
      Ethelberta had been advanced that day, was the triumph of youthful
      curiosity and interest over dogged objection. His father's wish was based
      on calmer reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher, lone and out of place, remained in the church yet a little
      longer. He desultorily walked round. Reaching the organ chamber, he looked
      at the instrument, and was surprised to find behind it a young man. Julian
      first thought him to be the organist; on second inspection, however, he
      proved to be a person Christopher had met before, under far different
      circumstances; it was our young friend Ladywell, looking as sick and sorry
      as a lily with a slug in its stalk.
    </p>
    <p>
      The occasion, the place, and their own condition, made them kin.
      Christopher had despised Ladywell, Ladywell had disliked Christopher; but
      a third item neutralized the other two-it was their common lot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher just nodded, for they had only met on Ethelberta's stairs.
      Ladywell nodded more, and spoke. 'The church appears to be interesting,'
      he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. Such a tower is rare in England,' said Christopher.
    </p>
    <p>
      They then dwelt on other features of the building, thence enlarging to the
      village, and then to the rocks and marine scenery, both avoiding the
      malady they suffered from-the marriage of Ethelberta.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The village streets are very picturesque, and the cliff scenery is good
      of its kind,' rejoined Ladywell. 'The rocks represent the feminine side of
      grandeur. Here they are white, with delicate tops. On the west coast they
      are higher, black, and with angular summits. Those represent grandeur in
      its masculine aspect. It is merely my own idea, and not very bright,
      perhaps.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is very ingenious,' said Christopher, 'and perfectly true.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Ladywell was pleased. 'I am here at present making sketches for my next
      subject-a winter sea. Otherwise I should not have-happened to be in the
      church.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are acquainted with Mrs. Petherwin-I think you are Mr. Ladywell, who
      painted her portrait last season?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' said Ladywell, colouring.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You may have heard her speak of Mr. Julian?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O yes,' said Ladywell, offering his hand. Then by degrees their tongues
      wound closer round the subject of their sadness, each tacitly owning to
      what he would not tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I saw it,' said Ladywell heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Did she look troubled?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not in the least-bright and fresh as a May morning. She has played me
      many a bitter trick, and poor Neigh too, a friend of mine. But I cannot
      help forgiving her. . . . I saw a carriage at the door, and strolled in.
      The ceremony was just proceeding, so I sat down here. Well, I have done
      with Knollsea. The place has no further interest for me now. I may own to
      you as a friend, that if she had not been living here I should have
      studied at some other coast-of course that's in confidence.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I understand, quite.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I only arrived in the neighbourhood two days ago, and did not set eyes
      upon her till this morning, she has kept so entirely indoors.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the young men parted, and half-an-hour later the ingenuous Ladywell
      came from the visitors' inn by the shore, a man walking behind him with a
      quantity of artists' materials and appliances. He went on board the
      steamer, which this morning had performed the passage in safety.
      Ethelberta single having been the loadstone in the cliffs that had
      attracted Ladywell hither, Ethelberta married was the negative pole of the
      same, sending him away. And thus did a woman put an end to the only
      opportunity of distinction, on Art-exhibition walls, that ever offered
      itself to the tortuous ways, quaint alleys, and marbled bluffs of
      Knollsea, as accessories in the picture of a winter sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher's interest in the village was of the same evaporating nature.
      He looked upon the sea, and the great swell, and the waves sending up a
      sound like the huzzas of multitudes; but all the wild scene was irksome
      now. The ocean-bound steamers far away on the horizon inspired him with no
      curiosity as to their destination; the house Ethelberta had occupied was
      positively hateful; and he turned away to wait impatiently for the hour at
      which he had promised to drive on to meet Sol at Corvsgate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sol and Chickerel plodded along the road, in order to skirt Enckworth
      before the carrier came up. Reaching the top of a hill on their way, they
      paused to look down on a peaceful scene. It was a park and wood, glowing
      in all the matchless colours of late autumn, parapets and pediments
      peering out from a central position afar. At the bottom of the descent
      before them was a lodge, to which they now descended. The gate stood
      invitingly open. Exclusiveness was no part of the owner's instincts: one
      could see that at a glance. No appearance of a well-rolled garden-path
      attached to the park-drive; as is the case with many, betokening by the
      perfection of their surfaces their proprietor's deficiency in hospitality.
      The approach was like a turnpike road full of great ruts, clumsy mendings;
      bordered by trampled edges and incursions upon the grass at pleasure.
      Butchers and bakers drove as freely herein as peers and peeresses.
      Christening parties, wedding companies, and funeral trains passed along by
      the doors of the mansion without check or question. A wild untidiness in
      this particular has its recommendations; for guarded grounds ever convey a
      suspicion that their owner is young to landed possessions, as religious
      earnestnesss implies newness of conversion, and conjugal tenderness recent
      marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half-an-hour being wanting as yet to Chickerel's time with the carrier,
      Sol and himself, like the rest of the world when at leisure, walked into
      the extensive stretch of grass and grove. It formed a park so large that
      not one of its owners had ever wished it larger, not one of its owner's
      rivals had ever failed to wish it smaller, and not one of its owner's
      satellites had ever seen it without praise. They somewhat avoided the
      roadway passing under the huge, misshapen, ragged trees, and through fern
      brakes, ruddy and crisp in their decay. On reaching a suitable eminence,
      the father and son stood still to look upon the many-chimneyed building,
      or rather conglomeration of buildings, to which these groves and glades
      formed a setting.
    </p>
    <p>
      'We will just give a glance,' said Chickerel, 'and then go away. It don't
      seem well to me that Ethelberta should have this; it is too much. The
      sudden change will do her no good. I never believe in anything that comes
      in the shape of wonderful luck. As it comes, so it goes. Had she been
      brought home today to one of those tenant-farms instead of these woods and
      walls, I could have called it good fortune. What she should have done was
      glorify herself by glorifying her own line of life, not by forsaking that
      line for another. Better have been admired as a governess than shunned as
      a peeress, which is what she will be. But it is just the same everywhere
      in these days. Young men will rather wear a black coat and starve than
      wear fustian and do well.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'One man to want such a monstrous house as that! Well, 'tis a fine place.
      See, there's the carpenters' shops, the timber-yard, and everything, as if
      it were a little town. Perhaps Berta may hire me for a job now and then.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I always knew she would cut herself off from us. She marked for it from
      childhood, and she has finished the business thoroughly.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, it is no matter, father, for why should we want to trouble her? She
      may write, and I shall answer; but if she calls to see me, I shall not
      return the visit; and if she meets me with her husband or any of her new
      society about her, I shall behave as a stranger.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It will be best,' said Chickerel. 'Well, now I must move.'
    </p>
    <p>
      However, by the sorcery of accident, before they had very far retraced
      their steps an open carriage became visible round a bend in the drive.
      Chickerel, with a servant's instinct, was for beating a retreat.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No,' said Sol. 'Let us stand our ground. We have already been seen, and
      we do no harm.'
    </p>
    <p>
      So they stood still on the edge of the drive, and the carriage drew near.
      It was a landau, and the sun shone in upon Lord Mountclere, with Lady
      Mountclere sitting beside him, like Abishag beside King David.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very blithe looked the viscount, for he rode upon a cherub to-day. She
      appeared fresh, rosy, and strong, but dubious; though if mien was
      anything, she was a viscountess twice over. Her dress was of a
      dove-coloured material, with a bonnet to match, a little tufted white
      feather resting on the top, like a truce-flag between the blood of noble
      and vassal. Upon the cool grey of her shoulders hung a few locks of hair,
      toned warm as fire by the sunshiny addition to its natural hue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chickerel instinctively took off his hat; Sol did the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      For only a moment did Ethelberta seem uncertain how to act. But a solution
      to her difficulty was given by the face of her brother. There she saw
      plainly at one glance more than a dozen speeches would have told-for Sol's
      features thoroughly expressed his intention that to him she was to be a
      stranger. Her eyes flew to Chickerel, and he slightly shook his head. She
      understood them now. With a tear in her eye for her father, and a sigh in
      her bosom for Sol, she bowed in answer to their salute; her husband moved
      his hat and nodded, and the carriage rolled on. Lord Mountclere might
      possibly be making use of the fine morning in showing her the park and
      premises. Chickerel, with a moist eye, now went on with his son towards
      the highroad. When they reached the lodge, the lodge-keeper was walking in
      the sun, smoking his pipe. 'Good morning,' he said to Chickerel.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Any rejoicings at the Court to-day?' the butler inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Quite the reverse. Not a soul there. 'Tisn't knowed anywhere at all. I
      had no idea of such a thing till he brought my lady here. Not going off,
      neither. They've come home like the commonest couple in the land, and not
      even the bells allowed to ring.'
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked along the public road, and the carrier came in view.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Father,' said Sol, 'I don't think I'll go further with you. She's gone
      into the house; and suppose she should run back without him to try to find
      us? It would be cruel to disappoint her. I'll bide about here for a
      quarter of an hour, in case she should. Mr. Julian won't have passed
      Corvsgate till I get there.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, one or two of her old ways may be left in her still, and it is not
      a bad thought. Then you will walk the rest of the distance if you don't
      meet Mr. Julian? I must be in London by the evening.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Any time to-night will do for me. I shall not begin work until to-morrow,
      so that the four o'clock train will answer my purpose.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus they parted, and Sol strolled leisurely back. The road was quite
      deserted, and he lingered by the park fence.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sol!' said a bird-like voice; 'how did you come here?'
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked up, and saw a figure peering down upon him from the top of the
      park wall, the ground on the inside being higher than the road. The
      speaker was to the expected Ethelberta what the moon is to the sun, a star
      to the moon. It was Picotee.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hullo, Picotee!' said Sol.
    </p>
    <p>
      'There's a little gate a quarter of a mile further on,' said Picotee. 'We
      can meet there without your passing through the big lodge. I'll be there
      as soon as you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Sol ascended the hill, passed through the second gate, and turned back
      again, when he met Picotee coming forward under the trees. They walked
      together in this secluded spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Berta says she wants to see you and father,' said Picotee breathlessly.
      'You must come in and make yourselves comfortable. She had no idea you
      were here so secretly, and she didn't know what to do.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Father's gone,' said Sol.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How vexed she will be! She thinks there is something the matter-that you
      are angry with her for not telling you earlier. But you will come in,
      Sol?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, I can't come in,' said her brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why not? It is such a big house, you can't think. You need not come near
      the front apartments, if you think we shall be ashamed of you in your
      working clothes. How came you not to dress up a bit, Sol? Still, Berta
      won't mind it much. She says Lord Mountclere must take her as she is, or
      he is kindly welcome to leave her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, well! I might have had a word or two to say about that, but the time
      has gone by for it, worse luck. Perhaps it is best that I have said
      nothing, and she has had her way. No, I shan't come in, Picotee. Father is
      gone, and I am going too.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O Sol!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'We are rather put out at her acting like this-father and I and all of us.
      She might have let us know about it beforehand, even if she is a lady and
      we what we always was. It wouldn't have let her down so terrible much to
      write a line. She might have learnt something that would have led her to
      take a different step.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But you will see poor Berta? She has done no harm. She was going to write
      long letters to all of you to-day, explaining her wedding, and how she is
      going to help us all on in the world.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Sol paused irresolutely. 'No, I won't come in,' he said. 'It would
      disgrace her, for one thing, dressed as I be; more than that, I don't want
      to come in. But I should like to see her, if she would like to see me; and
      I'll go up there to that little fir plantation, and walk up and down
      behind it for exactly half-an-hour. She can come out to me there.' Sol had
      pointed as he spoke to a knot of young trees that hooded a knoll a little
      way off.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll go and tell her,' said Picotee.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I suppose they will be off somewhere, and she is busy getting ready?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no. They are not going to travel till next year. Ethelberta does not
      want to go anywhere; and Lord Mountclere cannot endure this changeable
      weather in any place but his own house.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Poor fellow!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then you will wait for her by the firs? I'll tell her at once.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Picotee left him, and Sol went across the glade.

      46. ENCKWORTH (continued)-THE ANGLEBURY HIGHWAY
    </h2>
    <p>
      He had not paced behind the firs more than ten minutes when Ethelberta
      appeared from the opposite side. At great inconvenience to herself, she
      had complied with his request.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta was trembling. She took her brother's hand, and said, 'Is
      father, then, gone?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' said Sol. 'I should have been gone likewise, but I thought you
      wanted to see me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of course I did, and him too. Why did you come so mysteriously, and, I
      must say, unbecomingly? I am afraid I did wrong in not informing you of my
      intention.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'To yourself you may have. Father would have liked a word with you
      before-you did it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You both looked so forbidding that I did not like to stop the carriage
      when we passed you. I want to see him on an important matter-his leaving
      Mrs. Doncastle's service at once. I am going to write and beg her to
      dispense with a notice, which I have no doubt she will do.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He's very much upset about you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'My secrecy was perhaps an error of judgment,' she said sadly. 'But I had
      reasons. Why did you and my father come here at all if you did not want to
      see me?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'We did want to see you up to a certain time.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You did not come to prevent my marriage?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'We wished to see you before the marriage-I can't say more.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I thought you might not approve of what I had done,' said Ethelberta
      mournfully. 'But a time may come when you will approve.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't be harsh, Sol. A coronet covers a multitude of sins.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A coronet: good Lord-and you my sister! Look at my hand.' Sol extended
      his hand. 'Look how my thumb stands out at the root, as if it were out of
      joint, and that hard place inside there. Did you ever see anything so ugly
      as that hand-a misshaped monster, isn't he? That comes from the jackplane,
      and my pushing against it day after day and year after year. If I were
      found drowned or buried, dressed or undressed, in fustian or in
      broadcloth, folk would look at my hand and say, "That man's a carpenter."
      Well now, how can a man, branded with work as I be, be brother to a
      viscountess without something being wrong? Of course there's something
      wrong in it, or he wouldn't have married you-something which won't be
      righted without terrible suffering.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, no,' said she. 'You are mistaken. There is no such wonderful quality
      in a title in these days. What I really am is second wife to a quiet old
      country nobleman, who has given up society. What more commonplace? My life
      will be as simple, even more simple, than it was before.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Berta, you have worked to false lines. A creeping up among the useless
      lumber of our nation that'll be the first to burn if there comes a flare.
      I never see such a deserter of your own lot as you be! But you were always
      like it, Berta, and I am ashamed of ye. More than that, a good woman never
      marries twice.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are too hard, Sol,' said the poor viscountess, almost crying. 'I've
      done it all for you! Even if I have made a mistake, and given my ambition
      an ignoble turn, don't tell me so now, or you may do more harm in a minute
      than you will cure in a lifetime. It is absurd to let republican passions
      so blind you to fact. A family which can be honourably traced through
      history for five hundred years, does affect the heart of a person not
      entirely hardened against romance. Whether you like the peerage or no,
      they appeal to our historical sense and love of old associations.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't care for history. Prophecy is the only thing can do poor men any
      good. When you were a girl, you wouldn't drop a curtsey to 'em, historical
      or otherwise, and there you were right. But, instead of sticking to such
      principles, you must needs push up, so as to get girls such as you were
      once to curtsey to you, not even thinking marriage with a bad man too
      great a price to pay for't.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A bad man? What do you mean by that? Lord Mountclere is rather old, but
      he's worthy. What did you mean, Sol?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nothing-a mere sommat to say.'
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment Picotee emerged from behind a tree, and told her sister
      that Lord Mountclere was looking for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, Sol, I cannot explain all to you now,' she said. 'I will send for
      you in London.' She wished him goodbye, and they separated, Picotee
      accompanying Sol a little on his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta was greatly perturbed by this meeting. After retracing her
      steps a short distance, she still felt so distressed and unpresentable
      that she resolved not to allow Lord Mountclere to see her till the clouds
      had somewhat passed off; it was but a bare act of justice to him to hide
      from his sight such a bridal mood as this. It was better to keep him
      waiting than to make him positively unhappy. She turned aside, and went up
      the valley, where the park merged in miles of wood and copse.
    </p>
    <p>
      She opened an iron gate and entered the wood, casually interested in the
      vast variety of colours that the half-fallen leaves of the season wore:
      more, much more, occupied with personal thought. The path she pursued
      became gradually involved in bushes as well as trees, giving to the spot
      the character rather of a coppice than a wood. Perceiving that she had
      gone far enough, Ethelberta turned back by a path which at this point
      intersected that by which she had approached, and promised a more direct
      return towards the Court. She had not gone many steps among the hazels,
      which here formed a perfect thicket, when she observed a belt of
      holly-bushes in their midst; towards the outskirts of these an opening on
      her left hand directly led, thence winding round into a clear space of
      greensward, which they completely enclosed. On this isolated and mewed-up
      bit of lawn stood a timber-built cottage, having ornamental barge-boards,
      balconettes, and porch. It was an erection interesting enough as an
      experiment, and grand as a toy, but as a building contemptible.
    </p>
    <p>
      A blue gauze of smoke floated over the chimney, as if somebody was living
      there; round towards the side some empty hen-coops were piled away; while
      under the hollies were divers frameworks of wire netting and sticks,
      showing that birds were kept here at some seasons of the year.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being lady of all she surveyed, Ethelberta crossed the leafy sward, and
      knocked at the door. She was interested in knowing the purpose of the
      peculiar little edifice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door was opened by a woman wearing a clean apron upon a not very clean
      gown. Ethelberta asked who lived in so pretty a place.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Miss Gruchette,' the servant replied. 'But she is not here now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Does she live here alone?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes-excepting myself and a fellow-servant.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She lives here to attend to the pheasants and poultry, because she is so
      clever in managing them. They are brought here from the keeper's over the
      hill. Her father was a fancier.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Miss Gruchette attends to the birds, and two servants attend to Miss
      Gruchette?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, to tell the truth, m'm, the servants do almost all of it. Still,
      that's what Miss Gruchette is here for. Would you like to see the house?
      It is pretty.' The woman spoke with hesitation, as if in doubt between the
      desire of earning a shilling and the fear that Ethelberta was not a
      stranger. That Ethelberta was Lady Mountclere she plainly did not dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I fear I can scarcely stay long enough; yet I will just look in,' said
      Ethelberta. And as soon as they had crossed the threshold she was glad of
      having done so.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cottage internally may be described as a sort of boudoir extracted
      from the bulk of a mansion and deposited in a wood. The front room was
      filled with nicknacks, curious work-tables, filigree baskets, twisted
      brackets supporting statuettes, in which the grotesque in every case ruled
      the design; love-birds, in gilt cages; French bronzes, wonderful boxes,
      needlework of strange patterns, and other attractive objects. The
      apartment was one of those which seem to laugh in a visitor's face and on
      closer examination express frivolity more distinctly than by words.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Miss Gruchette is here to keep the fowls?' said Ethelberta, in a puzzled
      tone, after a survey.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. But they don't keep her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta did not attempt to understand, and ceased to occupy her mind
      with the matter. They came from the cottage to the door, where she gave
      the woman a trifling sum, and turned to leave. But footsteps were at that
      moment to be heard beating among the leaves on the other side of the
      hollies, and Ethelberta waited till the walkers should have passed. The
      voices of two men reached herself and the woman as they stood. They were
      close to the house, yet screened from it by the holly-bushes, when one
      could be heard to say distinctly, as if with his face turned to the
      cottage-
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lady Mountclere gone for good?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I suppose so. Ha-ha! So come, so go.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The speakers passed on, their backs becoming visible through the opening.
      They appeared to be woodmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What Lady Mountclere do they mean?' said Ethelberta.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman blushed. 'They meant Miss Gruchette.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh-a nickname.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why?'
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman whispered why in a story of about two minutes' length.
      Ethelberta turned pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is she going to return?' she inquired, in a thin hard voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes; next week. You know her, m'm?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No. I am a stranger.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'So much the better. I may tell you, then, that an old tale is flying
      about the neighbourhood-that Lord Mountclere was privately married to
      another woman, at Knollsea, this morning early. Can it be true?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I believe it to be true.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And that she is of no family?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of no family.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Indeed. Then the Lord only knows what will become of the poor thing.
      There will be murder between 'em.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Between whom?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Her and the lady who lives here. She won't budge an inch-not she!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta moved aside. A shade seemed to overspread the world, the sky,
      the trees, and the objects in the foreground. She kept her face away from
      the woman, and, whispering a reply to her Good-morning, passed through the
      hollies into the leaf-strewn path. As soon as she came to a large trunk
      she placed her hands against it and rested her face upon them. She drew
      herself lower down, lower, lower, till she crouched upon the leaves.
      'Ay-'tis what father and Sol meant! O Heaven!' she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She soon arose, and went on her way to the house. Her fair features were
      firmly set, and she scarcely heeded the path in the concentration which
      had followed her paroxysm. When she reached the park proper she became
      aware of an excitement that was in progress there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta's absence had become unaccountable to Lord Mountclere, who
      could hardly permit her retirement from his sight for a minute. But at
      first he had made due allowance for her eccentricity as a woman of genius,
      and would not take notice of the half-hour's desertion, unpardonable as it
      might have been in other classes of wives. Then he had inquired, searched,
      been alarmed: he had finally sent men-servants in all directions about the
      park to look for her. He feared she had fallen out of a window, down a
      well, or into the lake. The next stage of search was to have been drags
      and grapnels: but Ethelberta entered the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Mountclere rushed forward to meet her, and such was her contrivance
      that he noticed no change. The searchers were called in, Ethelberta
      explaining that she had merely obeyed the wish of her brother in going out
      to meet him. Picotee, who had returned from her walk with Sol, was
      upstairs in one of the rooms which had been allotted to her. Ethelberta
      managed to run in there on her way upstairs to her own chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Picotee, put your things on again,' she said. 'You are the only friend I
      have in this house, and I want one badly. Go to Sol, and deliver this
      message to him-that I want to see him at once. You must overtake him, if
      you walk all the way to Anglebury. But the train does not leave till four,
      so that there is plenty of time.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What is the matter?' said Picotee. 'I cannot walk all the way.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't think you will have to do that-I hope not.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He is going to stop at Corvsgate to have a bit of lunch: I might overtake
      him there, if I must!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. And tell him to come to the east passage door. It is that door next
      to the entrance to the stable-yard. There is a little yew-tree outside it.
      On second thoughts you, dear, must not come back. Wait at Corvsgate in the
      little inn parlour till Sol comes to you again. You will probably then
      have to go home to London alone; but do not mind it. The worst part for
      you will be in going from the station to the Crescent; but nobody will
      molest you in a four-wheel cab: you have done it before. However, he will
      tell you if this is necessary when he gets back. I can best fight my
      battles alone. You shall have a letter from me the day after to-morrow,
      stating where I am. I shall not be here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But what is it so dreadful?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nothing to frighten you.' But she spoke with a breathlessness that
      completely nullified the assurance. 'It is merely that I find I must come
      to an explanation with Lord Mountclere before I can live here permanently,
      and I cannot stipulate with him while I am here in his power. Till I
      write, good-bye. Your things are not unpacked, so let them remain here for
      the present-they can be sent for.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Picotee, more agitated than her sister, but never questioning her
      orders, went downstairs and out of the house. She ran across the
      shrubberies, into the park, and to the gate whereat Sol had emerged some
      half-hour earlier. She trotted along upon the turnpike road like a lost
      doe, crying as she went at the new trouble which had come upon Berta,
      whatever that trouble might be. Behind her she heard wheels and the
      stepping of a horse, but she was too concerned to turn her head. The pace
      of the vehicle slackened, however, when it was abreast of Picotee, and she
      looked up to see Christopher as the driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Miss Chickerel!' he said, with surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Picotee had quickly looked down again, and she murmured, 'Yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher asked what he could not help asking in the circumstances,
      'Would you like to ride?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I should be glad,' said she, overcoming her flurry. 'I am anxious to
      overtake my brother Sol.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have arranged to pick him up at Corvsgate,' said Christopher.
    </p>
    <p>
      He descended, and assisted her to mount beside him, and drove on again,
      almost in silence. He was inclined to believe that some supernatural
      legerdemain had to do with these periodic impacts of Picotee on his path.
      She sat mute and melancholy till they were within half-a-mile of
      Corvsgate.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Thank you,' she said then, perceiving Sol upon the road, 'there is my
      brother; I will get down now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He was going to ride on to Anglebury with me,' said Julian.
    </p>
    <p>
      Picotee did not reply, and Sol turned round. Seeing her he instantly
      exclaimed, 'What's the matter, Picotee?'
    </p>
    <p>
      She explained to him that he was to go back immediately, and meet her
      sister at the door by the yew, as Ethelberta had charged her. Christopher,
      knowing them so well, was too much an interested member of the group to be
      left out of confidence, and she included him in her audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And what are you to do?' said Sol to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am to wait at Corvsgate till you come to me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I can't understand it,' Sol muttered, with a gloomy face. 'There's
      something wrong; and it was only to be expected; that's what I say, Mr.
      Julian.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If necessary I can take care of Miss Chickerel till you come,' said
      Christopher.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Thank you,' said Sol. 'Then I will return to you as soon as I can, at the
      "Castle" Inn, just ahead. 'Tis very awkward for you to be so burdened by
      us, Mr. Julian; but we are in a trouble that I don't yet see the bottom
      of.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I know,' said Christopher kindly. 'We will wait for you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He then drove on with Picotee to the inn, which was not far off, and Sol
      returned again to Enckworth. Feeling somewhat like a thief in the night,
      he zigzagged through the park, behind belts and knots of trees, until he
      saw the yew, dark and clear, as if drawn in ink upon the fair face of the
      mansion. The way up to it was in a little cutting between shrubs, the door
      being a private entrance, sunk below the surface of the lawn, and
      invisible from other parts of the same front. As soon as he reached it,
      Ethelberta opened it at once, as if she had listened for his footsteps.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took him along a passage in the basement, up a flight of steps, and
      into a huge, solitary, chill apartment. It was the ball-room. Spacious
      mirrors in gilt frames formed panels in the lower part of the walls, the
      remainder being toned in sage-green. In a recess between each mirror was a
      statue. The ceiling rose in a segmental curve, and bore sprawling upon its
      face gilt figures of wanton goddesses, cupids, satyrs with tambourines,
      drums, and trumpets, the whole ceiling seeming alive with them. But the
      room was very gloomy now, there being little light admitted from without,
      and the reflections from the mirrors gave a depressing coldness to the
      scene. It was a place intended to look joyous by night, and whatever it
      chose to look by day.
    </p>
    <p>
      'We are safe here,' said she. 'But we must listen for footsteps. I have
      only five minutes: Lord Mountclere is waiting for me. I mean to leave this
      place, come what may.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why?' said Sol, in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I cannot tell you-something has occurred. God has got me in his power at
      last, and is going to scourge me for my bad doings-that's what it seems
      like. Sol, listen to me, and do exactly what I say. Go to Anglebury, hire
      a brougham, bring it on as far as Little Enckworth: you will have to meet
      me with it at one of the park gates later in the evening-probably the
      west, at half-past seven. Leave it at the village with the man, come on
      here on foot, and stay under the trees till just before six: it will then
      be quite dark, and you must stand under the projecting balustrade a little
      further on than the door you came in by. I will just step upon the balcony
      over it, and tell you more exactly than I can now the precise time that I
      shall be able to slip out, and where the carriage is to be waiting. But it
      may not be safe to speak on account of his closeness to me-I will hand
      down a note. I find it is impossible to leave the house by daylight-I am
      certain to be pursued-he already suspects something. Now I must be going,
      or he will be here, for he watches my movements because of some accidental
      words that escaped me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Berta, I shan't have anything to do with this,' said Sol. 'It is not
      right!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am only going to Rouen, to Aunt Charlotte!' she implored. 'I want to
      get to Southampton, to be in time for the midnight steamer. When I am at
      Rouen I can negotiate with Lord Mountclere the terms on which I will
      return to him. It is the only chance I have of rooting out a scandal and a
      disgrace which threatens the beginning of my life here! My letters to him,
      and his to me, can be forwarded through you or through father, and he will
      not know where I am. Any woman is justified in adopting such a course to
      bring her husband to a sense of her dignity. If I don't go away now, it
      will end in a permanent separation. If I leave at once, and stipulate that
      he gets rid of her, we may be reconciled.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I can't help you: you must stick to your husband. I don't like them, or
      any of their sort, barring about three or four, for the reason that they
      despise me and all my sort. But, Ethelberta, for all that I'll play fair
      with them. No half-and-half trimming business. You have joined 'em, and
      'rayed yourself against us; and there you'd better bide. You have married
      your man, and your duty is towards him. I know what he is and so does
      father; but if I were to help you to run away now, I should scorn myself
      more than I scorn him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't care for that, or for any such politics! The Mountclere line is
      noble, and how was I to know that this member was not noble, too? As the
      representative of an illustrious family I was taken with him, but as a
      man-I must shun him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How can you shun him? You have married him!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nevertheless, I won't stay! Neither law nor gospel demands it of me after
      what I have learnt. And if law and gospel did demand it, I would not stay.
      And if you will not help me to escape, I go alone.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You had better not try any such wild thing.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The creaking of a door was heard. 'O Sol,' she said appealingly, 'don't go
      into the question whether I am right or wrong-only remember that I am very
      unhappy. Do help me-I have no other person in the world to ask! Be under
      the balcony at six o'clock. Say you will-I must go-say you will!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll think,' said Sol, very much disturbed. 'There, don't cry; I'll try
      to be under the balcony, at any rate. I cannot promise more, but I'll try
      to be there.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She opened in the panelling one of the old-fashioned concealed modes of
      exit known as jib-doors, which it was once the custom to construct without
      architraves in the walls of large apartments, so as not to interfere with
      the general design of the room. Sol found himself in a narrow passage,
      running down the whole length of the ball-room, and at the same time he
      heard Lord Mountclere's voice within, talking to Ethelberta. Sol's escape
      had been marvellous: as it was the viscount might have seen her tears. He
      passed down some steps, along an area from which he could see into a row
      of servants' offices, among them a kitchen with a fireplace flaming like
      an altar of sacrifice. Nobody seemed to be concerned about him; there were
      workmen upon the premises, and he nearly matched them. At last he got
      again into the shrubberies and to the side of the park by which he had
      entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      On reaching Corvsgate he found Picotee in the parlour of the little inn,
      as he had directed. Mr. Julian, she said, had walked up to the ruins, and
      would be back again in a few minutes. Sol ordered the horse to be put in,
      and by the time it was ready Christopher came down from the hill. Room was
      made for Sol by opening the flap of the dogcart, and Christopher drove on.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was anxious to know the trouble, and Sol was not reluctant to share the
      burden of it with one whom he believed to be a friend. He told, scrap by
      scrap, the strange request of Ethelberta. Christopher, though ignorant of
      Ethelberta's experience that morning, instantly assumed that the discovery
      of some concealed spectre had led to this precipitancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      'When does she wish you to meet her with the carriage?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Probably at half-past seven, at the west lodge; but that is to be finally
      fixed by a note she will hand down to me from the balcony.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Which balcony?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The nearest to the yew-tree.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'At what time will she hand the note?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'As the Court clock strikes six, she says. And if I am not there to take
      her instructions of course she will give up the idea, which is just what I
      want her to do.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher begged Sol to go. Whether Ethelberta was right or wrong, he
      did not stop to inquire. She was in trouble; she was too clear-headed to
      be in trouble without good reason; and she wanted assistance out of it.
      But such was Sol's nature that the more he reflected the more determined
      was he in not giving way to her entreaty. By the time that they reached
      Anglebury he repented having given way so far as to withhold a direct
      refusal.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It can do no good,' he said mournfully. 'It is better to nip her notion
      in its beginning. She says she wants to fly to Rouen, and from there
      arrange terms with him. But it can't be done-she should have thought of
      terms before.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher made no further reply. Leaving word at the 'Red Lion' that a
      man was to be sent to take the horse of him, he drove directly onwards to
      the station.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then you don't mean to help her?' said Julian, when Sol took the
      tickets-one for himself and one for Picotee.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I serve her best by leaving her alone!' said Sol.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't think so.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She has married him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She is in distress.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She has married him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Sol and Picotee took their seats, Picotee upbraiding her brother. 'I can
      go by myself!' she said, in tears. 'Do go back for Berta, Sol. She said I
      was to go home alone, and I can do it!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You must not. It is not right for you to be hiring cabs and driving
      across London at midnight. Berta should have known better than propose
      it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She was flurried. Go, Sol!'
    </p>
    <p>
      But her entreaty was fruitless.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Have you got your ticket, Mr. Julian?' said Sol. 'I suppose we shall go
      together till we get near Melchester?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have not got my ticket yet-I'll be back in two minutes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The minutes went by, and Christopher did not reappear. The train moved
      off: Christopher was seen running up the platform, as if in a vain hope to
      catch it.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He has missed the train,' said Sol. Picotee looked disappointed, and said
      nothing. They were soon out of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      'God forgive me for such a hollow pretence!' said Christopher to himself.
      'But he would have been uneasy had he known I wished to stay behind. I
      cannot leave her in trouble like this!'
    </p>
    <p>
      He went back to the 'Red Lion' with the manner and movement of a man who
      after a lifetime of desultoriness had at last found something to do. It
      was now getting late in the afternoon. Christopher ordered a one-horse
      brougham at the inn, and entering it was driven out of the town towards
      Enckworth as the evening shades were beginning to fall. They passed into
      the hamlet of Little Enckworth at half-past five, and drew up at a
      beer-house at the end. Jumping out here, Julian told the man to wait till
      he should return.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus far he had exactly obeyed her orders to Sol. He hoped to be able to
      obey them throughout, and supply her with the aid her brother refused. He
      also hoped that the change in the personality of her confederate would
      make no difference to her intention. That he was putting himself in a
      wrong position he allowed, but time and attention were requisite for such
      analysis: meanwhile Ethelberta was in trouble. On the one hand was she
      waiting hopefully for Sol; on the other was Sol many miles on his way to
      town; between them was himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He ran with all his might towards Enckworth Park, mounted the lofty stone
      steps by the lodge, saw the dark bronze figures on the piers through the
      twilight, and then proceeded to thread the trees. Among these he struck a
      light for a moment: it was ten minutes to six. In another five minutes he
      was panting beneath the walls of her house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enckworth Court was not unknown to Christopher, for he had frequently
      explored that spot in his Sandbourne days. He perceived now why she had
      selected that particular balcony for handing down directions; it was the
      only one round the house that was low enough to be reached from the
      outside, the basement here being a little way sunk in the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went close under, turned his face outwards, and waited. About a foot
      over his head was the stone floor of the balcony, forming a ceiling to his
      position. At his back, two or three feet behind, was a blank wall-the wall
      of the house. In front of him was the misty park, crowned by a sky
      sparkling with winter stars. This was abruptly cut off upward by the dark
      edge of the balcony which overhung him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was as if some person within the room above had been awaiting his
      approach. He had scarcely found time to observe his situation when a human
      hand and portion of a bare arm were thrust between the balusters,
      descended a little way from the edge of the balcony, and remained hanging
      across the starlit sky. Something was between the fingers. Christopher
      lifted his hand, took the scrap, which was paper, and the arm was
      withdrawn. As it withdrew, a jewel on one of the fingers sparkled in the
      rays of a large planet that rode in the opposite sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Light steps retreated from the balcony, and a window closed. Christopher
      had almost held his breath lest Ethelberta should discover him at the
      critical moment to be other than Sol, and mar her deliverance by her
      alarm. The still silence was anything but silence to him; he felt as if he
      were listening to the clanging chorus of an oratorio. And then he could
      fancy he heard words between Ethelberta and the viscount within the room;
      they were evidently at very close quarters, and dexterity must have been
      required of her. He went on tiptoe across the gravel to the grass, and
      once on that he strode in the direction whence he had come. By the thick
      trunk of one of a group of aged trees he stopped to get a light, just as
      the Court clock struck six in loud long tones. The transaction had been
      carried out, through her impatience possibly, four or five minutes before
      the time appointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The note contained, in a shaken hand, in which, however, the well-known
      characters were distinguishable, these words in pencil:
    </p>
    <p>
      'At half-past seven o'clock. Just outside the north lodge; don't fail.'
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the time she had suggested to Sol as that which would probably
      best suit her escape, if she could escape at all. She had changed the
      place from the west to the north lodge-nothing else. The latter was
      certainly more secluded, though a trifle more remote from the course of
      the proposed journey; there was just time enough and none to spare for
      fetching the brougham from Little Enckworth to the lodge, the village
      being two miles off. The few minutes gained by her readiness at the
      balcony were useful now. He started at once for the village, diverging
      somewhat to observe the spot appointed for the meeting. It was excellently
      chosen; the gate appeared to be little used, the lane outside it was
      covered with trees, and all around was silent as the grave. After this
      hasty survey by the wan starlight, he hastened on to Little Enckworth.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour and a quarter later a little brougham without lamps was creeping
      along by the park wall towards this spot. The leaves were so thick upon
      the unfrequented road that the wheels could not be heard, and the horse's
      pacing made scarcely more noise than a rabbit would have done in limping
      along. The vehicle progressed slowly, for they were in good time. About
      ten yards from the park entrance it stopped, and Christopher stepped out.
    </p>
    <p>
      'We may have to wait here ten minutes,' he said to the driver. 'And then
      shall we be able to reach Anglebury in time for the up mail-train to
      Southampton?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Half-past seven, half-past eight, half-past nine-two hours. O yes, sir,
      easily. A young lady in the case perhaps, sir?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I hope she'll be done honestly by, even if she is of humble
      station. 'Tis best, and cheapest too, in the long run.' The coachman was
      apparently imagining the dove about to flit away to be one of the pretty
      maid-servants that abounded in Enckworth Court; such escapades as these
      were not unfrequent among them, a fair face having been deemed a
      sufficient recommendation to service in that house, without too close an
      inquiry into character, since the death of the first viscountess.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now then, silence; and listen for a footstep at the gate.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Such calmness as there was in the musician's voice had been produced by
      considerable effort. For his heart had begun to beat fast and loud as he
      strained his attentive ear to catch the footfall of a woman who could only
      be his illegally.
    </p>
    <p>
      The obscurity was as great as a starry sky would permit it to be. Beneath
      the trees where the carriage stood the darkness was total.

    <h2>
      47. ENCKWORTH AND ITS PRECINCTS-MELCHESTER
    </h2>
    <p>
      To be wise after the event is often to act foolishly with regard to it;
      and to preserve the illusion which has led to the event would frequently
      be a course that omniscience itself could not find fault with. Reaction
      with Ethelberta was complete, and the more violent in that it threatened
      to be useless. Sol's bitter chiding had been the first thing to discompose
      her fortitude. It reduced her to a consciousness that she had allowed
      herself to be coerced in her instincts, and yet had not triumphed in her
      duty. She might have pleased her family better by pleasing her tastes, and
      have entirely avoided the grim irony of the situation disclosed later in
      the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the second interview with Sol she was to some extent composed in
      mind by being able to nurse a definite intention. As momentum causes the
      narrowest wheel to stand upright, a scheme, fairly imbibed, will give the
      weakest some power to maintain a position stoically.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the temporary absence of Lord Mountclere, about six o'clock, she
      slipped out upon the balcony and handed down a note. To her relief, a hand
      received it instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hour and a half wanting to half-past seven she passed with great
      effort. The main part of the time was occupied by dinner, during which she
      attempted to devise some scheme for leaving him without suspicion just
      before the appointed moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Happily, and as if by a Providence, there was no necessity for any such
      thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little while before the half-hour, when she moved to rise from dinner,
      he also arose, tenderly begging her to excuse him for a few minutes, that
      he might go and write an important note to his lawyer, until that moment
      forgotten, though the postman was nearly due. She heard him retire along
      the corridor and shut himself into his study, his promised time of return
      being a quarter of an hour thence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five minutes after that memorable parting Ethelberta came from the little
      door by the bush of yew, well and thickly wrapped up from head to heels.
      She skimmed across the park and under the boughs like a shade, mounting
      then the stone steps for pedestrians which were fixed beside the park
      gates here as at all the lodges. Outside and below her she saw an oblong
      shape-it was a brougham, and it had been drawn forward close to the bottom
      of the steps that she might not have an inch further to go on foot than to
      this barrier. The whole precinct was thronged with trees; half their
      foliage being overhead, the other half under foot, for the gardeners had
      not yet begun to rake and collect the leaves; thus it was that her dress
      rustled as she descended the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      The carriage door was held open by the driver, and she entered instantly.
      He shut her in, and mounted to his seat. As they drove away she became
      conscious of another person inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O! Sol-it is done!' she whispered, believing the man to be her brother.
      Her companion made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta, familiar with Sol's moods of troubled silence, did not press
      for an answer. It was, indeed, certain that Sol's assistance would have
      been given under a sullen protest; even if unwilling to disappoint her, he
      might well have been taciturn and angry at her course.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat in silence, and in total darkness. The road ascended an incline,
      the horse's tramp being still deadened by the carpet of leaves. Then the
      large trees on either hand became interspersed by a low brushwood of
      varied sorts, from which a large bird occasionally flew, in its fright at
      their presence beating its wings recklessly against the hard stems with
      force enough to cripple the delicate quills. It showed how deserted was
      the spot after nightfall.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sol?' said Ethelberta again. 'Why not talk to me?'
    </p>
    <p>
      She now noticed that her fellow-traveller kept his head and his whole
      person as snugly back in the corner, out of her way, as it was possible to
      do. She was not exactly frightened, but she could not understand the
      reason. The carriage gave a quick turn, and stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Where are we now?' she said. 'Shall we get to Anglebury by nine? What is
      the time, Sol?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will see,' replied her companion. They were the first words he had
      uttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice was so different from her brother's that she was terrified; her
      limbs quivered. In another instant the speaker had struck a wax vesta, and
      holding it erect in his fingers he looked her in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hee-hee-hee!' The laugher was her husband the viscount.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed again, and his eyes gleamed like a couple of tarnished brass
      buttons in the light of the wax match.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelberta might have fallen dead with the shock, so terrible and hideous
      was it. Yet she did not. She neither shrieked nor fainted; but no poor
      January fieldfare was ever colder, no ice-house more dank with
      perspiration, than she was then.
    </p>
    <p>
      'A very pleasant joke, my dear-hee-hee! And no more than was to be
      expected on this merry, happy day of our lives. Nobody enjoys a good jest
      more than I do: I always enjoyed a jest-hee-hee! Now we are in the dark
      again; and we will alight and walk. The path is too narrow for the
      carriage, but it will not be far for you. Take your husband's arm.'
    </p>
    <p>
      While he had been speaking a defiant pride had sprung up in her,
      instigating her to conceal every weakness. He had opened the carriage door
      and stepped out. She followed, taking the offered arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Take the horse and carriage to the stables,' said the viscount to the
      coachman, who was his own servant, the vehicle and horse being also his.
      The coachman turned the horse's head and vanished down the woodland track
      by which they had ascended.
    </p>
    <p>
      The viscount moved on, uttering private chuckles as numerous as a
      woodpecker's taps, and Ethelberta with him. She walked as by a miracle,
      but she would walk. She would have died rather than not have walked then.
    </p>
    <p>
      She perceived now that they were somewhere in Enckworth wood. As they
      went, she noticed a faint shine upon the ground on the other side of the
      viscount, which showed her that they were walking beside a wet ditch. She
      remembered having seen it in the morning: it was a shallow ditch of mud.
      She might push him in, and run, and so escape before he could extricate
      himself. It would not hurt him. It was her last chance. She waited a
      moment for the opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      'We are one to one, and I am the stronger!' she at last exclaimed
      triumphantly, and lifted her hand for a thrust.
    </p>
    <p>
      'On the contrary, darling, we are one to half-a-dozen, and you
      considerably the weaker,' he tenderly replied, stepping back adroitly, and
      blowing a whistle. At once the bushes seemed to be animated in four or
      five places.
    </p>
    <p>
      'John?' he said, in the direction of one of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, my lord,' replied a voice from the bush, and a keeper came forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      'William?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Another man advanced from another bush.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Quite right. Remain where you are for the present. Is Tomkins there?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, my lord,' said a man from another part of the thicket.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You go and keep watch by the further lodge: there are poachers about.
      Where is Strongway?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Just below, my lord.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Tell him and his brother to go to the west gate, and walk up and down.
      Let them search round it, among the trees inside. Anybody there who cannot
      give a good account of himself to be brought before me to-morrow morning.
      I am living at the cottage at present. That's all I have to say to you.'
      And, turning round to Ethelberta: 'Now, dearest, we will walk a little
      further if you are able. I have provided that your friends shall be taken
      care of.' He tried to pull her hand towards him, gently, like a cat
      opening a door.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked a little onward, and Lord Mountclere spoke again, with
      imperturbable good-humour:
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will tell you a story, to pass the time away. I have learnt the art
      from you-your mantle has fallen upon me, and all your inspiration with it.
      Listen, dearest. I saw a young man come to the house to-day. Afterwards I
      saw him cross a passage in your company. You entered the ball-room with
      him. That room is a treacherous place. It is panelled with wood, and
      between the panels and the walls are passages for the servants, opening
      from the room by doors hidden in the woodwork. Lady Mountclere knew of one
      of these, and made use of it to let out her conspirator; Lord Mountclere
      knew of another, and made use of it to let in himself. His sight is not
      good, but his ears are unimpaired. A meeting was arranged to take place at
      the west gate at half-past seven, unless a note handed from the balcony
      mentioned another time and place. He heard it all-hee-hee!
    </p>
    <p>
      'When Lady Mountclere's confederate came for the note, I was in waiting
      above, and handed one down a few minutes before the hour struck,
      confirming the time, but changing the place. When Lady Mountclere handed
      down her note, just as the clock was striking, her confederate had gone,
      and I was standing beneath the balcony to receive it. She dropped it into
      her husband's hands-ho-ho-ho-ho!
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lord Mountclere ordered a brougham to be at the west lodge, as fixed by
      Lady Mountclere's note. Probably Lady Mountclere's friend ordered a
      brougham to be at the north gate, as fixed by my note, written in
      imitation of Lady Mountclere's hand. Lady Mountclere came to the spot she
      had mentioned, and like a good wife rushed into the arms of her
      husband-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!'
    </p>
    <p>
      As if by an ungovernable impulse, Ethelberta broke into laughter
      also-laughter which had a wild unnatural sound; it was hysterical. She
      sank down upon the leaves, and there continued the fearful laugh just as
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Mountclere became greatly frightened. The spot they had reached was a
      green space within a girdle of hollies, and in front of them rose an
      ornamental cottage. This was the building which Ethelberta had visited
      earlier in the day: it was the Petit Trianon of Enckworth Court.
    </p>
    <p>
      The viscount left her side and hurried forward. The door of the building
      was opened by a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Have you prepared for us, as I directed?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, my lord; tea and coffee are both ready.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never mind that now. Lady Mountclere is ill; come and assist her indoors.
      Tell the other woman to bring wine and water at once.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He returned to Ethelberta. She was better, and was sitting calmly on the
      bank. She rose without assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You may retire,' he said to the woman who had followed him, and she
      turned round. When Ethelberta saw the building, she drew back quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Where is the other Lady Mountclere?' she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Gone!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She shall never return-never?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never. It was not intended that she should.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That sounds well. Lord Mountclere, we may as well compromise matters.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I think so too. It becomes a lady to make a virtue of a necessity.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It was stratagem against stratagem. Mine was ingenious; yours was
      masterly! Accept my acknowledgment. We will enter upon an armed
      neutrality.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No. Let me be your adorer and slave again, as ever. Your beauty, dearest,
      covers everything! You are my mistress and queen! But here we are at the
      door. Tea is prepared for us here. I have a liking for life in this
      cottage mode, and live here on occasion. Women, attend to Lady
      Mountclere.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman who had seen Ethelberta in the morning was alarmed at
      recognizing her, having since been informed officially of the marriage:
      she murmured entreaties for pardon. They assisted the viscountess to a
      chair, the door was closed, and the wind blew past as if nobody had ever
      stood there to interrupt its flight.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Full of misgivings, Christopher continued to wait at the north gate.
      Half-past seven had long since been past, and no Ethelberta had appeared.
      He did not for the moment suppose the delay to be hers, and this gave him
      patience; having taken up the position, he was induced by fidelity to
      abide by the consequences. It would be only a journey of two hours to
      reach Anglebury Station; he would ride outside with the driver, put her
      into the train, and bid her adieu for ever. She had cried for help, and he
      had heard her cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last through the trees came the sound of the Court clock striking
      eight, and then, for the first time, a doubt arose in his mind whether she
      could have mistaken the gate. She had distinctly told Sol the west lodge;
      her note had expressed the north lodge. Could she by any accident have
      written one thing while meaning another? He entered the carriage, and
      drove round to the west gate. All was as silent there as at the other, the
      meeting between Ethelberta and Lord Mountclere being then long past; and
      he drove back again.
    </p>
    <p>
      He left the carriage, and entered the park on foot, approaching the house
      slowly. All was silent; the windows were dark; moping sounds came from the
      trees and sky, as from Sorrow whispering to Night. By this time he felt
      assured that the scheme had miscarried. While he stood here a carriage
      without lights came up the drive; it turned in towards the stable-yard
      without going to the door. The carriage had plainly been empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Returning across the grass by the way he had come, he was startled by the
      voices of two men from the road hard by.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Have ye zeed anybody?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not a soul.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Shall we go across again?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What's the good? let's home to supper.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'My lord must have heard somebody, or 'a wouldn't have said it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Perhaps he's nervous now he's living in the cottage again. I thought that
      fancy was over. Well, I'm glad 'tis a young wife he's brought us. She'll
      have her routs and her rackets as well as the high-born ones, you'll see,
      as soon as she gets used to the place.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She must be a queer Christian to pick up with him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, if she've charity 'tis enough for we poor men; her faith and hope
      may be as please God. Now I be for on-along homeward.'
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as they had gone Christopher moved from his hiding, and, avoiding
      the gravel-walk, returned to his coachman, telling him to drive at once to
      Anglebury.
    </p>
    <p>
      Julian was so impatient of the futility of his adventure that he wished to
      annihilate its existence. On reaching Anglebury he determined to get on at
      once to Melchester, that the event of the night might be summarily ended;
      to be still in the neighbourhood was to be still engaged in it. He reached
      home before midnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Walking into their house in a quiet street, as dissatisfied with himself
      as a man well could be who still retained health and an occupation, he
      found Faith sitting up as usual. His news was simple: the marriage had
      taken place before he could get there, and he had seen nothing of either
      ceremony or viscountess. The remainder he reserved for a more convenient
      season.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edith looked anxiously at him as he ate supper, smiling now and then.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I am tired of this life,' said Christopher.
    </p>
    <p>
      'So am I,' said Faith. 'Ah, if we were only rich!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Or if we were not rich,' she said, turning her eyes to the fire. 'If we
      were only slightly provided for, it would be better than nothing. How much
      would you be content with, Kit?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'As much as I could get.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Would you be content with a thousand a year for both of us?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I daresay I should,' he murmured, breaking his bread.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Or five hundred for both?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Or five hundred.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Or even three hundred?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Bother three hundred. Less than double the sum would not satisfy me. We
      may as well imagine much as little.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Faith's countenance had fallen. 'O Kit,' she said, 'you always disappoint
      me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I do. How do I disappoint you this time?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'By not caring for three hundred a year-a hundred and fifty each-when that
      is all I have to offer you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Faith!' said he, looking up for the first time. 'Ah-of course! Lucy's
      will. I had forgotten.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is true, and I had prepared such a pleasant surprise for you, and now
      you don't care! Our cousin Lucy did leave us something after all. I don't
      understand the exact total sum, but it comes to a hundred and fifty a year
      each-more than I expected, though not so much as you deserved. Here's the
      letter. I have been dwelling upon it all day, and thinking what a pleasure
      it would be; and it is not after all!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good gracious, Faith, I was only supposing. The real thing is another
      matter altogether. Well, the idea of Lucy's will containing our names! I
      am sure I would have gone to the funeral had I known.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I wish it were a thousand.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no-it doesn't matter at all. But, certainly, three hundred for two is a
      tantalizing sum: not enough to enable us to change our condition, and
      enough to make us dissatisfied with going on as we are.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'We must forget we have it, and let it increase.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It isn't enough to increase much. We may as well use it. But how? Take a
      bigger house-what's the use? Give up the organ?-then I shall be rather
      worse off than I am at present. Positively, it is the most provoking
      amount anybody could have invented had they tried ever so long. Poor Lucy,
      to do that, and not even to come near us when father died. . . . Ah, I
      know what we'll do. We'll go abroad-we'll live in Italy.'

    <h2>
      SEQUEL. ANGLEBURY-ENCKWORTH-SANDBOURNE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Two years and a half after the marriage of Ethelberta and the evening
      adventures which followed it, a man young in years, though considerably
      older in mood and expression, walked up to the 'Red Lion' Inn at
      Anglebury. The anachronism sat not unbecomingly upon him, and the voice
      was precisely that of the Christopher Julian of heretofore. His way of
      entering the inn and calling for a conveyance was more off-hand than
      formerly; he was much less afraid of the sound of his own voice now than
      when he had gone through the same performance on a certain chill evening
      the last time that he visited the spot. He wanted to be taken to Knollsea
      to meet the steamer there, and was not coming back by the same vehicle.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a very different day from that of his previous journey along the
      same road; different in season; different in weather; and the humour of
      the observer differed yet more widely from its condition then than did the
      landscape from its former hues. In due time they reached a commanding
      situation upon the road, from which were visible knots and plantations of
      trees on the Enckworth manor. Christopher broke the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lord Mountclere is still alive and well, I am told?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O ay. He'll live to be a hundred. Never such a change as has come over
      the man of late years.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Indeed!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, 'tis my lady. She's a one to put up with! Still, 'tis said here and
      there that marrying her was the best day's work that he ever did in his
      life, although she's got to be my lord and my lady both.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is she happy with him?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She is very sharp with the pore man-about happy I don't know. He was a
      good-natured old man, for all his sins, and would sooner any day lay out
      money in new presents than pay it in old debts. But 'tis altered now.
      'Tisn't the same place. Ah, in the old times I have seen the floor of the
      servants' hall over the vamp of your boot in solid beer that we had poured
      aside from the horns because we couldn't see straight enough to pour it
      in. See? No, we couldn't see a hole in a ladder! And now, even at
      Christmas or Whitsuntide, when a man, if ever he desires to be overcome
      with a drop, would naturally wish it to be, you can walk out of Enckworth
      as straight as you walked in. All her doings.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then she holds the reins?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She do! There was a little tussle at first; but how could a old man hold
      his own against such a spry young body as that! She threatened to run away
      from him, and kicked up Bob's-a-dying, and I don't know what all; and
      being the woman, of course she was sure to beat in the long run. Pore old
      nobleman, she marches him off to church every Sunday as regular as a
      clock, makes him read family prayers that haven't been read in Enckworth
      for the last thirty years to my certain knowledge, and keeps him down to
      three glasses of wine a day, strict, so that you never see him any the
      more generous for liquor or a bit elevated at all, as it used to be.
      There, 'tis true, it has done him good in one sense, for they say he'd
      have been dead in five years if he had gone on as he was going.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'So that she's a good wife to him, after all.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, if she had been a little worse 'twould have been a little better
      for him in one sense, for he would have had his own way more. But he was a
      curious feller at one time, as we all know and I suppose 'tis as much as
      he can expect; but 'tis a strange reverse for him. It is said that when
      he's asked out to dine, or to anything in the way of a jaunt, his eye
      flies across to hers afore he answers: and if her eye says yes, he says
      yes: and if her eye says no, he says no. 'Tis a sad condition for one who
      ruled womankind as he, that a woman should lead him in a string whether he
      will or no.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sad indeed!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She's steward, and agent, and everything. She has got a room called "my
      lady's office," and great ledgers and cash-books you never see the like.
      In old times there were bailiffs to look after the workfolk, foremen to
      look after the tradesmen, a building-steward to look after the foremen, a
      land-steward to look after the building-steward, and a dashing grand agent
      to look after the land-steward: fine times they had then, I assure ye. My
      lady said they were eating out the property like a honeycomb, and then
      there was a terrible row. Half of 'em were sent flying; and now there's
      only the agent, and the viscountess, and a sort of surveyor man, and of
      the three she does most work so 'tis said. She marks the trees to be
      felled, settles what horses are to be sold and bought, and is out in all
      winds and weathers. There, if somebody hadn't looked into things 'twould
      soon have been all up with his lordship, he was so very extravagant. In
      one sense 'twas lucky for him that she was born in humble life, because
      owing to it she knows the ins and outs of contriving, which he never did.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then a man on the verge of bankruptcy will do better to marry a poor and
      sensible wife than a rich and stupid one. Well, here we are at the tenth
      milestone. I will walk the remainder of the distance to Knollsea, as there
      is ample time for meeting the last steamboat.'
    </p>
    <p>
      When the man was gone Christopher proceeded slowly on foot down the hill,
      and reached that part of the highway at which he had stopped in the cold
      November breeze waiting for a woman who never came. He was older now, and
      he had ceased to wish that he had not been disappointed. There was the
      lodge, and around it were the trees, brilliant in the shining greens of
      June. Every twig sustained its bird, and every blossom its bee. The
      roadside was not muffled in a garment of dead leaves as it had been then,
      and the lodge-gate was not open as it always used to be. He paused to look
      through the bars. The drive was well kept and gravelled; the grass
      edgings, formerly marked by hoofs and ruts, and otherwise trodden away,
      were now green and luxuriant, bent sticks being placed at intervals as a
      protection.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he looked through the gate a woman stepped from the lodge to open
      it. In her haste she nearly swung the gate into his face, and would have
      completely done so had he not jumped back.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I beg pardon, sir,' she said, on perceiving him. 'I was going to open it
      for my lady, and I didn't see you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher moved round the corner. The perpetual snubbing that he had
      received from Ethelberta ever since he had known her seemed about to be
      continued through the medium of her dependents.
    </p>
    <p>
      A trotting, accompanied by the sound of light wheels, had become
      perceptible; and then a vehicle came through the gate, and turned up the
      road which he had come down. He saw the back of a basket carriage, drawn
      by a pair of piebald ponies. A lad in livery sat behind with folded arms;
      the driver was a lady. He saw her bonnet, her shoulders, her hair-but no
      more. She lessened in his gaze, and was soon out of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood a long time thinking; but he did not wish her his.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this wholesome frame of mind he proceeded on his way, thankful that he
      had escaped meeting her, though so narrowly. But perhaps at this remote
      season the embarrassment of a rencounter would not have been intense. At
      Knollsea he entered the steamer for Sandbourne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Chickerel and his family now lived at Firtop Villa, in that place, a
      house which, like many others, had been built since Julian's last visit to
      the town. He was directed to the outskirts, and into a fir plantation
      where drives and intersecting roads had been laid out, and where new
      villas had sprung up like mushrooms. He entered by a swing gate, on which
      'Firtop' was painted, and a maid-servant showed him into a
      neatly-furnished room, containing Mr. Chickerel, Mrs. Chickerel, and
      Picotee, the matron being reclined on a couch, which improved health had
      permitted her to substitute for a bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been expected, and all were glad to see again the sojourner in
      foreign lands, even down to the ladylike tabby, who was all purr and
      warmth towards him except when she was all claws and nippers. But had the
      prime sentiment of the meeting shown itself it would have been the
      unqualified surprise of Christopher at seeing how much Picotee's face had
      grown to resemble her sister's: it was less a resemblance in contours than
      in expression and tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had an early tea, and then Mr. Chickerel, sitting in a patriarchal
      chair, conversed pleasantly with his guest, being well acquainted with him
      through other members of the family. They talked of Julian's residence at
      different Italian towns with his sister; of Faith, who was at the present
      moment staying with some old friends in Melchester: and, as was
      inevitable, the discourse hovered over and settled upon Ethelberta, the
      prime ruler of the courses of them all, with little exception, through
      recent years.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It was a hard struggle for her,' said Chickerel, looking reflectively out
      at the fir trees. 'I never thought the girl would have got through it.
      When she first entered the house everybody was against her. She had to
      fight a whole host of them single-handed. There was the viscount's
      brother, other relations, lawyers, ladies, servants, not one of them was
      her friend; and not one who wouldn't rather have seen her arrive there in
      evil relationship with him than as she did come. But she stood her ground.
      She was put upon her mettle; and one by one they got to feel there was
      somebody among them whose little finger, if they insulted her, was thicker
      than a Mountclere's loins. She must have had a will of iron; it was a
      situation that would have broken the hearts of a dozen ordinary women, for
      everybody soon knew that we were of no family, and that's what made it so
      hard for her. But there she is as mistress now, and everybody respecting
      her. I sometimes fancy she is occasionally too severe with the servants
      and I know what service is. But she says it is necessary, owing to her
      birth; and perhaps she is right.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I suppose she often comes to see you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Four or five times a year,' said Picotee.
    </p>
    <p>
      'She cannot come quite so often as she would,' said Mrs. Chickerel,
      'because of her lofty position, which has its juties. Well, as I always
      say, Berta doesn't take after me. I couldn't have married the man even
      though he did bring a coronet with him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I shouldn't have cared to let him ask ye,' said Chickerel. 'However,
      that's neither here nor there-all ended better than I expected. He's fond
      of her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And it is wonderful what can be done with an old man when you are his
      darling,' said Mrs. Chickerel.
    </p>
    <p>
      'If I were Berta I should go to London oftener,' said Picotee, to turn the
      conversation. 'But she lives mostly in the library. And, O, what do you
      think? She is writing an epic poem, and employs Emmeline as her reader.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dear me. And how are Sol and Dan? You mentioned them once in your
      letters,' said Christopher.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Berta has set them up as builders in London.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She bought a business for them,' said Chickerel. 'But Sol wouldn't accept
      her help for a long time, and now he has only agreed to it on condition of
      paying her back the money with interest, which he is doing. They have just
      signed a contract to build a hospital for twenty thousand pounds.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Picotee broke in-'You knew that both Gwendoline and Cornelia married two
      years ago, and went to Queensland? They married two brothers, who were
      farmers, and left England the following week. Georgie and Myrtle are at
      school.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And Joey?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'We are thinking of making Joseph a parson,' said Mrs. Chickerel.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Indeed! a parson.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes; 'tis a genteel living for the boy. And he's talents that way. Since
      he has been under masters he knows all the strange sounds the old Romans
      and Greeks used to make by way of talking, and the love stories of the
      ancient women as if they were his own. I assure you, Mr. Julian, if you
      could hear how beautiful the boy tells about little Cupid with his bow and
      arrows, and the rows between that pagan apostle Jupiter and his wife
      because of another woman, and the handsome young gods who kissed Venus,
      you'd say he deserved to be made a bishop at once!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening advanced, and they walked in the garden. Here, by some means,
      Picotee and Christopher found themselves alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Your letters to my sister have been charming,' said Christopher. 'And so
      regular, too. It was as good as a birthday every time one arrived.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Picotee blushed and said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher had full assurance that her heart was where it always had
      been. A suspicion of the fact had been the reason of his visit here
      to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Other letters were once written from England to Italy, and they acquired
      great celebrity. Do you know whose?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Walpole's?' said Picotee timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes; but they never charmed me half as much as yours. You may rest
      assured that one person in the world thinks Walpole your second.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You should not have read them; they were not written to you. But I
      suppose you wished to hear of Ethelberta?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'At first I did,' said Christopher. 'But, oddly enough, I got more
      interested in the writer than in her news. I don't know if ever before
      there has been an instance of loving by means of letters. If not, it is
      because there have never been such sweet ones written. At last I looked
      for them more anxiously than Faith.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You see, you knew me before.' Picotee would have withdrawn this remark if
      she could, fearing that it seemed like a suggestion of her love long ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then, on my return, I thought I would just call and see you, and go away
      and think what would be best for me to do with a view to the future. But
      since I have been here I have felt that I could not go away to think
      without first asking you what you think on one point-whether you could
      ever marry me?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I thought you would ask that when I first saw you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Did you. Why?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You looked at me as if you would.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well,' continued Christopher, 'the worst of it is I am as poor as Job.
      Faith and I have three hundred a year between us, but only half is mine.
      So that before I get your promise I must let your father know how poor I
      am. Besides what I mention, I have only my earnings by music. But I am to
      be installed as chief organist at Melchester soon, instead of deputy, as I
      used to be; which is something.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am to have five hundred pounds when I marry. That was Lord Mountclere's
      arrangement with Ethelberta. He is extremely anxious that I should marry
      well.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's unfortunate. A marriage with me will hardly be considered well.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O yes, it will,' said Picotee quickly, and then looked frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher drew her towards him, and imprinted a kiss upon her cheek, at
      which Picotee was not so wretched as she had been some years before when
      he mistook her for another in that performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Berta will never let us come to want,' she said, with vivacity, when she
      had recovered. 'She always gives me what is necessary.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'We will endeavour not to trouble her,' said Christopher, amused by
      Picotee's utter dependence now as ever upon her sister, as upon an eternal
      Providence. 'However, it is well to be kin to a coach though you never
      ride in it. Now, shall we go indoors to your father? You think he will not
      object?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I think he will be very glad,' replied Picotee. 'Berta will, I know.'

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.



Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
